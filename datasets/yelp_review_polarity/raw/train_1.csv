0,"You people cannot all be serious....\n\nAfter being lured in by the clean signage (which looks remarkably similar to gamestop... in fact this is originally how we found out about this place...) the simple menu, and a decent smell I must admit I am completely dissapointed.\n\nCourt ordered a 1/3 while I splurged for the 1/2 pound burger, we mixed it up with sweet potato fires, and onion strings what we found was the following.\n\nEvery person who eats here must be;\n\nFat and used to having to dig around the grease pool our burgers were swimming in.\nStupid by being conned into paying $25 dollars (we shared a drink) for $5 worth of burger materials and $2 worth of the measliest portion of fries possible....\n\nMy 1/2 pound burger was flat as a pancake and had literally 2 inches of meat in a ring around the bun.....slothered with a sickening sweet BBQ sauce, cheese and a single onion string, it had completley (I mean literally) soaked both sides of the bun with grease to the point where I removed the bun and squeezed it our as you might ring out a towel.....gross.  The onion strings were okay for pre bought stuff, you can get the same thing at chilis except they charge $1 less and actually strain them before serving.\n\nCourts burger at least fit the bun (points for that) but was salty as anything which suggests they are keeping the meat way longer than they should......same issues with the grease.....literally I feel acne growing on my face just thinking about it....\n\nThe sweet potato fries were uninspired and greasy again, I have never had a bad sweet potato fry until yesterday......I guess it had to happen sooner or later.\n\nI must admit after eating at literally hundreds of burger joints this is by far the worst which is sad because there is major potential\n\nWe got about halfway through our meal before we couldn't stomach it anymore....I have a stomach of iron....and felt sick all day after eating just 1/4 of a burger and a few onion strings and fries.....\n\nMain Complaints;\n\nGrease and Ingredients\nMeasly portions of sides (for $3 a side I would expect more....)\nSmallest Drinks I have ever seen ($3 for a 'Large' for what McDonalds calls a small.... come on people)\n\nLong story short if this was my only option I would starve.....best of luck to all you facing this grease burger the only thing I wanted to smash after finishing was my face into a toilet bowl....."
0,"Just not the same place it use to be since 2003.   when ever I take my kids I am always waiting  30 min to 50 just to be seen with a scheduled appt. Their are always new doctors and $60. With no insurance! \nThat worries me, is it the doctors that are right fir the practice or is it a horrible place to work and who can afford that just unbelievable!! I will be looking for a new place to bring my babies \nCorrection over an hour and half wait wow!  \nThe nurse just told me usually there's only a 10 minute wait I said yeah right I've never gotten that since 2004 I've always had a ridiculous wait"
1,"This place has a great patio PLUS a great selection of microbrews.  I loved the setup of this place- great front and back patio-dog friendly too.  The back patio setup is awesome.  Great view of Camelback Mountain and the bicycle wall with the tires that are fans is super cool!  We came on Father's Day and for their BBQ Sunday special and we were not disappointed.  The special was great, huge portions.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Our waitress gave great recommendations and did not steer us wrong. Can't wait to go back!"
1,"I stopped by today for a second opinion on my breaks.\nWas quoted $351.00 for repairs on my breaks at another place\"" just breaks\""\nCame here, they looked at my breaks and reported to me there \nwas another 10,000 miles left on the pads and the caliper \nwas just fine. No work was needed at this time,\nWow, most places would have tried to sell me something.\nWill definatey use them in the future, friendly service, honest people, \nSydney, you didn't steer me wrong with this one, thanks."
1,"Read a lot of reviews, some great, some not so great. So me and my buddy decide to go check it out for ourselves. We go on a Saturday at 1:30pm, which I figured was a good time since it SHOULD be just after lunch. But not at the Diamond as it was wall to wall crowded!\n\nSo we get seated in under 10 minutes, and we both decide to get the burgers since it was our first time here. I've been in Charlotte 2 years now, and have had some pretty good burgers, but I wanted to see if this was \""the mecca\"" for Burgers. \n\nA week before, I decided to check out the Penguin and I admit that their Burgers were damn good! So I thought, No way can the Diamond's be any better. Boy was I wrong! I got the double and my buddy went for the Full Hemi (3 patties for a full pound)! We both ordered it Medium and they both came that way. Always worry about that especially when a Restaurant is super busy like the Diamond.\n\nSo bottom line - the Burgers were cooked to PERFECTION! Super juicy deliciousness (fatty beef content for FLAVOR) and their Fries were home cut and made quite well. \n\nOh, we started the meal with the Fried Pickles as my buddy never had a GOOD version of this dish. And man did we both love them! Crispy with good seasoning (some Cheyenne?) served with Ranch! Oh so yummy!\n\nBack to the burgers.....so after asking for many additional Napkins (which is a GREAT sign at a burger joint because you know it's super juicy), we both stated out loud that this is the BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! Penguin was a close second, only edged out by the Diamond because they cooked my burger to a PERFECT MEDIUM with a nice red/pink center. \n\nSo it's a 1 - 2 race, with the Diamond in a close lead!\n\nOverall, a DELICIOUS lunch with a prompt and friendly staff, despite the crowd (another good sign when people literally line up out the door).\n\nCan't wait to come back! If you're craving a GREAT burger, come here!\n\n5 Star Rating is for their AWESOME Burger and Fries!"
0,"Raised prices and coupons don,t include any 12 inch sandwich specials. Used to buy here weekly but no longer can afford it especially with the fact that they give less meat and cheese then Port of Subs."
0,"Watch your fingers!!! My friends and I went to this restaurant expecting great food and great service. I have to admit the food was good, but the management at the restaurant was absolutely terrible! One of the servers cut my friend's finger with a knife. They were initially apologetic, however, when the manager came out he was the most ridiculous person I've ever met. He stated he would not comp the meal because the \""cut was not that big\"" despite the blood soaked napkin my friend had on the table that suggested otherwise. He was unable to define how large the cut needed to be before he was willing to pay for the meal. He then began arguing with my friend as she was upset with the way he handled the situation. This place may have decent food, but this by far was MY WORST EXPERIENCE IN VEGAS!!!"
1,"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday. It was hard to find exactly where the restaurant was located and then when we found it, there was no one there to greet us. After waiting for a few minutes someone came to seat us. Service was very slow but kind and food was delicious! Great place for a yummy hot sandwich, burger, or salad!! Just make sure you are not constrained by time at all when you dine here. We will definitely be back and we are looking forward to trying dinner here soon!"
1,"Always love my stays at Starwood properties!\n\nThis is a very new building with modern decor. The staff is always top notch at a Westin which is great. \n\nYes, it's pricey but worth every penny!"
1,"I stopped into this location a few weeks ago because I heard that my company had negotiated a better discount for employees and, obviously, I wanted to get it. They weren't busy, so I was helped immediately. When I told the salesperson my situation I proceeded to get all of the paperwork out to verify my employment. He told me to put it all away because he had everything he needed already and that he'd look through some different options to make sure I was getting the best discount. After just a few minutes he had everything sorted out, told me I was going to save an additional 10% off of my bill and sent me on my way. He did actually point me toward accessories before I left, but he prefaced it by telling me that my company gets a sweet discount on them. I declined and he thanked me for using Verizon and told me to have a good day. It was a refreshing experience, seeing that so many cell-phone stores are trying to hard-sell everybody on everything. I'll definitely be back to this location!"
1,"Siu wok is a clean, fast, and decent chinese take out option for cenpho foodies.\nI still havent found truly authentic and amazing Chinese food in Az. but this is about as good as a chinese-american take out place you could ask for. \nThey have some really great deals as far as lunch options and combo meals are considered, and their wait staff is attentive and subservient to say the least. \nI would say that this is really an 3 star \""A-Ok\"" type of joint, but the clean atmosphere, cheap prices, and portion size here really bumped it up another star. It's always hard to rate Az chinese restaurants, as I feel like that isnt something that we do so well down in the SW, as compared to the NW or cali, so maybe my rating is a little askew. However I will say this: be you in central Phoenix one night, and if you feel like some comforting chinese take out that isnt overly greasy, than Siu Wok is a perfectly viable option.\nThe Lo-Mein, cold, straight outta the fridge the next morning is a wonderful breakfast."
0,"Slow, slow, service. Did I mention it's slow? The food was fine, but not worth waiting 30 minutes for it. Go somewhere else if you have a hankering for Mexican and anywhere to be soon."
0,"I gave this Starbucks three chances before writing this review. They are VERY slow in the mornings and not really all that friendly. Mind you, I'm not very friendly until after about half of my coffee is gone but still, I expect good service regardless of the time of day. I don't know if many employees are new, but they really don't seem like they operate well together or in an organized fashion. Never messed up my drink, but after the long wait and bad service, I'll just stick to the coffee at work."
0,"Second time here and sooo awful. The sliders were bland and the fries weren't any better than Burger King. That's saying alot me thinks. And service at the bar was incredibly horrible. SO unfriendly, SO unhelpful, SO impersonal! We asked for the beer menu and were given dirty looks with our menu. What's up with that? I asked for one of the beers in the cold case from Dogfish Head - again the dirty looks and silence. I felt like I was in some sort of time warp here. Luckily the beer was cold, and I'd never pass up the Dogfish Head Raison d'etre. It's amazing. Skip the Burger Bar and go next door."
1,"Great deep dish pizza! For some reason I thought the smaller pizzas off the bar menu tasted better than the same type of pizza, but larger size off the reg menu. Go figure."
0,"I've been here about 4 times; the hygienists have always been nice and friendly, and they do a good job.  The latest one was particularly helpful and provided useful advice.  However, when the dentist actually came to examine me, his bedside manner was not very friendly; he appeared rushed and was a bit rough during his examination.  He seems young, and that's not a bad thing, but that may be a factor in his inexperience.  He also spoke to his assistant about me and my dental needs as if I weren't sitting right there in the exam chair.  Felt awkward and uncomfortable.  \nAfter the exam, I was then escorted to the special room where they provide the pricing for the dental procedures I need.  The pricing specialist was friendly and nice--that is, until I said I couldn't make an appointment for the $500 procedure I needed.  I just don't have the money right now, and I tried explaining that, but the mood sure changed when the pricing specialist realized I couldn't do it.  Yikes.  I realize that they're running a business, but this isn't the first time that I felt as if they were more concerned with getting my money than actually helping with my dental needs.  \nUnfortunately, I will probably return to Southwest Dental because it's close to where I live and appointments are relatively easy to acquire, but I won't go there happily, unfortunately."
0,"Please skip this hotel and go to Circus Circus or some other budget hotels. There was a bed bug problem in my first room on the 3rd floor so I mentioned it to the gentlemen at the lobby so he transferred me to another room (also on the 3rd floor). Turns that the replacement room also has bed bugs. I believe this is a bed bug infested hotel which requires immediate attention. Be careful with this one. Granted it is low priced but I guess you get what you pay for....cheap price for poor experience. This is the first and last time I'm ever staying here. If you do decide to stay here, good luck and bring a lot of calamine lotion"
1,"My new favorite buffet! I'm so glad I got lazy to drive to the M Buffet and was willing to wait an hour for the Bacchanal Buffet. First off, it's $37.99 for Total Rewards members so make sure to show them your card! It's newly renovated and the place looks amazing, but the food is the more important thing. Their king crab legs were fresh and can be steamed if you prefer. The oysters were actually sweet and clean. The prime rib was tender but I felt the au jus lacked real flavor. There's a noodle soup station with pretty decent bowls of pho!  There was also ramen and wonton noodles, but I didn't have enough stomach space to try them all. Sushi was fresh but there wasn't a large selection to choose from. Chicken herbal soup loaded with actual chicken and herbs! The halibut was juicy. The seafood paella was moist. Oh, they even have the mexican corn with the mayo, parmesan, and chili powder! Also, the tamales were great. The best part was the dessert section and I don't usually leave room for desserts. They have crepes made-to-order and ice cream a la modes. There were a lot more that I tried and some I didn't get to try, but there was nothing I disliked. In my opinion, they have restaurant quality food and a great selection at that. This is like a dream buffet! Worth the $$ and the wait - DONT MISS OUT!"
1,"Oh wow! Delicious! So good!\n\nRandomly took the kids last night for a treat and apparently we have awesome luck because this is some of the best gelato I've ever I had. I got the caramel macchiato and the kids got strawberry and bubble gum. Flavors are fresh, bold, and well-balanced. They even put a vanilla pirroette on top. So adorable and I just love it when a place pays attention to detail! Then an employee came around with a tray of water. Awesome! Customer service was really great.\n\nThe only downside is that the place was so packed (on a Thursday!) that I didn't get to sample anything because I felt so rushed. Maybe I'll come in on a weekday morning so I can take my time sampling! Also, this is a total Mormon hangout. I'm not bothered by that at all but just so people are aware."
1,"In 2011, I think I am going to be a bit more \""tough\"" in my reviews.  So, consider this four star rating a very good rating.  After moving from Dallas, I have not adjusted well to the Mexican food of Phoenix.  Nothing matched the Tex-Mex (not surprising), and every place people told me to go seemed to lack flavor.  Well.... the Spotted Donkey hit the spot (hehe).  It is not Tex-Mex more Southwestern/Mexican but the really important fact is the food is delicious and full of flavor.  Margaritas are better than tasty.  The restaurant sophisticated but very comfortable with a back and front patio-- both with fireplaces.  We had the nachos as a appetizer at the recommendation of wise yelpers.... very good.  Prices here a very fair, it looks like happy hour is a great deal.  I look forward to another visit soon!"
0,"What a shit hole!\nIf you are thinking about going here - STOP.\nThis place makes me want to take up smoking so I can subdue my appetite. It's dirty, the food is of questionable quality.\n\nPlease stop giving your money to this place."
0,this one is even worse than the other Dunkin donuts. Customer service? Non existent. Drinks made right? Hardly. Food warm and declicious? Not a chance. I go out of my way to not get coffee here.. And it's a shame since it's on my way to work. I'll stick to Dutch bros.. Better coffee and 100X better customer service.
0,"I went here for quite awhile and was always satisfied with their service. One day last summer, I walked in and saw the same lady that always did my eyebrows (I never knew her name). As we were talking, she (for whatever reason) felt the need to inform me I had put on weight and asked me if I was pregnant. I couldn't even believe her. I walked out in tears and to this day am shocked she has a job in customer service."
1,"Bring your appetite, the sandwiches are huge!! They all carry mafia inspired names and probably contain at least a full day's worth of calories. Take for instance the Big Freakin BLT, this thing has at least a full pound of bacon on it. Then there's the Mac-Daddy, tons of turkey, cheese, lettuce and a huge ball of fried macaroni and cheese on it. The Broken Fingers (chicken fingers) are accompanied by fries with an irresistible dust on them, yum! \n\nMy only beefs (no pun intended) are the canned sodas, I need more than 12 oz.. and the common unavailability of one item or another. In fact I'm not sure I've even been able to order something exactly as it's described on the menu, however, the food has always been great. I have not been disappointed!"
0,"firstly, they get 2 stars cause of the good effort and the sincere service of the wait staff, who are obviously anime fans and like all things Japanese :) but seriously, very attentive and good service, only reasoin why i give them 2 stars\n\noverpriced and very average broth.  For like 7 bucks u get 3 thin slices of \""char-shiu\"" , some sprouts, some golden mushroom and decent amt of noodles.  But realy, its 2 bucks to add 3 more slices of char shiu ?  and like 1 dollar to add sprouts ?  come on, thats a rip off.  \n\nThe only reason U go here is if u are too lazy to drive to somewhere better and really must have a hot bowl of ramen.  In this case I guess U can settle for this, but if U just want soup, go down to Khai Hoang on Apache and Mcclintock and U get much much better and more ingredients soupy broth noodles.\n\nDun go here for ramen if U can, go to like iKitchen or Sushi Ken, either one will top this place hands down."
0,"Are you familiar with the plague?  No, not hanging out with it?  Then you'll want to similarly avoid this place.  \n\nIncredibly rude, and flat-out incompetent nail technicians make for a manicure you'll not forget.  I wanted a french manicure on my natural nails.  The tech asked nothing about how I wanted my nails cut, started whacking away, leaving only the barest bit of nail sticking out from the tip, cut them crookedly, and then filed away half of what was remaining.  He did make to sure to tell me (repeatedly) that they don't fix french nail paint chips for free.  Whatever- just stop making a disaster of my hands so that I can run home and fix it myself."
0,Update: Got some food to go for my wife and myself on Sunday. And it was horrible! My wife got a french dip and it was just fat and the rest of the meat was tough and disgusting. Very unhappy with my experience. So i will not eat there again.
1,"Everything here was good. We had the waffles, chocolate covered strawberries, beignets with jam and took home some strawberry pie, and chocolate chip cookie. We washed it all down with caramel iced coffee and it was all delicious! Clean restaurant, nice decor, better than anything I could find on the strip. Perfect!"
0,"Plusses\n- Plenty of parking: Fran's is located in the same strip mall with Run for your Life and Fiamma, which means there's parking galore.\n- Attentive waitstaff: Fran herself came over to chat with us and brought crayons for the 2 year old at our table\n- Ecclectic homey food: bacon wrapped tator tots?  Fried sweet corn with goat cheese ranch dressing?  Meatballs with gooey melted cheese?  Don't mind if I do.\n- Generous portion size: I like to eat, as does everyone I was with, and we were stuffed after our meal.  \n- Price: reasonable, especially considering portion size.  The seafood options are a bit more expensive, but that's to be expected.\n\nMinusses\n- Odd table layout: the front room holds ~10 tables and bar seating, but as you head to the bathroom in the back, there are tables along the hallway and oddly placed near the kitchen pickup window\n- Menu confusion: Reading the menu, I just want to exclaim \""what IS this place?\""  Deviled eggs, nicoise salad, eggplant parmesan, buffalo fried chicken sandwich, and mussels (three ways: traditional, curry/coconut, or beer/bacon) all co-habitate on the menu.  On one hand, that might mean everyone can find something they like.  On the other hand, it's just weird.  What does Fran's want to be when it grows up?  \n- Food quality & flavors: it's not bad, but it's not amazing either.  The macaroni & cheese side was bland, the lamb ragu was not as good as it had been talked up to be, the chicken milanese was just so-so.  However, the goat cheese was incredible; the goat cheese ranch dressing is a wonderful little cup of surprise (dunk all the way to the bottom, and you'll be rewarded with chunks of soft goat cheese.  You're welcome) and the goat cheese salad that came with the chicken milanese was my favorite of the whole meal.  Moral of the story: if it has goat cheese, GET IT."
0,"I absolutely LOVE the Blanco's in north Tucson. The food is fabulous, the views are incredible and the service is impeccable. The Scottsdale location is not so great. My husband and I went here for an early dinner one night and we waited for a table for what felt like an eternity (even though there were only like 6 other diners) and our waitress frequently forgot about us. Then to top it off, I got sick after eating my tacos! My husband enjoyed his meal and his margarita but we won't return."
0,"We went for a second time (found out later it was 2 weeks after the chef departed).\n\nSurf and turf roll - tasteless.\nFried rock shrimp - OK\nSent the dessert back, as they may have made the donut part to order, but then filled it with almost frozen yuzu cr\u00e8me.\n\nIt's really a shame, as I like the concept and it's close to where I live... let's hope the next chef whips it back in shape."
0,"This dry cleaner recently took over from the previous owners that I decided to stop going to because they didn't accommodate alterations on site. My daughter wanted a neighborhood cleaner to bring her Sanctuary Elements uniform to...a Diane Von Furstenberg dress that she has to have cleaned weekly. She asked me to drop off her dress so I decided to add a White House/Black Market cotton/viscose sweater to be cleaned. White House is my go-to store for all my work clothes.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the dress and sweater, my sweater was BEIGE!!! The young girl behind the counter saw my face and said \""Is their something wrong?\"" I said \""Yes, my white sweater looks like its been ruined. It was white.\"" She said \""I'm sorry, we've had trouble with the guy in the back.  I will put it back through to be cleaned again.\""  I relented.\n\nA week later I went to pick it up. Now, let me tell you. A cotton and viscose sweater has a shiny thread appearance to it. It is has a lusterous rather than matte fabric.  My sweater looked beat-up, dingy, grayed, frayed and lacked the original luster it held. Obviously, the cleaners damaged it the first time and in order to get the discoloration or polluted smog out of it they had to bleach it. The sweater recommends you use non-chlorine bleach. It has the option to hand wash or dry clean. The owner Martin happened to be the one I was greeted by upon pick up. I very calmly spoke to him and told him I was not happy. I said, \""My sweater is ruined. It's lost its white color and is quite frayed. It's not shiny anymore.\"" He said, \""I am sorry and paused.\"" I said, \""I would like it replaced.\"" He said, \""You will have to find your receipt. Bring a copy of your receipt and I will reimburse you.\"" I agreed and he asked to retain the sweater.\n\nThis sweater wasn't horribly expensive. It was $88 but i got it on sale for $66.88. I keep all my receipts and found it. I returned one week later and left off a copy of the receipt with a new clerk.  I was told I would get a call when my check was ready to be picked up.\n\nI didn't get a call back. This was a busy time for me so i finally got over there on Christmas Eve to pick up my reimbursement check. Martin was there. He said \""I am not going to reimburse you. I took your sweater to the White House/Black Market store and spoke to two sales people and the manager. I compared your sweater to another similar sweater and everyone agreed it was just like new.\"" I was flabbergasted.  I said, \""You're kidding right? You went to the store?  I'm embarrassed for you. You can't tell it has been ruined? Your clerk said that you had trouble with another work who turned it beige.\""  He said something like ... the sweater was cleaned properly and I have been reassured by the store it is in its original condition.  I don't remember what he said after that.  I can't believe a store would not stand by its customer's disapproval of their services and not make amends.  \n\nYou guys!  My sweater is un-wearable! It's off to Goodwill. I am not the kind of person to get mad at vendors. I don't complain and if you ask anyone I am usually overly agreeable and provoke a group consensus. \n\nI also am going to write customer service at White House. I find them to be a reputable company that stands behind their products. I think Martin wanted to be right instead of satisfying a customer. All over $66.88. Ridiculous!  I would not recommend this company. My daughter has told the Sanctuary to not use this dry cleaner either for their uniforms. \n\nThey have two locations. Please don't go to either one of them. at 3375 E. Shea Blvd. or 9301 E. Shea Blvd."
0,"My husband and I recently tried Rita's after so many friends raved about it. \nWe were so so disappointed. The combined outside patio area with a group singing so loud we couldn't hear each other in a conversation. The food and Margaritas we fair, the constant fly's made it difficult to relax and enjoy the atmosphere. \nNot a fan."
1,"Waited a LONG time for them to complete their remodel.  It was well worth it!!\nThe food is amazing!!  \nWonderful hummus, tzadziki, gyros....\nI would highly recommend checking this place out!"
1,"Top notch place in Ballantyne area to be pampered.  Super nice, professional staff.  \n\nIt's more than just a mani or pedi.  There is a massage aspect that is unbeatable.\n\nThe price is excellent.  Convenient parking and lots of things to do in the area.\n\nFamily owned and operated.  And they don't mind helping out the occasional dude keeping himself presentable for wife."
1,"The desserts are to die for! :)\nThe actual buffet is  decent. Very clean, Good service. \nI loved the jumbo shrimps and Asian section a lot. \nGood selection of cheese as well, but deserts are sent straight from heaven and to top it off they have high quality tea bags, that just adds to the experience."
0,"I couldn't see her face all night, so honestly I wouldn't have known if it was her dancing/singing or an imposture. Also she barely spoke to the crowd all night, other than the standard \""Hey Vegas\"". The lines for the bar were ridiculously long and SLOW moving, I'm shocked that they don't staff more people."
1,After 5 months in Charlotte and trying out various restaurants I can say that Pio Pio is my FAVORITE restaurant here. I get the 1/4 chicken dinner -- once with tostones and once with plantains. AWESOME. The chicken is perfectly cooked and the tostones and plantains are nice and sweet. Then there is the savory beans. Never have enough room for the rice. Haha. I'm sure other stuff here must be good too -- but can't resist the chicken!
1,"As I said in my last review, when I come back to Vegas I will for sure come back & GUESS WHAT?! I did :)\n\nAgain, I gave up meat for Lent so I couldn't get what I got last time which was oh-so-yummers (the chicken chipotle avocado) so I decided on the CAPRESE (I think that's what it's called) & it was so yummy! I ate the WHOLE sandwich, yup. Quite a feat for me, if you knew me. Yes I went here after leaving Pure so I was 'Happy Camille.' Either way, I am so glad that they have vegetarian alternatives that taste just as good as their regular meat sandwiches :)"
0,"I ordered a blush with Boba my first time here. Let me tell you, I am never going back again. It tasted bitter and it was very chunky at the top and watery at the bottom. This place is always packed and I waited 10 minutes in line for disappointment. I recommend going to a place called \""the street\"" in Mesa az. It might be a little further but they are worth it."
0,"Witless, appallingly amateurish,ugly ,boring, unentertaining, stupid, musically flat,yawn-inducing,talentless, catastrophically bad. That and more describes the \""new\"" reboot of the oldest and now longest ( in every sense of the word) previously spectacular show girl show JUBILEE playing at Bally's in Las Vegas.\n\nHow anyone could try to modernize what was a great classic spectacular without adding one original idea to the mix is beyond comprehension. Every new \""piece\"" is a lame badly done rip-off reflecting poorly on it's original source. Numbers like the Rich Man's Frug lifted entirely from Bob Fosse's choreography from Sweet Charity dangle with no sense of purpose or design. The running order and flow of the show is an ill conceived hodgepodge of half baked transitions from one dismal number to the next.\n\nThe two great and affectionately cheesy set piece numbers that stood out for thirty years, namely the Samson And Delilah piece and The Sinking Of The a Titanic have been neutered beyond recognition.  The former now looks like a barely competent high school production and the latter like some uninspired lip synching drag show. The girls are still gorgeous but the boys are mostly second rate faceless and insipid dancing twerps.\n\nWhat was once a charming,sumptuous eye filling tribute to showgirls (and boys) has become a drab tiresome empty charmless parody of it's once great self with choreography of the school of aerobics kind. Only when on the rare occasion the showgirls fill the stage with some of the original Bob Mackie costumes, do you see flashes of the original production that remain to remind one of what a fabulous show it once used to be. \n\nI watched in in despair hoping it would get better, as many wiser audience members fled way before the final curtain. If Bally's intention was to destroy their one great legendary and iconic spectacle, they have done an admirable job. But why?\n\nIf you have ever seen the show before, give it a wide berth as you will be sadly disappointed. If you haven't and if amateurish mediocrity thinly decorated with bare breasts, ugly new projections, dark and sinister lighting (the once great kick line of chorus girls in star-spangled outfits is now a darkly lit sinister mess)  and talentless shtick turns your crank, then by all means go waste your money on this shadow of a great former show. But better do it quick, as I don't see it surviving for long."
0,"This was my second visit attempting to use a $25.00 Restaurant.com certificate.  The first visit I realized that with plate prices between 9.50 and 12.50 that between two of us, we couldn't possibly meet the minimum purchase of $50.00.  My second attempt to use the $25.00 off was tonight with 3 friends.  We started off with an appetizer of Chicken Satay with peanut sauce and a cucumber salad.  YUM.  For entrees, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Pad Wu Sen, and Squash Curry.  Very good, all of it.  The noodles on the Pad Se Ew were overdone, but OK.  The problem came with the billing.  The $25 off Restaurant.com certificate clearly stated that it was not valid on Saturdays.  Well, it was Friday night.  Our server said that the certificate was no good on weekends.  I clearly stated, showed her the highlighted exclusion for Saturdays, that it was Friday night, and that the exclusion is not for weekend nights...just Saturday.  She understood, and asked her co-worker to explain to us that the coupon isn't good on weekends.  I again said, it is Friday.  It's no good on Saturday.  She left, talked to a cook who hollered at her and nobody came back to talk to us and re-explain why the certificate was no good.  We left the full balance of the bill, plus generous tip, but will not go back.  It was very frustrating."
0,"These guys can't even walk away from BS throw away tickets without a fine, and they are super optimistic when they tell you the amount, like they did you a solid. They do absolutely NO extra arguing that would be worth while to pay for their services, just go to court yourself and get the same or BETTER results. What a Rip-off."
0,"I went here on a pub crawl after being turned away from an overcrowed Majerles during one of the Cardinal's game. I was surprised to find the place nearly empty when just down the road Majerles had people falling out the door, but after ordering a few round of drinks I soon found out why the place was empty. The bar tender and manager were annoyed by the size of our group. When most empty bars would probably embrace 25 people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemire's staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed.  The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced.  I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups.  For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business."
0,"I dont mind paying for good pizza and wings. I do mind paying for average pizza and average wings. There are so many good pizza spots in vegas I'm disappointed I payed 40 dollars for a pizza and dozen wings that was average at best. Im not from chicago so maybe  I get it but the crust on the pizza not very good. To be fair the rest of the pizza is good. The wings were clearly frozen and then tossed in sauce. Nothing great, and then to cap it off, my biggest pet peeve for a pizza spot is when they water down the ranch. I know we are in a recession but quality should not be the first thing to go. I do have to give credit to the delivery guy, i love when i dont have to ask for parmesan and crushed red peppers. With the variety of choices for pizza available in summerlin I probably wont order again."
1,"In the summer, wifee & I were in Lake Tahoe at the same time Soundgarden were playing. We went, she suffered, I enjoyed and tonight was payback. Celine Dion at The Colosseum. \n\nThere is no Celine on my iPod, there will never be Celine on my iPod. Celine? Not for me. \n\nThe Colosseum is a magniificent venue, I believe that Caesars should use it for much more than the rotation of superstars they have on the payroll. Many artists and their fans would enjoy a night at the legendary Caesars Palace. Seating is comfortable, there is not a bad view in the house, the acoustics are very good and there are huge video screens that seem a part of all today's shows. You're welcome Caesars.\n\nSo Celine? The show is very good, she obviously has a large catalogue of her hits, but she also throws in some Michael Jackson numbers. ( She learned to speak English ONLY after watching MJ! ) . There is a James Bond medley, she cries after singing a French song. It's all very dramatic. I saw a woman in the lobby with some Celine lyrics tattooed on her back!!!' That's a fan.\n\nShe is skinny and beautiful and with the exception ( IMHO ) of a big shouldered MJ jacket, every costume was beautiful and quite obviously NOT from TJ Maxx. \n\nShe doesn't dance around as much as her last residency show but there are cute videos of her kids, a prior world tour and she engages the audience very naturally. A true pro. \n\nShe is one of the all-time great female vocalists and whether you love or you're indifferent to Celine, the show is extremely entertaining, is very popular and is a cast iron certainty to keep the lady in your life happy. Happy wife, happy life. ( Corny but a rule to live by....)"
1,"I don't normally come to this laundromat, but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and I was getting desparate.  Although parking can be a bit of a pain, I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin' 50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working great.  It's air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah, and they have a change machine that apparently takes 20, 10, 5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again, I will be coming here."
1,"A Groupon deal made this a really good value. I thought the portions and quality made the regular price at least fair. On my second vist, the portions were a little smaller. I think the non Japonese sushi chef is a little less skilled and a little less gernerous. Overall, I am happy to report a good experience."
0,"There are so many unique and tasty dining experiences to be had in Pittsburgh that you should never waste your time or money here. The food is less than decent- for instance, a flatbread described as topped with lamb and tsatsiki which was a cold, deconstructed gyro from a mall food court, and an order of mussels of which only 6/12 were actually opened after cooking- e.g., 1/2 the order was inedible (and the sauce tasted like watered down Prego). The service was so-so and there was nothing at all special about the atmosphere. We will never be back."
0,"Since my last post we have been three more times (all within the past month), and only because we were invited to birthday parties.  I am still shocked by how unsafe this place seems.  I had hoped they would have installed better safety controls - better padding and more staff.  At the last party, they did have one \""referee\"" on the floor, but every time I saw him he was rough housing as bad as the kids - flipping kids over, pushing them down slides, etc.  He was a part of the chaos vs. controlling it.  Again, on all three visits, there were multiple kids crying from injuries."
0,The lady was unhelpful and seemed annoyed by all my questions I was asking her. This place is expensive with a large smoothie being over 6 bucks. I ordered the mango slushi w/ boba. My slushi was watery and felt like there was hardly any boba in it. Go to Easy Life.
1,Amazing food! Great friendly people. You feel at home eating amazingly food. It wasn't very crowded so the guy took time to learn my name and check up on me and the meal I ordered. \nI had the spinach ravioli and it was light and delicious and well flavored. I also had the wonderfully garlic garlic knots - to die for. \nCan't wait to come back as try more
0,"After dinner at one night, my husband and I walked over to Nova's Bakery.  I got a piece of cake, but was horribly disappointed.  The cake was dry as if it were a few days old.  I was also disappointed with their selection of baked goods at the counter.  I expected more from a bakery that gets so much foot traffic.  They have a very limited selection."
1,Visiting from out of town and this place was a great start to the trip. Employees were very friendly and helpful.  The food was great! The greek salad was sooo great and the dressing on it was awesome.  The hummus and chicken was also wonderful. The spices used on the chicken just made the dish. I like how they make their own sauces.  The touch of dill added to the tzatziki was delicious.  One thing I did not like was how they fried the spinich pie. It tasted too heavy and was super greasy. Totally ruined. Spinach pie is not suppose to feel so heavy when digesting.
0,My vehicle was damaged during the detail....the manager Keith promised to fix the damage-- a lie...the detail was $350   damage $490--  do not risk having my experience at this company.    Dishonest  for responsibility and overpriced for the quality of detail!
0,"The only reason I am giving Quality Suites Pineville 1 star is because the staff at the front desk are nice. If not, I would have not given them a star at all. \nI booked here because the rooms are cheap and it's in a location that is very convenient for me. \nI was on the fourth night of a nine night stay at the hotel. I wake up and feel these bumps on my shoulder as I'm in the shower. When I get out and look in the mirror there is a row of bumps On the back of my right shoulder. I take some pics of them and start \""googling\"". Come to find out that I have been served as an \""All you can eat\"" buffet for Bed Bugs that night. I immediately go to the front desk and demand another room. Honestly, I didn't even want to do that. I wanted out but I read that they can possibly be confined to one room. I go to my new room and now that I'm super paranoid and grossed out, I turn the mattress over and pull out all the sheets. Low and behold another bug sitting on the covers. Bigger, different color, not a bed bug but at this point, there all the same. I took another picture so I'm not made out to be crazy. I storm out of the room and go back to the front desk. After politely informing them of how unsanitary their establishment is, I demand to be checked out. Stuttering in shock, they regretfully complied. I then contacted Hotwire and Quality Suites Corporate office to file formal complaints and demanded remediation for this horrible experience.  \nMoral of the story. Don't stay there (Unless you like bugs!!). I am a very frequent traveler and this is the first time this happened but it causes a big inconvenience. Not only with the hotel but you have to sanitize yourself and every thing you had in the room, even luggage."
0,"If I could give negative stars to this place I would. The chilaquiles were so horrible not only did I not eat them I wouldn't give them to a homeless person. They were cold and soggy. The service was so extremely horrible we waited 30 minutes for our drinks. Our food was cold. We came on New Year's Day for brunch, it was not overcrowded and this will defiantly be the last time ever!"
1,"Best gym in Vegas! Bodysport has the best INDOOR boot camp. Huge facility with awesome trainers. Lots of private trainers bring their clients to Bodysport too. the Revolution circuit training classes are my favorite. Working out with these guys is always fun and challenging. I HIGHLY recommend training, taking a class or just coming here to get your workout on. They have a kids room hangout too I have been working out there since January and absolutely love it. No more LVAC for me..."
1,Great service. Fanny did a great job on my hair and gave me great tips on how to keep my hair healthy. Great experience will keep on going back for my haircuts!!
0,"Thought I would try Qdoba as the interior of the restaurant looked like Chipotle. I brought the 3 tacos home only to find subpar chicken and old rice. The corn salsa had a good taste and kick, but hardly medium spice I was hoping for. \n\nStaff seemed okay."
0,"We walked out of our B gate, searching for a beer. We took a right and it wasn't long before we ran straight into FOX sports SKY \""lounge\"". We were so excited. We approached the bar and we were greeted with a frown from the male bartender. He stood and tapped his fingers impatiently as we set down our bags. My mother asked, \""are you waiting on us?\"" He threw some napkins at us and said, \""yeah just tell me when you're ready\"". Ugh. I didn't want to be here any longer but figured that we could \""turn his frown upside-down\"" somehow. Nope, wrong! We ordered out beers, they only had 4 to choose from. Ugh. We decided to close out even though we had an hour to kill. But we no longer wanted to be in his presence. He continued to saunter around in his Depressing mood. For my Shocktop Belgian Wheat, guess what the price was? $10.17. Lol. A few chairs down from me, a man received his bill. To his dismay it came to $125.23. He got out of his chair and calmly questioned the bartender about the amount. The bartender barked, \""we'll come look at the screen yourself!\"" The poor guy didnt realize that it was $10 a beer and on top of that he had ordered a sandwich, chips, and some bottled drinks for his trip. The bartender was indifferent and insensitive. So the man said, \""wow! I didn't realize it was this price! I mean, I have the money but this is highway robbery.\"" The bartender just scoffed. Ugh. My mother and I each left $1 and even THAT was too much!"
1,Can't beat their lunch and happy hour specials! Great sushi and great prices! Definitely one of my local favorites!
0,"Beer was good but the food was cold. I'm not one to complain but cold food is turn off. They re made both plates which I appreciate, but my husband finished eating his before mine showed up. Annoying. With so many great places in Montreal, we will not be going back"
0,We had a group of at least 30. Most of us (couples) had resort credit. First they told us they couldn't accommodate the separate bills until we complained. Two patrons NEVER got their meal. Crap. Py.. Some people paid before others got their food. L.A.M.E.
0,"had a burger from here on a pretzel bun.... it tasted like an over cooked hockey puck... the fries here tasted like deep fried potatoes.... they kept playing \""red solo cup\"" on the juke box, it was funny the first 30 seconds into it, but the 4 time i heard it i felt like cramming a a red hot steak knife into my ear drum.  I probably should have."
0,"I came here yesterday and was very disappointed with the service. I don't eat meat but it's usually not hard for me to order something without meat and still enjoy/fill me up especially at an Asian restaurant. I couldn't really find anything on the menu so I just ended up ordering \""Goldilocks style spaghetti\"" not really expecting to it be any different. I asked for no meat in my sauce and the waiter told me it would be ok. I also asked about the boba and he didn't tell me the flavors, he said they have a purple and green kind. I understand this is an Asian restaurant and it's hard to communicate with costumers but I am familiar with Boba in the first place so he could just said the flavors instead of colors, I'm not stupid. After waiting around for 15 minutes for the boba it still didn't come out. So I asked another waitress (the waiter who helped me wasn't around) explaining the boba I got and was just wondering where it was. She replied with, \""I don't know\"" I'm pretty sure that's not how you answer a customer. A few minutes later she brought it out. She didn't seem too happy either. I was pleasantly surprised with my \""Green boba\"". Finally my meal came out. There was no sauce on the noodles? I was confused because the waiter said he could get me sauce without the meat and then told me he couldn't after he brought the meal out. If he would have just said that before I order I could have just left the restaurant without being upset. Being a Vegetarian I understand it's difficult to go out to restaurants. He then brought me a bowl of the sauce and said there is meat in and that I would have to scoop it out. It sort of bothered me but at this point I was just ready to leave. I still don't understand why they couldn't just prepare sauce without meat for me. The garlic bread tasted like toast and nothing like garlic bread. Again I wasn't expecting much considering I was ordering this from an Asian restaurant, but it seemed they put little effort into it. I give this place one star because I had horrible customer service and couldn't really enjoy my meal because of it. My Dad really enjoyed his meal (I think he got BBQ pork) but complained it made him feel sick later that night. I would like to go back to try to only to try the bakery part of the restaurant hopefully It will be a better experience for me."
0,"WARNING!!! ATTENTION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS!!! SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! CHOSE DIFFERENT HOTEL!!!\nIf someone has extension of the passport, please stay at any other hotel but this. My entire family was treated by staff very rude. I was told that US laws are not applicable in this hotel. And even if you have valid extended passport with valid US visa you are not allowed to play or be near gambling area. It was such a disappointment after paying thousands of dollars for the flight and hotel ( where at the check in they accepted same passport with no problem). \nWhen we tried to resolve this Security employee treated us the way that no one deserves to be treated. Throwing our document... I have never had this kind of attitude in my life anywhere in The world.\nIf there is a way to submit negative review- this is for this hotel."
0,"I'd give it a negative one star, but that would still be too good a review for this dump. Said they could accommodate a party of 9. Gathered our whole family into two cars including my 93 year old Grandma and a 10 and 7 year old, drove all the way there, and rudely stated they couldn't seat us. It smelled like dead rodents, anyway. I've worked in a lot of restaurants and the stink of dead rodents is never a good sign, obv.  the staff LITERALLY cursed at us - why are they renovating? Just demolish it. Gross."
1,"typically i'm not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits.  However, the Heard experience was beyond expectations.   The 7.50 student price was reasonable and we were instantly put on a walking tour around the museum. The guides were excellent and the museum is quite historic.   \n\nThe contemporary art pieces are not quite art museum worthy.  However the katina doll collection was awesome.  They have Barry Goldwater's personal collection of Katina dolls on display !    I highly suggest using the guided tours,  because some of the exhibits are difficult to process."
1,"Best banh mi's in Phoenix metro! Pretty cheap too! The French bread, liver paste and fillings make this an all-around great Viet sandwich!\n\nThey do Euro deli's too, but it's more worth it to come for the Viet sandwiches.  It's a clean and spacious place.  Most people order to go.  They also serve other Viet snacks and drinks too!\n\nCome try if you have not!"
1,"Fun and flirty, this Cirque show has evolved quite a bit over the years.  I got a package deal from New York, New York, that included two tickets, a fifty dollar dinner credit, two drinks from the Cirque Lounge,and a souvenir program.  The program is an art work in itself, and commmemorates this funny frolic.   Great seats in the front balcony.\nThe acrobatic dance is sensual and mysterious and the champagne glass bath is classic.  Raunchy jokes and visual puns keep up the humor, and the show delivers that certain Cirque allure."
1,Great experience and so much fun. I loved getting to see everything I wanted to order. The round colorful plates made it easy to pick out what I wanted. I love that a sushi roll I wanted but didn't see was easy to request from the chefs. Great place for ladies not outs and great variety of sushi.
1,"Really great food - flavor, spice, everything.  At first I was unsure about the price, but  the value is great: a ton of food, enough to share and for leftovers. Everyone that worked there was so nice and courteous. We'll definitely be back!"
0,"I am writing this to comment on the delivery driver at this location. A driver  was driving ridiculously erratic \nWhile I was driving home (I live about 100 yards from this location) a car began riding dangerously close to me, in my review i noticed they had a pizza delivery sign on top for hungry howies. They were obviously on there way back to the store (so not rushing a pizza to someone)  and they began swapping lanes and riding everyones tale (there was plenty of traffic but it was moving at the speed limit). The driver passed me and made some very dangerous lane changes almost hitting (and definitely angering many other drivers).\nI did not try to keep up with the driver (because of their dangerous speed and illegal maneuvers), but since it is literally beside my home, I drove by the hungry howies and sure enough that persons car was there. \nIt's just ridiculous for someone who is driving for a business and representing that business to drive in that manner. For that reason I will not eat here."
1,"I've eaten at this place many times and I've always enjoyed the food and the service. We usually have delivery from this place and it has always been fresh, hot and has came to our house in a timely manner. I don't think I've ever experienced a problem with is location."
0,The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away.
0,"I just got back from my first visit to DLUX.  The space was great.  The fries were great.  The milkshakes were incredible. The service was on point.  The prices were more than reasonable.\n\nSo why two stars?  For the little box on the menu that says \""the rules.\""  The first two rules are: \""Our burgers are pressed and cooked to the same temperature\"" and \""Feel free to ditch toppings, but no substitutions please.\""\n\nThis says a few things to me:\n\n1) We press our burgers, even though everyone who makes decent burgers knows that they should be loosely packed. We do this so that they'll cook a little faster even though it will hurt the taste.\n\n2) We are going to cook our pressed little patties of meat into charred pucks that are grey throughout.  Do you like your burger rare and juicy? We don't care.  We could take it off the grill a few minutes sooner like literally thousands of other restaurants are capable of doing, but for some reason we won't.  \n\nSeriously, this crap tries my patience at Five Guys, and that's a fast food place.\n\n3) Do you see some ingredients on our menu that you'd look to add to your burger? Screw you.  We won't do it.  Yes, we have caramelized onions right in the kitchen, but we refuse to put them on your burger, since that would be a substitution.\n\n4) Our customers  have asked us to cook their burger to a different temperature or to tweak the toppings.  Instead of figuring out how to satisfy those customers, we decided to put this notice on our menu to warn people that we have no intention of doing things that are entirely within our power to do in order to give them a good experience.\n\n\nAnd guess what? The burger is crappy.  It's an overcooked, dried out little mess, which is a pity, since the non-meat components seemed to be high quality.  It was far from the worst thing I've ever eaten, but nothing to write home about.\n\n\nI'd definitely appreciate a response from a manager explaining why you refuse to cook burgers to the temperature that people want to eat them at.  If you're willing to cook me a rare burger I'll gladly come back and pay full price.  If not, I'll be skipping this place.\n\nEdit: After some research, I've learned that one reason restaurants do this is because they don't grind meat in house, like all decent burger places do. That doesn't make it better, DLUX. Why are you making \""upscale\"" burgers with pre-ground meat?"
0,"Dr. Day convinced me to extract 4 perfectly healthy bicuspids in order alleviate crowding. Almost immediately, I began to notice significant facial changes. My face thinned out tremendously. My cheekbones became sallow, my lips thinned and my facial skin began to sag. I was only 28 years old at the time. My family and friends all noticed as well.  This was the biggest mistake of my life. I should have done my research! There is extensive research available about the adverse effects of tooth extraction on facial aesthetics.   \n\nThis is basically an irreversible decision, and it would have been nice to have some sort of warning about the possibility of facial changes. As well, alternatives to bicuspid removal should have been presented to me.   Extraction for orthodontic treatment is a very 'old fashion' practice and I am thoroughly disappointed in the outcome. I am now spending countless hours researching ways to reverse the effects of Dr. Day's laziness.   Please do your research and find another orthodontist who is willing to put in the work for a better outcome. You will be glad you did."
1,I'm a regular. Great espresso and lattes. Great bakery. Pretty good smoothies (nothing to write home about but definitely worth trying). Great breakfast wraps (get the salsa!) and lunch sandwiches. Not a fan of their brewed or pour-over coffee.\n\nBaristas are all super friendly. Nice indoor patio (with removable windows) and outdoor seating.\n\nSlow/spotty wifi but lots of plugs.
0,"So I've heard everyone rave about this place but every time we've come here, there is always at least an hour wait. So we decided to come early today to avoid a wait...only to be told that they do not do outdoor seating or takeout on the weekends (our dog was with us and we were not going to leave him in the car). We tried to be flexible but it was like they didn't care for our business...looks like it was never meant to be. They didn't even try to offer an explanation for their policy. Don't think I'll try to eat here again...not worth paying $16 for a pizza when the service is not worth it!"
1,"Outstanding customer service,friendly and knowledgeable staff,best prices around.\nIf you shop elsewhere,you are a bad person,and should feel bad."
1,I wanted to dine here before it closed and boy was it good!  To start we both got cocktails from the bar which were fabulous and the service at the bar was top notch.  We then sat down and were greeted by a server who had asked if we would like bottled water or tap and we said bottled and then the brought tap anyway.  (Oh Well!).  For appetizers we ordered the lobster rolls which was TO DIE FOR.  Hands down one of the best things I've ever had.  We also had the tuna tartare which was OK.  I'm never a big fan of Tuna Tartare.  \n\nFor entrees I got the filet mignon which was good except it didn't come with any fancy sauces and I'm a big sauce person.  My friend got the salmon which she loved.  She also got the greens salad and said it was good.\n\nFor a side we got the lobster whipped potatoes which was more like cream of wheat when talking consistency... Not so good.  I was really looking forward to these but i would recommend passing next time.\n\nOverall the experience was great.  We loved the ambience and are excited to dine at the French Michael Mina restaurant in the winter!
0,"I have come here a couple times because I love the layout for working... Good table space, good wifi, and decent coffee.. a good place to meet people to work too. \n\nBut holy crap, who are they hiring? There is one girl here who constantly is cursing at absurd volume levels and doesn't stop complaining about everything. The others don't do anything during the slow parts of the day other than \""hang out\"" and talk loudly about their lives, sometimes complaining about work. (They could use that time to clean up a bit, there are dust bunnies everywhere and pretty close to food/drink.) They also seem to use the coffee shop as a place to play their own music, which is usually really loud metal or rock.  \n\nThis place is really dropping on my scale of places to work. Too bad, the good qualities are just being squashed by the people working here."
1,"We had to rush in and rush out. So we got what we wanted. Great service, great menu, and accommodating. Having only been here once so far, we'll go again."
0,"Guys I've got a great idea. Trust me you'll love it. What we'll do is, we'll take an ordinary decent shirt that most people would be happy to wear and put a massive, horrible design on the back that makes no one want it! Sounds great, I have an idea too - Do you like this cardigan? Sure you do, but you'd like it a whole lot better if I sewed half a hoody into it wouldn't you?\n\nI don't get this place at all. They seemed to take perfectly reasonable clothes and ruin them. I mean, they're truly horrible clothes. I'm reviewing this River Island in particular because not only are the clothes horrible in here, but the staff are horrible and the rubbish they sell is really disorganised and scattered all over the floor. I can't see a reason for ever buying clothes from there. Maybe I'm just too old fashioned."
0,"Had a \""company\"" meal here. The foot was decent but I would not say outstanding. The chicken dela casa OK, the asparagus was cooked about perfectly but the dinner salad was pretty boring. --just lettuce and tomato, nothing else. The dressing was pretty bland too. I don't think I would return on purpose. The only really positive things I can say are 1. I did not have to pay because I was on company business and 2. It was better than Olive Garden"
0,Yay. Cafeteria food. Yay.
1,"A great local coffee, beer and wine cafe that is owned by Catholic Charities, so patronizing this establishment supports local refugee programs. Local art, jewelry and crafts done by refugees are also featured and available to purchase. \n\nThe atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. The coffee and teas are outstanding and are roasted/made right here in Phoenix. The food is sourced with local ingredients and made fresh. I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich and the the tuna sandwich. The fresh salsa and chips and salad are both tasty side options. Actually, everything I have eaten here has been good! \n\nThey have a nice private meeting room in back and right now they have a local \""Promote Your Talent Showcase\"" the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month featuring various local musicians and vocalists in an intimate setting. \n\nI suggest that you stop by and try out this great new establishment that is focused on supporting local community."
1,"Pretty surprising for a sports bar. Excellent variety, higher end quality and consistency with everything we've tried here! Even their steamed veggies are amazing. Try their honey medium spicy wings! Bomb! Great service and drinks."
0,"Came to stay here  at a great group rate to wake up to blood stained sheets. So disappointed and disgusted. We had a room with double beds since I slept with our baby on one bed and hubby had the other bed.  Woke up to find the sheet above the fitted sheet had blood stains.  I thought mabey the hubby must have scratched hsi leg or something while sleeping and woke him up to find it was not his. NASTY!  1)how does the housekeepers place sheets on there knowing and seeing or do they even change the sheets. It was the coversheet above the bottom fitted sheet. Complained to front desk (Claudia) at 7stars she just called housekeeping and apologized (I think)... I didn't hear the actual \""im sorry\"" but she knew it was wrong.  1 star raiting because there is no lesser option.  We didn't complain to get compensated but NEVER again will we EVER stay here or reccomend it for that matter! DISGUSTED!!"
0,"Eh... the food was good but not something I'd crave?  I had a chicken/swiss panini that evidently came with corn on it?\n\nEDIT: (actually it was the Adobe Panini: \""Mesquite turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo\"".  I got called out that there wasn't anything on the menu I said I ate, got it a little wrong but the review remains the same regardless. Here you go Bob M.)\n\nSlightly surprised on it but, can't complain... it was good but nothing great.\n\nThey have subs and soups too - I'd go there again if friends were already going but def not somewhere I'd really mention when trying to think of somewhere to eat."
1,"My family has been using Dr. Burke for our pets since I was to young to remember. He has a great personality, is very knowledgeable and is great with the pets! His prices are fair and you can usually get an appointment within a week or sooner for emergencies. The offices are always clean, bright and the front desk staff is very friendly. We have brought Dogs, Cats and Birds to Dr. Burke."
1,"I love Red Square and go there every time I go to Vegas. The attention to detail that went into designing this place is quite impressive. The decor is fashioned after and inspired by communist-era Russia and the bar is made out of dry ice. I have only consumed various vodka drinks here so cannot attest to the food, but they have an extensive caviar selection to pair with their vodka selection, which is vast. I usually get a straight, dry martini with some kind of high end russian vodka. This comes ice cold with a blue cheese stuffed olive at the bottom, soaking up all the booze. I have yet to do the vodka flight inside the subzero vodka freezer but that will be next on the agenda."
0,Omg....terrible place for frozen yogurt!!!   I would not recommend this place at all!!!
0,"The service here on a Saturday morning was ridiculously slow.  We were seated and it then took 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our order.  Even then, the waitress only initially took our drinks orders until we summoned her back to take the food order as well.  Oddly enough, 15 minutes was just right to decide what we wanted.\n\nThe coffee kept coming reasonably regularly but the food took another 45 minutes to appear, which is just amazing.  It's diner food not gourmet a la carte.  The food wasn't bad though, although I would have liked my Corned Beef Hash to be a bit bigger.  It felt like someone was trying to dress it up as a fancy new style, when it should just have been served in the classic way.\n\nCan't really recommend this place but I can see the appeal of diner food 24 hours a day.  If only they can improve the service."
1,Love this place! I had a Ruben and my husband had the signature roasted turkey and stuffing sandwich. Food was EXCELLENT ! ! Mac and cheese was nice and hot and the orzo salad was seasoned perfectly. Only reason that my rating is not 5 stars is because of the clunking noise coming from the beverage cooler. Very annoying. Don't pass this place up if you're in the area. Will definitely be heading back soon!
1,"They know how to treat you here.  Everything is top-notch. Excellent martinis, steaks, and sides (generous enough to share with several people).  For our special occasion, they threw in free desserts."
1,"Great dinner.  Went last night, food was great, wine was great, service was excellent and attentive.  Ambiance was perfect for our dinner party of 4.  Everyone enjoyed it."
0,"I've used Recon's services four times.  Their real challenge is consistency.  Some of the services were awesome for the price, while others left me completely disappointed.  I get the impression that other than owner Dave, Recon is a revolving door for techs - some good and some weak.  And while Recon is not the best at proactive communication, Dave almost always answers his phone or returns your call promptly.\n\nMy first visit was to repair a bumper and grill on my Altima (Teenager 1).  I ordered the replacement parts myself and took them to Recon for matching paint before installing them myself.  Very inexpensive and the paint match was excellent.  I was very satisfied.  \n\nI then had Recon tech \""Evo\"" come to my home for paintless dent repair on my Honda Accord Coupe.  I was totally impressed by Evo's service and the results he achieved.  In just a few hours, he removed a decade's worth of dings and dents for less than $150.\n\nBased on two positive outcomes, I had Recon work on my Honda Accord after I got rear-ended.  The experience was spotty.  When I went to pick it up there were conspicuous paint drips.  The tech agreed to try again, but I was disappointed to have my time wasted.  Two days later, I picked it up with no complaints - the paint matched well and the drips had been corrected.  About a week later, however, the cosmetic lip on the bumper sagged off when the adhesive separated on a hot day.  Recon's Dave said to bring it back, but I fixed that myself out of convenience.  Still satisfied and still willing to do business here at that point.\n\nMy last visit (ever) to Recon (Nov 13) was to repair a bumper and a door on the Altima (Teenager 2).  Recon Tech Erick gave me a quote of $400 and said it would take two days.  Apparently, Erick flew the coop a few days later and stranded my unfinished car.  After reconnecting with Dave, Recon's owner, I finally get my car back after nine days.  I pick up just after sundown in a poorly lighted parking lot.  The car is filthy and so I take Dave's word that everything is A-OK and pay him in cash.  The next day, I discover my metallic gray car has a somewhat purple-colored door with an uneven finish and there's a lacquer-like product splattered on the windows and one of the undamaged doors.  I return to Recon where Dave literally says \""Erick did an awful job,\"" but he denies that the lacquer-ish stuff is from them.  In short, Dave says Erick screwed him over and he can't afford to repair the poor workmanship properly.  So much for Recon's satisfaction guarantee.   Considering I was a repeat customer, I was completely shocked.\n\nIn closing, they are capable of doing a decent job at a great price, but they are also capable of doing awful work and failing to stand behind it.  If your budget is limited and you're willing to roll the dice, this may be your place."
0,"Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830. \nMy experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1.\nNext our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead.\nLissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3.\nMy companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4.\nMy tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5.\nNext up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6.\nNot even done yet......\nAt 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes \""when the party is over.\""  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7.\nShe finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting.\nAt 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8. \n I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9\nWhen Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10.\nFurthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, \""Ok they took a dollar off.\""  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11.\nI am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back."
0,"Taste: 2.5\nCreativity/Authenticity: 3.5\nAtmosphere: 3\nService: 4\nBang for your buck: 3\n\nthe only thing me and my gf argue about is food, and when in vegas you have a lot of options and this time we were starving after partying all night till 9 am we needed some food and well we should have argued some more but this time we both said F@#k it and lets eat at the palms cause the reviews seem good... in my drunken state i swore i ate at the palms before and it sucked but i wasn't sure well it sucked again. The service here is good at least with our server, but looking around at the faces of these waiters they look miserable, fake smile on their face when theres a customer which was a bad sign to come. The food here well was just blah, got the boggi burger and the lobster blt. The burger was dry and burnt, the lobster blt was good but nothing special about it just another sandwich with lobster. Atmosphere seems great but it was dead so the ambiance wasn't what i believed or have heard the palms to be. price wise wasn't too bad but when you get more into steaks the price will go up. Overall i don't plan on coming back just because there are so many more choices in Vegas"
1,"Totally enjoyable, every person that I have taken here is forever a fan of Honey Pig!\n\nThe Beef Brisket and Bulgogi are sooooooooooooo good!!!"
0,"Came here with high expectations after going to Drai's the day before and having a blast. To be honest, I was a little underwhelmed. I felt like the energy just wasn't as high at Encore and it was more like fancy hotel pool instead of a pool party. A lot of the girls here are super fake (a few friends and I actually made a game of pointing out all the fake boobs), but some people are into that so to each their own. I wish there were more dancing areas with ankle deep water so you didn't either bake or turn all pruney. Drinks are expensive as usual - going rate is about $19. \n\nPros: \n-Good music. \n-Good looking guys and gals. \n-Poolside couches/cabanas are well placed (though absurdly priced.) \n-Large pool space.\n-Decently priced lockers. \n\nCons: \n-No shade (you will buuuuurn) in the pool. \n-There is NO splashing. Security is 100% on top of that. \n-ABSOLUTELY NO dudes on that middle dance area with the stripper poles. You will be bounced in under 15 seconds guaranteed. And leads me to another point. \n-Security are Nazis here. \n-Water costs $11 (so ask for a glass of ice instead). \n-Sunscreen costs $30\n-Pool water gets really gross really fast. The water was murky when we left after 2 hours. Also there was an assortment of floating straws, cups, and bottles. Ew."
0,"PF is probably one of my favorite restaurants out there. For one, they offer a nice gluten free menu and the food is always great. I have eaten at MANY different locations. We have many lunch meetings for work and take our clients to PF Changs all of the time. It has always been the one restaurant to never disappoint me. Well until now. Me and my family recently moved and this is the closest location to us. I will never eat here again! The service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress skipped over us, our food took over an hour with the excuse that gluten free entrees take longer. Yea well not at any of the other locations. The food tasted great as always but I would way rather take the drive to another location to get better and faster service. Especially with hungry little ones. Never again."
1,"Yellow chicken curry was sweet and delicious! Boyfriend got the green curry with beef-also amazing. Authentic Thai flavor sand spices. Service was pleasant and atmosphere was clean and fresh. Dishes were served in a timely manner and displayed beautifully. Appreciated that the \""spice levels\"" were accurate-I always have to order on the hotter side, but medium was perfect. Around $10 per plate, but portions and taste were well worth the price!"
1,"Bonfire seemed like a new place. I liked the aroma emanating from the place one night and my boss and I went there for lunch.  I was surprised that we were the only ones in there. Not a good sign. But there is a lot of competition as plenty of good eateries are concentrated in Old Town Scottsdale. The decor is dark and very wooden -- reminded a bit of an hipster version of Stuart Anderson's Black Angus. A couple of TVs played college football games. The music was Country and Western (Yawn).\n\nI ordered a spare ribs appetizer and a caesar salad. The salad was good. The ribs were great. They were fall-off-the-bone tender and had a wonderful sauce that was just perfect. Dollops of bleu cheese on the ribs was a surprisingly good complement to the succulent meat. The portion was entree sized too.  My boss was ecstatic about his dish as well.\n\nAfter the meal, we talked to the manager and asked him why more people weren't here. He said that they do incredible business at night. I also commented that he might want to lose the country music. \n\nI returned for dinner a few weeks later.  I ordered the ribs again, with grilled corn on the cob.  The ribs were again enjoyable, but the recipe seemed a bit different with more chipotle spice added.  The corn was very tender and tasty.\n\nMy very attractive server was also the daughter of the owner.  She told me they have only been in  business for 6 months or so.  It also seemed that they changed the music to a more modern, eclectic vibe."
1,Their 'shrimp & scallops Antoinette' (with white wine & artichoke hearts) was delicious!
1,Service is fast and Very good food. Worth the wait!
1,Dr. Stansberry is a wonderful dentist. He does great work and really cares about his patients. His staff is always friendly and helpful and I would recommend his services to anyone.
0,Very so so burgers. Best to head elsewhere for a burger. Lots of other options. Limited options. Service could easily be improved. Once at this place was enough. I won't be back
1,"Changing my review! The very same day I posted my review, the owner contacted me to apology and offered me a mani pedi service by him. Very professional, and very pleasant. Will definitely be taking him up on this offer! Very pleased."
0,"Never order Mexican with a slick facade.  Anyplace in a strip mall with Grandma back in the kitchen usually yields the gold.  This place, all hipster glitter and low rider bikes, needs to spend less time with the chrome and more time with the food.  I was underwhelmed by everything on the menu, even the guava Margarita.  Will not be going back."
0,"This company has terrible customer service.  I contacted them about a repair that they had a warranty on.  The warranty was for 1 year.  The part broke after 8.5 months and they refuse to even discuss it with me.  The woman on the phone yelled at me like I was an idiot and said that since I called another repair company to fix it, they wouldn't warranty their work.  At the time my ceiling had water pouring down so I needed to get it fixed ASAP.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
0,"Went to this place when we visited Vegas for a wedding.. I love the show so I figured the 2.5 hour line was worth it... We'll, not so much. \nWhile I must admit the selection and display is beautiful, I wasn't blown away by the taste of their product. My cannoli cream was gritty and the shell wasn't very crisp by time I got to eat it. My fudge cupcake- frosting was okay but I myself make better.. And finally, I got this cake thing- it was white chocolate mousse covered with chocolate. The mousse was WAY!! To sweet, and I wish the chocolate shell would have had a crunch to it.\nI know I bought some other items too, but overall I wasn't too empresses.. Waiting 2.5 hours and paying about $30 for something that I could make or buy in Wisconsin tasting better and cheaper than this place, why'd I even come?? Should have listened to my mom and just taken the picture outside and gotten desserts someplace else.."
1,"have a drink with john the bartender before dinner.\n\nif you can't score a table then enjoy a fun dinner at the circular bar.\nthe bartender is some sparkly and beautiful girl who dangerously plys you with their signature espresso shots.  you'll often see jesse the stylish gm making the rounds.  \n\nthe garbage salad is popular with the ladies but who said i was one?\nheh heh.  so we opted for the sashimi n9ne.  big eye tuna, salmon and hamachi.  \n\nfollowed with the surf and turf - a filet mignon and lobster special with white truffle aioli and a red wine sauce.  we played \""healthy\"" and added in the grilled asparagus.  gotta have your veggies.\n\nand of course, save room for dessert since you'll be dancing it off at the club afterwards anyways.  i know we did!"
0,"The food was good , the service not so good, it was less than desirable. .I'm all about getting good service. .. I will not be returning."
1,"Rating this as an \""American (new)\""/bar-grill sort of place, then definitely 5 stars.\n\nFood: well-prepared, and good diversity on the menu without being \""and the kitchen sink.\"" I liked that they had rotational items throughout the week, too (I think meatloaf was the night we went) along with chef specials. I went with the night's special of filet with crab, and it was very good.  They even have raw oysters, which were cleaned and prepared very nicely (it's funny, it always seems to me that the fancier seafood-focused places are where they leave them gritty, and places like this place just get them right).\n\nEnvironment:  Cool vibe, energetic, and well-done lighting/decor. \n\nService: Special kudos on this front. The servers seemed to really know their stuff, had thoughtful explanations/recommendations, and were knowledgeable about the food they were serving. It appears that management here cares that their staff know what they're selling/serving, so this shows, and they seemed genuinely interested in our experience.\n\nTip: I'd recommend a reservation, even if you're just reading this and about to walk over from a local hotel. They were fairly busy, and we were a group of five. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table (no problem), but they did ask if we had a reservation when we arrived. But I also don't think it's a problem if you don't have one, just FYI for those that are able.\n\nOpportunity for improvement: I really wish they'd list the abv on their beer listings! With more craft brews and focus on IPA-styles, some can start to get high, so it'd be nice to see at a glance to help plan if 2 or 3 is going to be too many for some. \n\nThanks!"
1,"The Pizza is phenomenal.  I am all about the Funky Q Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas.\n\nIt's strange to be here because in VA, Mellow Mushroom is part of the college scene.  This one is a more cut-and-dry, well-maintained, family-friendly version.\n\nIt is really loud in the evenings (as they blast music at the bar), so try to be far away or if it's not too hot try to get outside, otherwise you're shouting to be heard."
0,"My wife and son purchased 4 different cupcakes as a surprise and they ate two of them and both ended up throwing up that night.  We'll NEVER go back.  They are not very good anyway, they have way too much icing and not enough cupcake."
1,"This lounge is in the center of the vortex of the tornado of Planet Hollywood and the swirling winds of the city of sin that surrounds it.  And like Dorothy before me, once I was sucked in, the world became a magical place, where I was surrounded by strange creatures in technicolor.  Or just some people in ridiculous outfits.  \n\nHeart is really quite unremarkable, which, in Las Vegas, is quite remarkable.  Having less blinking lights and commotion than the chaos surrounding it makes it, quite literally, easy on the eyes.\n\nHaving lost my bearings and Auntie Em in the howling tempest  of insanity outside, I would end up here at the end of the night to seek some modicum of solace, regain my composure, count my losses, and have decent conversation with friends, and other patrons, who too, sought shelter from the storm."
1,"I love Fry Bread!!  But my big belly doesn't let me indulge as much as I would like!!  Occasionally when I get the hankering, this is the place!!\n\nI really enjoy their chile toppings, either red or green with all the fixins!  Just really good traditional food made by authentically traditional ladies in the back!   Yes, ladies you rock!!!"
0,"What a joke! If this is a technology company someone should tell your 19th century employees. Can't find accounts, shitty service. It's as if they are still in high school hanging out and we the customers are interrupting.  Go ahead blame your demise on Amazon while giving scrappy service.."
1,"This location is consistently busy. If big sales are on, I wouldn't even bother trying unless you are prepared for war with moms and toddlers. The selection here is usually good and shelves seem well stocked."
1,Great burgers very fresh great toppings and a awesome price  very and clean inside and the service very quick
1,"This isn't my first choice of hotels in vegas, but for the right price, it's my second or third....\n\nGood:\nPools - amazing - lots of them, plenty of seats and a lazy river.\nLots of bars and restaurants - Wichcraft was nice and loved the convenience of McDonalds in the food Court\nThe Front Desk Manager - did a great job\n\nBAD:\nThe rooms are definitely worn - the light was out in our bathroom - they did quickly change it.\nPlumbing was weird - strange noises and slow drains\n\nMake sure you text to the \""Offers\"" number they display all over the property - you get 2 for 1 drinks, etc.\n\nNot my style, but what might work for some is the all you can eat all day buffett offers - 29 bucks during the week - 40 I think on the weekends.\n\nHave fun!"
1,"I found Jayeness (Jim Moloney) when searching for someone to remove the 1980's acoustic popcorn from the 18 foot vaulted ceilings in my newly purchased house.  He was fantastic to work with, well priced, and works to please.  Jim has been in the business for over 20 years, and really takes pride in what he does.  Jim likes to play with color in homes and gave us some color choosing advice, which I very much appreciated.  He always showed up early, worked very efficiently, is very detail oriented, and cleaned up well after he finished the job.  If I were to have more rooms in the house (or the outside) painted, I would definitely hire him again!"
0,"Girlfriend and I decided to enjoy a staycation by the pool with some recent time-off.  Chose the resort on a whim based on a mental image of drinking cocktails while floating down a lazy river... should have done some research prior to booking.\n\nHotel grounds are dated and reminded me a of a 1980s apt community.  None of the pool side bars were open.. may have just been an off day.  Sauna/steam room out of order, not to mention the elevator to our floor during part of the stay.\n\nI will say the water park area was respectable, I could see the appeal for families.\n\nLike I said, should have done my research...  not a good fit for what I was looking for but might fit a niche for some people."
0,"Very disappointed!  Stayed here for one night 4/12-13. Originally I called before booking our room to make sure there was a shuttle to and from the strip. The only reason we booked with this hotel is because they said they had a shuttle. The person at the front desk told us it was a different Marriott, then why does the number I called about the shuttle match my confirmation print out? I've never had a problem with Marriott but the man at the front desk was very rude and didn't smile not once even when we approached the front desk with smiles on our faces. It's worth the extra $20 to get a room on the strip so you don't have to pay $40 just to get to the New York round trip."
1,"Met a friend for brunch there this morning; we were a little on the early side for a Saturday morning, arriving about 9:30.  By the time we left, the place was full and there was a wait at the counter.  \n\nI had coffee and the biscuits/gravy with eggs and field greens for $10.95, my friend ordered the breakfast sandwich for $5.95.  Frankly, my meal was overpriced, and wasn't of sufficiently higher quality to justify the additional charge over, say, Denny's.  I'm not opposed to paying for atmosphere or creative and fresh cooking; this just wasn't special enough, IMO.  My friend's sandwich, on the other hand, was tremendous- on ciabatta with eggs, tomato, applewood bacon, etc.  I'd definitely order that again.\n\nIt's great that they serve Ancora coffee- a definite plus in my book.  It's family-friendly, but the kids there were generally well-behaved- also another plus.  Didn't feel rushed and the decor is comfortable."
0,"For the price they set on, the foods are joking, sushi price is so dry, it's not sticky.  The hamachi sushi is at the low quality side.  The Fusion sushi are worth to try, but not the authentic ones."
1,"This place has a cute atmosphere with nice wall decors and Hawaiian music.  The staff were mellow.  The red velvet pancakes were really delicious - not too sweet,  not too thick,  chocolate powder layered over, nice light fluffy whipped cream, and sweet sugar glazed syrup.  I had side fruits - too much mushy cantaloupe.  I am looking forward to come back to try other things."
0,My daughter hurt her knee playing sports and was limping so I called to see until how late they were open. I was told they would take patients until 6:45 pm so I rushed over to get my daughters knee checked. I showed up and was told that no sorry they wouldn't be able to see her after all because they just got five patients in. You think they would honor the fact they told you they would take patients until a certain time. The MA apologized and said he doesn't like to turn patients away but it would take at least a half hour to fire up the X-ray machine and get my daughters visit done and he would like to get home at a decent time. I guess my daughters injury wasn't worth firing up the X-ray machine! He then recommended us to an urgent care down the street. So thank your employee Express Urgent Care because someone else just got your business and will continue to get it from now on so your employees can get home at a decent time. So if anyone has an URGENT visit this is not the place to go to. They should change their name!
0,"My wife and I didn't have the best of Labor Day week ends. First her car over heats Saturday night and we have drop it off at a garage for repair. She borrows my car which decides to shred its back tire Sunday night during a raging thunderstorm and no one open to fix it because its a holiday week end,so we are now without a vehicle.\nMy wife reserves a car on line and no where on the website does it say you have to have a major credit card to rent car. Our daughter picks us up and we drive 45 minutes to the airport and wait in line only to be told when we present our debit card that we need a major credit card to rent a car. WTF!! A debit card is the same as cash and we are being turned down for a car rental???\nMy wife informed the clerk that she had used this same debit card in other cities to rent car while she was on business trips and at this point he takes a condescending attitude and told us we were not renting a car with a debit card.\nI kept my cool until the clerk starting waving my wife's debit card in our face and treating us like we were white trash because we did not have a credit card.\nAt this point both my wife and I lost it and I profanely told him what I thought of him and Enterprise care rental. My wife snatched her debit card out of his hand and we stormed out mad as hell.\nMy wife and I do not have nor care to have a major credit card. If we can not pay cash for something, we do not buy it.\nI cannot believe in todays world a company will not take a debit card for a purchase.\nIf Enterprise was the last car rental place on the face of the earth and we don't have a car, we will walk rather than rent from them!"
0,"Too expensive for the quality of food served. \n\nWe went to Sunny's Diner for a leisurely sit-down breakfast. It looked to be a fair place owned by a family, and we had hoped to find a good \""hole in the wall\"" place to eat breakfast, rather than our old standby. \n\nI was served my first ever shell in my egg. That's not a deal-breaker but was surprising. In all my years of eating eggs cooked in this fashion I had never crunched into an eggshell fragment while eating. \n\nWe ordered off the \""special\"" menu and believed our dishes were $3.99 each. We added fruit & whipped cream after asking how much fruit came with the $2.50 upgrade price--the waitress told us a large handful of strawberries, a large handful of blueberries, and a whole banana would adorn each of our now-$6.49 meals. \n\nThis was not the case. \n\nAnd our meals were an extra dollar each. When pointing out the price on the menu to the waitress, she said other people had been fooled by that, too, and offered to take the $2 off our bill--and then did not. \n\nAll in all, it comes down to this: I was lied to, misdirected, and given a fraudulent product. And the product itself was so-so, earning a Waffle House 3-star \""meh\"" rating on its own merits. \n\nWe will not be going back. I hope others have better luck at Sunny's Diner than we did."
0,"The last time I ate at Max's was for my sister's graduation back in the Philippines. It's been a while, but my palate have a very good memory. I was so excited to try this place out because it was one of my favorite chain restaurant back home, so I coerced my dad to go here with me after we did some grocery shopping over at Seafood City; We both were highly disappointed with this place. It's nothing like the Max's back home. Ok, maybe their chicken was good but that's about it. We ordered sisig, which turned out to be mediocre, had some lumpiang ubod which tasted fake, and their pancit bihon and the spaghetti that came with my daughter's kid's meal tasted like how instant ramen noodles taste like; My daughter pushed her plate away and said it was yucky and tasted like goop and paste. And the server we had wasn't good as well. I work in the restaurant industry and I always feel bad giving bad tips to servers but I barely wanted to give our server a tip. He was rushing us with our food, was talking to us condescendingly, and was rude and gave us bad attitude when my daughter accidentally spilled her drink on the table, and let me cleaned up after her without even offering me extra napkins or towels to wipe it up. All this happened while the restaurant was almost empty. I'm really disappointed. Hopefully they train their staff better and do something about their food."
0,Went here for work.  Pleasant people aside from maybe a manager who seemed inconvienced.  I needed a vendor to take on $12-15k a year worth of boxed lunches.  I don't think they can handle that volume because the people I dealt with didn't seem ready to talk those figures.  She was in a hurry to tell me what a normal person would pay daily.  Why would I pay regular price for so much?  I've heard the foods decent.  I won't know.  Missed opportunity I think.
0,"The hotel rooms might not be the most modern ones but they're fair for the price you pay. The room has been (mostly) clean and during our stay the location was very quit (which we were looking for). However, the fact that we had to pay an extra fee of $ 13 per day which has not been mentioned before is an unacceptable business practice not to mention the fact of price distortion."
1,"Wave House definitely exceeded my expectations on everything. I'm not a fan of paying ridiculous amounts of money to clean and their prices were just right for my 3,500 sq ft. home and was immaculately cleaned. COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR MORE! \n\nI have vacation rental homes out in Maricopa and will now be having Wave house clean my houses as the week/weekend renters end their stays at my properties. \n\nGreat deals and great cleaning service mixed with great people. Alot of \""greats\"" I know, sorry, haha. \n\nWe will be in contact every time I need you for cleaning services. Thanks once again!"
1,"This is a great alternative to California Pizza Kitchen, the pizzas and salads are very good, they have great variety and great prizes, and the atmosphere is much better. I will  definitely become a regular."
0,"We waited over 15 minutes to get our food! The place was almost empty. When I went to ask why it was taking so long they said it would be right out. The food then came out cold and not very good. The potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce. I wouldn't go back."
1,"So, it was my boyfriends birthday this past weekend, and we decided to do it up Vegas style.  We arrived in Vegas on Friday, and checked into the Palm.  I'll review that in a minute.  Hold your horses.\n\nOn Saturday evening, we went up to Ghost Bar...up, up, up 55 floors!  If you want to go and dance your ass off, this isn't the place for you.  (they actually have a sign 'no dancing', or something like that)  If you want some pretty decent music, chill surroundings, and pretty people to look at.  You've come to the right place.  \n\nIt's much smaller than you'd expect,  but the decor and the vibe is incredible.  \n\nAnd the view!!  It's absolutely incredible.  55 floors over Vegas' bright lights offers more than a view.  This was an experience.  \n\nThe drinks are steep, but nice and strong.  The staff friendly.  The bouncers scary.  The clientele, mostly normal.  I had these 2 'I'm too sexy to button my shirt up because I like to show my hairy chest' guys hitting on me.  With my boyfriend standing right there.  Well, that didn't last long, but besides that, it was a great night!\n\nIf you're visiting Vegas, I highly recommend checking this place out.  Just make sure you've got a few extra $'s to spend!!"
1,"Absolutely LOVE Grapes Wine Bar! You can sit quietly with a glass of wine and read your Kindle while the live music plays Friday and Saturday nights, stop in for Dessert with friends, have a wine tasting with the amazing home made hummus, olive or cheese plate. They have it all and are so genuinely gracious, not to mention its close to home so no need to fight traffic or look for parking. I absolutely recommend the following wine (love Merlot!) if you are going to have any of their dark chocolate cake/desserts: Villa San Juliette, Paso Robles, CA They recommended it and wow did the fruit in the wine PoP! Great choice!"
1,"Ellis island is a hidden gem of Las Vegas. Sure you might pull up and think to yourself, do I really want to go in? And the answer is yes, yes you do. \n\nI have frequented EI for years and I have yet to have a bad experience. The food is always on point. Nothing fancy, just good food at great prices. My favorite items on the menu include the chicken fried chicken, the Caesar salad (homemade dressing), the chicken Parmesan, and the breakfast special. You won't find a more solid place that is open 24 hours a day, especially at that price! You won't be disappointed!"
1,Always good food and service. And at reasonable prices. You just can't go wrong at this restaurant.
0,"The only thing good about the meal was the onion rings.  The french fries where cold when they arrived and the dipping sauces were inedible.  Burger not cooked to desired \""medium well\"".  If burgers are what your do, there really should not be any question about when they are done.  With the number of people they serve in a day they should have a well oiled machine, and they didn't.  Disappointed to say the least"
0,"Ate here during Thanksgiving a couple years back and paid the most money for the least value of any buffet I've been to in Las Vegas.  Food was poorly heated and the sliced roast definitely looked better at the buffet, then when it was sitting on my plate, turning my stomach with it's uneven cooking.  I don't know what happened to these guys since years ago they actuallyed seemed to know what they were doing, but we vowed it would be our last time to eat here.    Expensive too as buffets go (even during a Thanksgiving night)."
1,"Being Italian, its hard to impress and compare too homemade cooking. However the meal here is outstanding!!!!!!!!!!   I would highly highly reccomend, service prefect, and a impeccable restroom.. Our dinner consisted of house salad, the homemaid Papperdale pasta with truffle, scallops and asparugus, a perfectly balanced flavor of all ingredients, followed by the Seabass, and the Tripe which were both tremendous, dishes clean. Like usual problem, no room for desert. The lounge area is very inviting, old school, and relaxing.  Not only will be returning, but cannot wait."
0,"Awful.  Just awful.  Paying this much money to be treated like cattle.  I do not recommend this airline to say the least.  It didn't ruin my trip but just frustrating.  I waited until now, the next morning to finish this.  :|\n\nPart 4: UPDATE: Finally get on plane. Finally depart.  Finally land.  Sit at gate since it's not clear for us to enter for half an hour.  \n\nPart 3 UPDATE:  We board the plane.  We close up the plane, go over safety precautions and exit methods, we clear for departure, and BAM!  It is announced we need to rotate the front tire so we need to depart the plane for a little over an hour while they rotate said tire.  So we de-board, are offered not as far as a FREE WATER or cup of coffee.  Wonderful.\n\nPart 2 UPDATE: Airline changed the gate and didn't tell those of us who had been sitting there for an hour.  Fantastic.  Not a single stewardess or desk attendant in sight.  NO ONE to answer questions!  Or mention that our departure time had been delayed!\n\nPart 1:\nOH, you found a great deal online for Spirit...?\nBEWARE the bait and switch!  \n\nBeware the 3 dollars for water!\nBeware the 10 dollars more to choose your seats!\nBeware the FORTY DOLLARS for a single carry on!  My carry on's cost more than my ticket!\n\nBeware this shoddy, lackadaisical airline.  May it either wise up and treat the customers right or may it CLOSE."
1,"Unlike the Le Village Buffet at the Paris. Ballys is also another of my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.\n\nLike what, I had wriiten in my other reviews about Las Vegas Buffets seafood and prime rib are my favorites."
0,"Not very exciting at all, and definitely over priced.  I would only eat their food if someone paid for me to eat it and I were desperate to eat that day.  The ground beef had a bizarre flavor."
1,"I frequent the Salon at the resort.  Michael Belville the Salon Supervisor has been taking care of my locks for about 6 years.  We first met when he worked for the Westin Kierland Agave Spa.\n\nMichael got my hair back to health after too many trips to a popular salon in town and that ended up over treated.  Since then I have never received more compliments on my hair in my life.  One day I was standing in line at the check out in the grocery store and I could feel someone touching my hair.  No kidding.  The woman told me she thought my hair was so beautiful.  Seriously, all thanks to Michael!  \n\nWhen Michael left to go to the Sancturary Resort I followed him there.  Are you kidding me?  You know how serious a girl is about her hair.  And after receiving so many compliments it was the right thing to do!  A couple of months ago I arrived to the salon with the lights out and no electricity to heat the water.  You would have thought I would have had the sense to reschedule but it would have taken the earth to open up and swallow the salon for me to leave without my highlights treated.  This is how far I will go to have Michael do my hair.  \n\nThe staff is always so friendly.  I appreciate the email I receive to confirm my appointments and a personal phone call for a friendly reminder.  Thank you Sanctuary Resort and Michael!"
1,"Getting obsessed with Sichuan food recently; this place is authentic and SPICY. Small and uncrowded, as close as In-N-Out and cheaper than Smashburger for lunch. Infinitely better and comparably priced to Panda in the SU. \n\nI've been here twice now and had the following:\n\nSichuan chopped chicken - comes on a bed of dried chilis, great and peppery. Chicken was a bit bony, though. This is ostensibly their signature and it definitely tastes great and leaves your tongue pleasantly numb.\n\nSichuan twice-cooked pork - Fantastic lunch special dish, spicy in all the right ways.\n\nEggplant in spicy garlic sauce - not nearly as hot as the above two dishes, but amazingly savory and visually stunning. Almost my favorite dish, but it's hard to pick when everything is so good."
1,"I had never had Steak and Shake but had heard great things about their burgers from friends, so when we finally got one in Las Vegas I was excited to see if the burgers were really as great as some people claim. \n\nI stopped in with some coworkers around noon on a Tuesday. There was no wait to be seated, and our waiter came around to take our drink order pretty quickly. I went with the M&M shake which was very thick, stuffed full of M&Ms and super duper tasty.\n\nFor my actual meal I really had a hard time deciding what to get. I ended up getting three shooters (what they call their sliders) with cheese added, as well as fries. The shooters were small, but well cooked and three of them were enough to make me feel like I had a good lunch without that over-stuffed feeling. The fries were well cooked but super skinny. I prefer steak fries so for my own personal taste, the fries were the only real downside to my meal.\n\nLunch for 6 people was $45 before tip, but only two of us got milkshakes so that's why it wasn't more expensive. \n\nWill I be back? Now that I know there isn't an hour wait for a table at lunch, yes, I absolutely will!"
0,My husband and I had been here several years before and had a lovely dinner. Unfortunately that was not the case this time around. The service was poor and the food very bland. The two stars are for the view.
1,"So I decided to brave Lotus of Siam again, and admit that it's winning me over.\n\nThe crispy garlic prawns were a step down though; not very garlicky at all and I think the batter wasn't fully cooked.\n\nYou can totally eat the shells, but I'd still stay away from the tails, which have a tendency to poke you in your mouth. Ouch!\n\nThe nam prik ong was pretty fucking awesome. No wonder why it was featured on \""The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\"" The cool veggies (carrots, cauliflower, cucumber, string beans) offset the heat of in the spicy pork dip (my medium was plenty spicy).\n\nBut nothing is better than dipping pork rinds in pork. I mean, it's all the same animal, so it's meant to be.\n\nMy Thai friend Amy ordered an incredible crispy duck dish during our previous visit, and I was trying my damndest to remember the name. Oh well, next time.\n\nThe parking lot still sketches me out though. There were a few ambulances there when I went ... God knows what ... or who ... went down at the neighboring brothel and bathhouse."
0,"If I could, I would not even give the food 1 star. My wife and I both got sick from the\n food! We both had the runs after eating a green chili double burger and a fish sandwich. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"
1,"Drum roll please?....  Taps Signature Cuisine & Bar is one of the best kept secrets on the west side!  \n\nFrom the $1.98 Taps 99 homebrews, to the sophisticated interior and exemplary service, I am a bit concerned that I will have to wait outside in a line with one of those lame buzzers one day.  Until then, I'm glad to be able to skip the wait, especially on a Saturday night.\n\nThe food is very good.  They have some signature \""tarts\"" which are basically like a Calazone and/ or a classy pot pie.  I had the Mediterranean-style tart and it was nothing short of being awesome.  Inside the buttery pastry, I uncovered fresh chicken, aromatic basil, and sweet tomatoes in a rich sauce.  The waitress probably came by the table to check-up at least a dozen times and was extremely cordial.  Again, \""$1.98 Taps 99 homebrews\"" is not a typo.  I think that it tastes great, especially with an orange in it.  \n\nOn Saturdays, they apparently have some live musicians as well.  I attached a picture of the musicians on the night that I was there.  For some white guys, they were pretty good at the whole reggae thing.  I closed my eyes and felt like I was almost back in the Caribbean for a moment.\n\nThey also have a happy hour from Monday through Friday where the homebrew is only 99 cents for each pint.  So, be careful- Taps is so good and tempting that it will almost force you to exercise some self-control!"
0,"Requested an estimate via email and they were very prompt in responding with a quote and let me know how to book an appointment. I called and booked and appointment for move-out cleaning service the following Fri. Up until this point everything had been perfect, and that's when it fell apart. \n\nI had a scheduled move out walk through the Monday morning after our Fri cleaning appointment and I also had my utilities scheduled to be shut off on Mon as we were moving out. I got a call on Thur evening from the woman who owns this business apologizing that they couldn't clean my house the following day because there had been a family emergency and she had to leave town. We rescheduled for Mon morning at 8 am and I called our landlord to reschedule our move out inspection for Mon afternoon. \n\nMon morning I arrived at our old house at 7:45 (wanted to be early, just in case.) No arrived to clean as promised. I called, no answer, I waited, no one came. Around 9 am I received an email asking if the cleaning crew had shown up yet? I replied that they hadn't and I was assured that they were on their way. Several more emails were exchanged and just before 10 am the power and water were shut off. At this point i received another email letting me know that she was packing her own car to come clean my house personally, and that she would be on her way shortly. The problem is that she was coming from over an hour away! I sent her one more email telling her not to bother, cancel the service, you failed.  Also, I failed to mention that I was sitting in our vacant old house with my two year old son for over two hours at this point. \n\nThe icing on the cake is that I know I was lied to. She was unable to clean my house on Fri because of a family emergency and then on Mon morning she wasn't planning to clean my house herself anyway, she had a crew scheduled. Doesn't add up. \n\nAnyone who books Cleaning Arizona for any services does so at their own peril. I have never had a service company that failed to epically."
0,"The worst experience I had for car rental ever. I have been using Budget rental many years (at different locations) and never had any problem.  \n\nI went to them with my reservation and showed it to the representative (Dustin). He asked me if I want different car and my answer was no. But he gave me upgrade ($31/day) without any notice. I did had question with final charge but he said the discount will show later (I had a BCD code). It turns out that I was charged for a luxury car. When I complained, they treated me like a liar. I will never do business with someone who never honor their customers."
1,"Ok so to start off, i have never been to a Sam's Club before. I went in and everything was really cheap, so being someone who lives alone this place is defiantly a place to go to stock up on food. I got a 17 pack of Hot Pockets for only 10 dollars. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I will be coming back here for sure and i recommend you do too"
0,"I am a simple girl. I don't ask for very much in life....well, maybe with the exception of a date with Miami Dolphin's player Jason Taylor, but other than that, everything else should be pretty attainable. So with that said,  I would call myself a pretty loyal Best Buy customer until today. I recently placed a special order because they had the best price for my items that I needed. I received a call within 4 days saying that it had arrived and I could pick them up at anytime. I came in the next day to pick up my goodies and wouldn't you know......the bastards lost my order after calling me to say they had it!! As everyone's favorite cocaine addict Whitney Houston would say \""Ahh Hell to the Naw\""!!\n\nHow do you call a customer to say that you have their order and once they arrive say it is no where to be found!! Unbelievable!! I mean come on....is The Cosby Show Season 4 DVD and Expose's Greatest Hits to much to ask for??!! (Yes...you all can laugh now cause I have dated myself....and sorry Diana, you were the one that gave me the original and I have felt a void in my CD collection ever since I misplaced it, so I guess people can laugh at you too!!) It's really not that hard...I was so disappointed with the customer service. Won't be back or placing any special orders anytime soon!!\n\n+1 star for giving me some sort of comfort in my upset state. Beverly Hills 90210 Season 1 was on sale....I guess I could settle with that for a while....and yes...you can laugh once again!!"
1,"This place was great, we had ordered fried chicken, bulgogi and yukgaejang. Unfortunately they were both soups, should have ordered one soup so we could have tried different entrees. Service was great, food came to us fairly quickly and waitresses were very friendly. There is korean bbq where you can cook your own meat, it`s at a descent price.\n\nParking is easy to find since it has its own parking lot, it also has a patio which would be nice during the day."
0,"The Nile Cafe is very, very small. \n\nVery. \n\nI mean, really, the place is teeny-tiny...but it doesn't matter much. It's also usually empty. \n\nWhen I first started working downtown, I didn't know where anything was. I had no idea where to head for lunch, with the exception of the Jack in the Box across the street from my building...and that was just not going to do. Driving around on 7th St., one of the first beacons of possible culinary delight winked at me from the corner of Roosevelt - The Nile Cafe. I love Mediterranean cuisine, so I made time to stop. \n\nI've actually visited the Nile Cafe several times, and the experiences are always so different from one another. The food is consistently okay, with two marked exceptions - the delicious artichoke hummus, and the absolutely terrible falafel. \n\nThe service is where the big gap resides. There is one man who works there, (I perceive him as being the owner, although I have no actual reason to think this), who is very kind and courteous. He is patient, attentive, and soft-spoken but also friendly. Everyone else who works there is disinterested to the point of rudeness. Blank stares, no verbal acknowledgement...it is very uncomfortable to dine in, and, honestly, a little uncomfortable to order out. \n\nI go back occasionally to fulfill my desire for artichoke hummus. Other places make this, but none are as full of chunky goodness as their variety. Some of their soups are tasty, and almost everything else on the menu is typical Mediterranean fare - not bad, not great, and capable of hitting the spot if you're in the right mood. The falafel is baked, not fried - being moderately health conscious, I thought I would enjoy this change in preparation. I didn't. Falafel just needs to crunch, man!\n\nIf you're going to try the Nile Cafe, order out. It is so rarely busy -  you can be in and out in less than 15 minutes, unless you neglect to fill up your meter's belly and your car gets towed."
0,Bare gets 1 star and that was for the cocktail servers. VIP was a joke and they quote you one price and try to charge you another when you arrive. Over priced small pool with no Vegas vibe at all. More fun is to be at the Riviera Pool.
0,"Very nice bartenders, very slow food and usually wrong.  Not a lot of options in Summerlin so we always come back..."
0,"This place is the poster child for poor customer service.  I went here to purchase an accessory for my smartphone.  I was not greeted at the door by any of the eight store employees.  Granted three were actually helping other customers.  Two employees were adjusting phone displays which left three employees to acknowledge the existence that someone had stepped into the store.  I continued back towards the accessories and proceeded to look at the accessory that I came into the store to purchase.  I then waited in the hopes that someone would acknowledge me.  I even made eye contact with store employees.  Still nothing, I decided to exit the store with my daughter.  When I was walking out I stated to the employees at the counter, \""Thanks gentlemen\"".  They then acknowledged me.  That upset me more than anything.  I attempted to voice my discontent when a gentlemen who looked more like a tattoo artist than a retail employee turned and just walked away.  Another gentlemen, that's a stretch, just proceeded to talk over me and stated I should have just approached him.  What?  You work in customer service.  You need to be active.  I went to the Chandler mall store and they were great.  Avoid this store on 54th as if they all have the plague.\n\nThe difference between the two stores was in the employees - Chandler Mall (professional), 54th Street (Bouncers at a dive bar)"
1,"Steven was great guiding us through our first home buying experience. He really took the time to make sure we understood everything, even when we asked the same thing 12 times! Also when things weren't going right, he was quick to get them fixed. Although I didn't love his choice of mortgage lender, I'd  recommend Steven to anyone for buying a home! Thanks Steven!"
0,"Only in Vegas could you make reservations at a place that threatens to charge you $50 per person if you don't show up to be seated at a plastic folding table.\n\nThe service was fine. A little slow but they tend to drag their feet a bit when they're charging you a whole lot for not much substance, it's makes you feel like you're getting more out of the experience I guess.\n\nI asked the waiter if they had any vegan options and watched him struggle through the menu before saying he'd have to ask the chef, which I don't think he ever did because we never got an answer.\n\nEveryone in our party said they liked their meal but no one liked it enough to finish everything on their plate which says something.\n\nTheir prices are fairly astronomical for what you get and I believe that they try to cover up what is basic food with a fancier name. Roasted Corn Soup = one of the cartons of soup from Trader Joe's, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos = raw tuna chunks with a side of commercial grade tortilla chips, Cornmeal Crusted Chili Relleno = big jalapeno popper, Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak = Chili's summer special.\n\nI'm sure there are good aspects of this place, we just didn't see them. \n\nI guess everything in Vegas is a gamble."
1,"I decided to dine at Good Food on Montford for my birthday.  2 reasons: it's highly recommended (look at all these 5 stars!) and it's on Montford, which makes post-dinner drinking easier since we could just walk up & down the street.  NOTE: parking is limited.  You may as well just look for a spot on the street.  DO NOT park in another lot or you risk being towed.\n\nConsidering that I have been disappointed by so many highly recommended places, I was trying to keep my expectation low all day.  We called at 5:30 (they open for dinner only) to make RSVP for 7 people.  My bf & I arrived earlier than expected and they already had our table ready.  The place is tiny but it feels warm and intimate.  Overall I like the decor & atmosphere.\n\nBecause I was there with my closest friends, I didn't pay much attention to service since we were occupied with conversations.  It was a little slow at times, took a while to be able to order our wine after we asked for a minute to look at the options.  They could have brought the bread out earlier since we didn't get to order food right away.  But overall it was fine.  We were having too much fun to mind the wait.\n\nNow the food... I am glad to announce there was no disappointment!  With a table full of foodies, we just forked each other plates.  Food are served tapas style, with the exception of the few larger plate items.  Here are my thoughts on some of the items:\n\nSteam bun: Reminds me of chinese sweet pork steam bun at dim sum places.  It was very delicious.  Well executed item but it's a little pricey.  The surprise hit item of the night.\n\nBeef carpaccio: It was fresh and served with a small side of arugula & shaved parm.  Not the most flavorful item.\n\nFalafel: The only item I say you shall skip.  It's not crispy and fluffy like it should be.  The consistency resembled play-doh... not exactly appealing as a food item.\n\nBroccoli soup: Very delicious and sizable.  I'm a soup freak and I loved it.\n\nPEI mussels: Everyone swore by this item and we love seafood.  The sauce was indeed fabulous.  It's a nice change from the typical white wine or tomato sauce.  The coconut and curry and cilantro were perfect together.  It's of good portion as well.  \n\nDuck fettuccine: Not at all what I thought it would be.  The sauce threw me off a little, it's more tomato than creme.  The duck was a little tough.  It was good, but not as great as I hope.\n\nCrispy quail lettuce wrap: More like quail served on a bed of lettuce.  Don't get me wrong, the little birdie tasted fabulous, but it's not as elaborate as it sounds.\n\nChilled noodles: light and tasty.  One of the more filling dishes.\n\nSeared scallops: Good, solid dish.  Not sure what it was served on, I thought it was risotto.  I had a little bite so I couldn't tell for sure.\n\nPomme frites: I'm not a big fan of fancy french fries.  It tasted good, but not sure if it's $6 good.  My friends said the truffle oil was a bit strong on the top. \n\nPork Tenderloin: It tasted good... but I felt like something was missing... not sure what.  The pork was tasty and moist.  The polenta was good.  \n\nPot de Creme: For someone who doesn't really eat much chocolate or sweet, this is a good dessert to have.  Not too heavy, enough chocolate taste but also a good hint of expresso.  \n\nWarm cobbler with vanilla ice cream:  Very cute presentation, since it's in an individual baking dish. \n\nWHEW!!!  I felt that I need to review all these items.  The food overall was excellent.  I see why everyone raved about this place.  Now I'm freaking hungry!"
1,"Gaucho is beyond awesome. The meat is high-quality product, over-the-top well prepared. The staff is enthusiastic about what they do. The whole experience is like going to a good friend's house, discovering that some of your other friends have also come over, and then being served implausibly good food."

1,"I am happy now - i found absolutely fantastic massage place next to my place. \n\ni have to say i haven't tried everything spa has to offer but i can vouch for two things - you'll have a great reception staff when booking your appointment and you'll get great massage therapists! \n\nI've been here several times, stumbled upon the place by chance - i was looking for something safe to treat my pregnant friend to. They have special treatments for those expecting and that won me over - i was very nervous to make it safe for her. :)\nI emailed the request with my preferred arrangements (i do that to check how they react with the website ;) ) and was more than pleased - i got prompt callback, receptionist was exceptionally helpful with my arrangements. \nI got massage with Luna - she is very nice and delicate person, yet with a proper firm touch when it comes to massage! \nI wasn't all impressed with their nail salon though. The staff is friendly but amenities and choices of nail polishes didn't impress me at all.  \n\nSo i came back for what i really liked - couple deep tissue massages. This time it was with Tia and it was awesome!\nTo the point that i am torn apart here ;) on one hand i want people to know about how great massages are, on the other - it will all end up overbooked in future if you, people, take my word for it :) \n\nPrices wise i guess it is more or less same for similar level establishments around the city. Prices are listed on their website.   \n\nI am definitely coming back for more massage goodness from Tia!"
1,"St Francis is definitely the newest hottest place in Central Phoenix.  Another restaurant renovated from an older building, which seems to be a trend in Phoenix.  Somehow the old is revived again to make it more appealing and cool again.  I guess it's just like how trends come and go, then get recycled back into society as years past.\n\nSo with all that said you could guess that St. Francis looks quite exciting on the inside and out.  Just because the outside looks sleek and the decor gleems coolness doesn't always make a restaurant top notch though.  The food here is outstanding with fresh products made into delights of joy.  The chef is very creative with all the dishes and it shows.\n\nNo wonder every time I've been here the place has been busy.   Doesn't even matter if it's a Tuesday night, people will be here.  My only complaint about this place, which is a minor one for me, I wish they had a better happy hour that included some of their food.  The drink prices are great, but if you're looking for a deal on food this is not a place to come for happy hour."
0,"Our family of 6 had New Years Eve 2015 dinner at this establishment.\nOur server Micheal was nothing short of spectacular.\nThe meal fell quite a bit short.\nThe lack of meal choices was disappointing to all.\nThe real problem however, was after completing dinner, we were all enjoying our wine and conversation when the Manager came to our table, asked how our meal was, and then suggested we all proceed out to the New Years Eves party being thrown by the hotel.\nWe told him we were still finishing our wine, and he then told us we could just finish our wine out at the party and became more forceful in his mannerisms, and made the comment we needed to move out to the party which was outside in 32 degree temps  raining, and nobody there with the exception of Josh the Bartender who took our family photo.\nThis place is NOT worth the $250.00 per person cost for dinner by any stretch of the imagination.\nMay I suggest if you are looking for an excellent steak house Dominicks in Scottsdale is a great place to visit with many choices for each individuals palate."

1,"Stopped at Bobs at 2:30 pm not realizing they close 3:00 pm looked like grill all clean ready to leave for day, but they said have a seat that they had no problem taking order.  placed order and felt welcome not at all rushed.  I said we could leave but was told no problem service was great and done with a smile.  Great food and very nice service."
0,Went here last night and the night started ok. There were only 3 other people in the place and we had the worst service ever. No drink refills or help! The mangaer/owner she didn't show any care when i talked to her and i will never eat here again. Also you could hardly get into the rest rooms because of the clutter of tables and chairs.\n\nFood was ok but nothing to write home about or worth the price they were charging. No wonder they rely on coupons to get people in to their place.\n\nalso becareful with their happy hour specials as i asked for a $2.00 special and she brought me out a large draft and then charged me more saying i didn't ask for a bottled beer.\n\nHorrible management and tactics! BEWARE!!!
1,"OK, the food is excellent.  Tempura batter is light, served nice and hot, and a huge assortment of veggies and shrimp.\n\nSushi?  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and all so non-Scottsdale priced!  Definitely pay attention the specials on the board.\n\nDinner entrees - equally huge and a great value, and, very tasty.\n\nOnly loses a point because the location and atmosphere is kinda eh, but it's clean, servers are always sociable and efficient, and again, the food rocks.\n\nGo!"
1,"We attended for Gilbert Yoga Days. \n\nIt was only a short class, but it was a lot of fun. Decent work out and I felt great afterwards.\n\nAnd the people were awesome!"
1,"After a few hours hanging out at the bar, I was in the mood for a Fatburger.  I ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese.  The wait was the usual 15+ min....standard for Fatburger.  I appreciate the fresh food, so I don't mind the wait.  The Burger was awesome as usual.....it didn't have a chance.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EzUypdlXXX75D_Cj14DnuA?select=ZlevLbfaM4ZX2BkAxIQNow\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
0,"UPS on GVP & Pebble: Terrible!!  I asked for next day delivery service and explained that it was imperative for a SATURDAY delivery. Idiot scheduled it for Monday. Now I'm screwed and manager, Michelle, was NO help. Did not take responsibility for their screw up. She blamed me for not double checking  which i should gave done but she never took responsibility either!! Don't trust them to get it correct. Double check the work."
1,"Interesting.  Fun.  Inventive.  Intimate.  There's lots of restaurants around the country reinventing dishes and deconstructing others.  This one is about average for the genre for me.  I would come back and try some other dishes because I'm not sure exactly how good this place is yet.  \n\nI started with a really good house cocktail.  They make a manhattan that tastes like it met a camp fire.  Smokey and a little sweet.  Very tasty.  I had the brussels sprouts and their version of a cassoulet.  I've had a lot of brussels sprouts these days.  Seems everywhere I do there's a rendition.  These are tasty.  Bacon, a little sweet, a vinaigrette, crunchy, a little rich.  I liked them.  The cassoulet was good, it had some highs and lows for sure.  I liked the chicken hearts and the fried chicken wings but the sausage and pork belly weren't my favorite components.  The sausage was over seasoned for the dish or maybe the wrong seasonings for the dish.  I'm not sure but it bothered me a little.  I am sure I would have liked them in something else.  The pork belly wasn't the unctuous braised melt in your mouth kind I really like.  Cassoulet is always very rich and this one was as well.  I liked the tomato base as it cut the richness and added a bright note.  \n\nI ordered the lemon lavender cake and some french press decaf for dessert.  The dessert is excellent.  It comes with a slightly salty pistachio tulle.  Nice!  Decaf is very good.  My wife had a decaf and a cocktail and the total was $125 with a tip. It's a really small restaurant but it wasn't full by any stretch at 7pm on a Friday night.  Still, I would call for a reservation.  We got lucky with parking on Braddock.  I'm not sure where you would park otherwise."
1,"WOW the sushi here was AMAZING!  I am still dreaming about it.  Next time I visit Montreal, I am definitely returning to Tri Express.  Great food, great service, really nice decor.  Such a small and cute restaurant, but I would recommend a reservation since it's tiny and it was PACKED when I was there."
1,This is my regular DD (for those of you who don't know the lingo; that stands for Dunkin Donuts). I fly through their drive-thru 2-3 times a week. They are usually very speedy and efficient. One of the girls suggested a hot coffee with caramel mocha ... It was delicious!!!
1,"Today, I was craving some Filipino food, so I went on-line, and selected the Casa bakery and restaurant.\nWhen I arrived, I was promptly greeted by \""Tony\"" at the counter.  The first thing I saw was the delicious bakery items in the case on my right. Cakes, tarts, breads, \nCheese rolls, cookies,  etc.  I selected the chicken adobo- from the menu on the wall that shows a picture of the entrees to select from.  So, I added some Shanghai rolls, and three coconut tarts to go with my three orders of chicken adobo.\nI took the delicious food,  which had been freshly prepared for me to my mom and a Filipino friend Cecile. We all absolutely loved it!!\nIf you want a 10 star experience, try it out,\nyou will not be disappointed! !\nMike Larsen"
0,Meh. It could have been a lot better. Way too many sale associates for the amount of employees doing custom fittings. Many store associates just walking around instead of helping other consumers in the store.
1,"The service is incredible. Which is equally on par with the food here. Love the atmosphere. I am never disappointed when I eat here, and will continue to show up in the future as well. Great company top to bottom."
0,"Brigitte nailed it, and I don't want to drag on my review too much since she said it so succinctly. \n\nPlayboy club is the spot where you stop if Moon (upstairs) is still closed, so around 10- 1030 pm.  Great views of the strip, and there are a few higher limit table games ($25+), such as blackjack and roulette. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty dead, though, and it really only serves as a way to kill time until Moon opens. 2 stars for the great view and the playboy bunny waitresses and dealers."
1,"I LOVE 5 guys burgers and fries! \n\nLittle (meaning 1 patty) bacon cheeseburger is the way to go! Their bacon is so crispy, just the way I like it! I get \""everything\"" on it. This even includes grilled mushrooms and grilled onions. They carefully place each topping on and fold it in the foil with perfection. \n\nThe fries are good although not my favorite. I like that the post where their potatoes come from up on the white board each day. One regular size order feeds 3 people!!! \n\nPeanuts to munch in while you wait. I love that. \n\nThey also have those awesome high-tech touch screen soda machines that are sweeping the nation! \n\nLacking that fifth star solely because of the price. For this family of 3, we spend no less than $25 in a single visit."
0,"My roommate and I went here fir the first time today. The price was the only thing that was great. The chicken was dry, the tzatziki sauce was bland and thick, and the so called Greek dressing on my side salad tasted like cheap bottled Italian. The fries were ok, hummus was bland, and I said no onions on anything, yet onions were on EVERYTHING. needless to say, I will NOT be going here again. I can't even say that this was the McDonalds of Greek restaurants cause I would have rather eaten an McDonalds."
0,"So I can only hope the server(s) involved with our table read this because they'll be the only other people that truly understand this review. At the very least,read the last chunk of my review. Part of me feels bad but the other part wanted to let her know we were well aware she didn't care.\n\nWe had a table of 4 for happy hour tonight; three of which were severs ourselves. We were started off with drinks by a male server,didn't catch his name but he had gauges I believe. Then Rachelle I believe her name was took over. Ordered our food,2 pizzas and a dip. The pizza came out wrong so we waited 15 minutes after the food had been dropped for our server to check and see how it was.she finally came and grabbed the pizza to be fixed. \n\nThe entire experience we wondered why she wasn't involved in our tables as the rest of her section (didnt seem to be overwhelmed as she strolled about. They have drink AND food runners,so there's no excuse for neglect anyways). \n\nEither way,each time she touched the table she didn't ask how the food was,If we needed anything else,wanted another beer(s). At the end of our time there we asked for a doggie bag. After it took her another 10 minutes to wrap the food she came back to let us know the \""reason it took her so long was that the chef had made her dessert in the back,and that she knew we weren't going to tip well anyways\"". Had 40$ for her on a 28$ tab but we waited at the bar to break the bill. Just to make a statement."
0,"Had a tuna sandwich, which was OK, and a cup of flat coffee that I didn't finish.  This was $9.50... a bit steep. \n\nThe layout is awful... the kitchen bisects the seating area, and all of the kitchen noise is audible (read: deafening) in the seating areas.  \n\nI asked for milk in coffee and was told the half and half was behind me.  Half and Half is the farthest thing from milk in the universe. \n\nWon't be back."
1,"Very nice place in Fountain Hills. It did not disappoint.  We had the meatballs, the tamales one chicken and one pork.  I liked the pork better.  We also had the shrimp tacos, very tasty, and of course I had to have Tostones, delicious plantain slices that are fried twice, what is not to love about it.  My little boy loved them.  Service was excellent, they are very friendly."
1,"I love the Prickly Pear!  I was so disappointed when I drove by today to see it was closed.  The food was fabulous; however, after the restaurant next door closed, there was a backed up sewer smell in the restaurant.  We went there several times over a month and could not stay due to the smell.  That may have contributed to the downturn in business that caused the restaurant to close."
0,CLOSED. This building is shuttered and the place is CLOSED.
1,"After having them deliver on Football Sunday I came in for lunch and was greatly surprised. Friendly wait staff greeted me promptly, and helped me make a delicious choice. I had a  wrap and salad! Both were awesome! Good job ......No disappointments so far keep up the good work!"
1,"Love this place! Great menu, everyone is always super nice, and great prices! This has been our go to pace for sushi!!! Will be back for sure!!!"
1,"Yelp 365 Challenge #149/365 (Las Vegas Adventures)\n\nYou know how the blow hole in Hawaii is to the tourists? Well, let me take it back because no one wants to swim to the fountains for closer look BUT it is the attraction of watching the waters shoot up in the air. \n\nAnyhow, as the tourists in Hawaii are fascinated with the different water sites throughout the islands, tourists in Vegas (like me) will flock to the Fountains of Bellagio to watch five minutes of water shooting around. \n\nHowever, picture a family who was at the Adventuredome all day and walking into the desert heat to watch the water show. That's right...we all looked hot and dirty (not hot and dirty as in sexy but hot and dirty like we were running around like crazy!).\n\nGot the picture in your brain? \n\nOkay, now VISUALIZE that family WALKING THROUGH THE BELLAGIO from the parking structure to exit through the front entrance? Keep in mind this is early evening where everyone is heading out to dinner or going for a night out on Las Vegas. \n\nYes...we were misfits looking like the Hawaii Kai Hillbillies taking pictures with our iPhones :) \n\nAnyhow, as we walked down to the fountains, it was crowded (Saturday night) with people trying to sell bottle waters to passing out tracts while yelling on their microphones. \n\nWe found a spot because we wanted our grandson to see the waters shoot up and dance around (he's a water baby). Poor kid was miserable because he wasn't feeling well and we got alarmed that his cheeks got flushed because of the heat (not just the weather temperature but the heat from the crowd). \n\nThank goodness it was after 7:00pm because the shows are every 15 minutes. We didn't have to wait long. Faith Hill sang as the fountains danced. My grandson just watched and outstretched his hand as if he could catch the water. The pictures I took was priceless just like water show (it's free). \n\nThis is a definite recommendation for anyone to see this show because the background of the bellagio with the water dancing around and shooting high up in the air is beautiful and just romantic. \n\nNote: From afternoon to early evening, the show is every 1/2 hour. After 7:00pm to midnight, the show is every 15 minutes"
0,"After shopping on-and-off here for nearly 5-years, it's time for a quick update, and a slight downgrade.\n\n- Parking lot. Always cramped, especially when they park a 53' long refrigerated semi trailer or some other type of temporary something-or-another across one entire row of parking stalls. Most recent visit yielded exactly zero open parking spots for the entire lot... granted, it was NYE, but crikey.\n\n- Produce quality. Not sure what it is, but the produce has been on a fairly steady decline for a while now. Lots of shriveled peppers and wrinkly tomatoes... anemic asparagus... brownish limes. \n\n- Pricing. I grabbed a small package of cremini mushrooms and almost had a heart attack when they rang-up as $4.99 for 8oz. The *exact same brand* can be purchased at Woodman's (yes, organic, and yes - the exact same brand) for $1.99. A single red bell pepper was $4.29 here as well. No thanks.\n\n- Cramped aisles. Always hard to navigate through/around; worse when it's busy or when they are restocking things.\n\n- Salad bar. I challenge you to find protein on the salad bar. I'm a guy who likes a little chicken or turkey or ham on his salad... I've scoured that thing a dozen times and cannot find any meats anywhere. If I'm missing them, someone tell me.\n\n+ Samples. Everyone knows how great the free samples here are.\n\n+ Meat department. It's improved! I've been teaching grilling classes for most of the summer, and this is my primary source for those grilling goods. There's an older butcher there who is superb - very helpful and knowledgeable. \n\n+ Bakery. So good. Lots of sinful treats to choose from - all look and taste delish.\n\n+ Staff. Always friendly, always helpful. \n\nThe biggest reasons for the downgrade? Size, produce, and pricing. My last visit cost $39.73; had I purchased the same stuff from Willy Street or Woodman's, I guarantee it would've been under/around $20. I find myself shopping here less and less often because of this."
0,"If this is your idea of a ***good*** (not best, because there isn't such a thing as perfect) banh mi, please expose yourself to more locations.\n\nThe good things about this place:\n+Fast\n+24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes)\n+Bright and clean \n+Clean restrooms\n+Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing.\n+Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.\n\nThe caveats:\n-The sandwiches (more on that later)\n-Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!)\n-A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches\n\nThe sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh. \n\nThe bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.   \n\nTheir ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed! \n\nI have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya! \n\nWhat this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.\n\nAs another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!"
1,"My kids and I enjoyed it there .my 1 year and 3 year old had so much fun on the little kid side . There's 3 big trampoline for them you can't jump with them and that's fine. The place didn't smell like I though it would,great price for the little ones."
1,"Great food, just pricey.  go for happy hour.  the meatball sandwiches are awesome.  go for the pesto sauce and original (not the mushroom sauce, wasn't that good)."
0,"Just came in. Two people in front of me. Waited. Someone else came in. Large man appears from behind counter, moves to help the people who came in after me. I said \""Need a ...\"" but the people who came on after me were served first. I have bought Iphone batteries, watch batteries here but my next order will be online."
1,"This is the best sushi in Las Vegas and the chefs here are fantastically generous.  Surprising to some, some places in Las Vegas do have closing times.  We showed up 15 minutes before closing time but the chefs generously invited us in, and we had deliciously fresh sushi to our hearts' content."
1,"I can sum this dining experience in just a few words...\nSO FREAKING GOOD!\nMy friend SusanL and I decided we would hit up Hash House a Go Go. I have never been but have seen all the hype on the food network, so ... we went.\nWe already know that the portions are ridiculously huge... so what else can I tell you?\nThe food is amazing !\nI got the pork loin- It came with mashed potatoes- spinach- carmelized onions- roasted pepper- and some kind of cheese and a horseradishy sauce. \nI was a little worried that I would not like it... \nI was wrong . \nNow mind you I could only eat about a 1/4 of it. But what I ate was delicious. Perfectly mixed flavors to create a unique but amazing dining experience. My friend got the roasted butternut squash stuffed with risotto.  We shared a little with each other.  \nI couldn't decide which one I liked better, but I was not sorry with what I got. \nI got an ice tea to drink, but was not impressed as it had a smokey flavor and I really would like my tea to taste like tea.\nI also was NOT impressed with our server, It could be that she was having a bad day? Or she does not like being a server- she was kind of non existant.  I told her I needed to place an order to go, and she looked surprised that I needed a menu...  um ok? \nThen she waited til the end of our meal to put in the order - which we had to wait longer to leave. \nThat was the only bad part.  Our bus-boy was great and it was fun to watch him lift our heavy plates. \nI will definitely go again... it is just a matter of time..."
1,Just having some left over Bobbie sandwich from yesterday. Its even better the day after (kinda like macaroni and cheese).  How is that possible? Keep up the good work my boys...you rock the house :)
1,"Over the years I hae purchased many items from blankets, flask, and picture frames.  I have always been very pleased with how they have turned out and the people reciving the items were also pleased with the end result.  Will continue to shop here."
1,"Hey Hey, it's the SAMMIES!\n\nSuper Yummy here number 1!\n\nThe samiches are good, two sizes too, 7 and 10 inches. Well made with decent french bread, rather cheap as well, under 3 for 7 and 3.50 at 10.\n\nThe smoothies here were really good too, used a little more mango powder than other places, but that isn't a bad thing. It was a tasty treat for everyone =)"
1,"I've stayed here before with family and I remember the experience to be awesome but now staying here first hand with my boyfriend I found it to be an amazing experience! The hotel staff were very friendly and they were very helpful with my late check out and didn't charge us a dime for it. They let us keep our room keys as souvenirs as well! Now the rooms were very clean, well furnished and comfortable. The only thing that sucked is we didn't realize that the room we booked didn't have a fridge or microwave, so the food we brought for bad. I should have read more closely online for the amenities before booking the room. They would of provided us with one but it would an extra charge. No big deal though. Overall my experience was amazing especially for the price we paid, it was a very good deal :) I definetly recommend staying at the luxor for vacation !"
0,Food was good. Service was slow. Did not receive my appetizer and took 20 minutes for my free dessert with the Yelp coupon.
0,"A very expensive PF Changs. The food isn't bad. I love PF Changs, but for this amount of money, it's better spent on one of the many unique restaurants in Vegas"
0,"UPDATE: This past time was the second visit and the worst out of the two. The first time was pleasant enough. The patio has a great atmosphere, especially when the weather is nice. The beer selection is decent and the food is alright...depending on what you get. Last nights visit was with a sub par waiter that seemed to be across the board with the whole crew that was on. Everyone just seemed blah to be there. The live music was really, really good but unfortunately we sat in the bar and didn't get the nice patio/live music experience. I got the green chili chicken sandwich and he got the fish and chips. Both were just OK. *Tip: DO NOT order the meat/cheese board. It's $15 and just looks like someone ran out to Safeway and bought some packaged salami and pepperoni and cut it into quarters. Very disappointing."
0,"Went here on a Tuesday afternoon, only 2 people working and 3 customers. I got a gel polish change and wasn't very satisfied with the service. The 2 employees would bounce back and forth between me and the 2 other guests. I got a rockstar gel color and it peeled off about 2 hours later. Extremely disappointed since the glitter gel usually last 2-3 weeks. Definitely won't be back."
1,"Came here with my boyfriend and had a great time. Iris was our server and she was fantastic. Very knowledgable and friendly. We ordered the hummus and it was pretty tasty. I got the chicken dish with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Dijon sauce. Not a big fan of the sauce but everything else was fantastic. Andre got the ribeye with veggies instead of the traditional sides and he was very happy with it. He raved about it and told the sever how fantastic it was. Carlos (the owner and chef) came out to our table and talked with us about it and Andre told him again how fantastic it was. We'll definitely be back!"
1,"Squeezed us in, never felt rushed, world-class fare"
1,"This restaurant had been on my radar ever since I got back to Madison for the summer, and I'm so glad I got to try it before I left! It was definitely refreshing to see such an authentic Chinese restaurant pop up downtown, and I'm sad that I won't be around to see how the business continues to grow.\n\nI ordered the BBQ pork (cha siu) rice bowl, which came with a side of boiled bok choy. It definitely satisfied a craving I'd had all summer for traditional Chinese cuisine!! Although the best part of the rice bowl was definitely the sauce that was drizzled over the BBQ pork and the rice, I enjoyed how everything went together.\n\nThey also have a variety of 'street food' style appetizer items, such as congee, BBQ pork/beef/chicken on a stick, and Chinese doughnut. \n\nHong Kong Station is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area, although I do believe that they could use a few big improvements: 1) complimentary hot tea, which is pretty commonplace at any decent Chinese restaurant; 2) servers/hostesses who can speak better english - way too much got lost in translation when we were ordering our meal, I was almost afraid that our orders were going to come out all wrong - this was particularly important to me because we had one vegetarian dining companion; 3) ix-nay on the gaudy decor - I get that they are going for a 'hole-in-the-wall'/'dive-y' type of appeal, but it just made the place look cramped. With these changes, it is easy to see HK station becoming a Madison favorite! :)"
0,"I really wanted to like this place! Before even trying it for myself I heard good things about this place, but the 2 out of three times I've been I have found hair in my food. Service was great all three times but the hair in the food just did it for me. I'm going to assume this happens often because of their dog friendly patio (where I sat all three times). They do have a great beer list and it changes weekly so if I do go back maybe I'll play it safe and just drink."
1,"Let me start by saying  I am NOT a steak person. I'm a simple girl, a burger will usually do and I do enjoy seafood from time to time. For my birthday this year my sig other opted for me to try a change and made reservations for Del Friscos. I was definitly pleasantly suprised! I ordered the filet, medium and it came out hot, fresh, seasoned well and juicy. The butter and chive sauce that accompanied the baked potato left no room for sour cream or any other additive. The service was impeccable and the wine suggestions were on par. I would definitly recommend and will be returning in the future :)"
1,Great experience.  Food was excellent.
0,I was there yesterday waiting for my second drink over 2 hours and never got it when I asked for my check it took the bartender an other hour to bring it to me and to my disappointment I seen that he charged me for both of my drinks even he never brought me the second one
1,"My second favorite vietnamese restaurant in the valley. Great pho, great atmosphere... spring rolls are to die for. Can't go wrong with this place, everything is good here!"
0,DO NOT COME HERE. This was the WORST food I've EVER had in Vegas and I've lived here for 19 years. I literally almost vomited and requested a refund through Eat24 because I sure as hell wasn't going back there!
1,Staying at the Wyndham across the street. Yelped restaurants in the area and this was the closest one and with great reviews so I decided to try it. I'm glad I did. Staff was super nice and friendly and food was great. I got the Margarita Extra Pizza with a beer. The crust was crispy but yet chewy and the sauce and cheese was great. It was nice and light. Ended up returning for dinner. Got the Torino sandwich.  It was made with their freshly cooked pizza dough!!!!yummy!! The sandwich is huge. Could only eat half. I recommend this to anyone.
0,I went in expecting a four star restaurant but i was sorely disappointed. The food while properly cooked and seemed appetizing but was bland and they seemingly did not understand how to make our food spicy and they did not have a spicy sauce to add of the top. \n\nHowever the Mandarin gourmet garlic was a delight. The garlic sauce atop the chicken was very tasty though the chicken was a little dry. I would get something with the garlic sauce because that seemed to be the only item with lots of flavor. Also the service was very slow because there was only one server for the entire restaurant so be prepared for a wait.
0,The location and atmosphere are fun but the food is just mediocre to me. I'm not sure what all the buzz is about and why there is a line out the door almost constantly. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things but the food really doesn't seem to be something extra special that I couldn't make at home.
0,"When we were led upstairs we enjoyed the ambiance. Inside seemed very authentic.  To start out they gave us bread and our drinks.  Was a little disappointed their was no oil and vinegar for the bread (or even butter).  When we asked the lady for some oil and vinegar, she didn't say anything or even smile when we asked.  Once the food came out it looked great.  Was tasty; nothing too special about it though; could tell they used basic cheap sauce (shrimp Risotto).  Over all the food was good.  When the bottle of wine was brought, out he poured about 4 drips in the glass.  Not even close to enough even tell if it's ok or not; also didn't offer the cork to look at.   Once he poured the wine he put way too much in. Very disappointing seeing they don't even know how to pour wine.  Also about an hour after we ate, all three of us got sick.\n\nOverall:\nFood 3/5\nAmbience 5/5\nService 2/5\n20-30 dollar plates."
0,"O my Pittsburgh Pirates.  What a storied history you have!  But the last time you went to the post season was in 1992,  and I remember it well.    I worked as a ticket taker at the old Three Rivers Stadium and I have such fond memories of working there.  I was 17 when you won your last divisional title and I don't think you've had a winning season in my entire adult life.\n\nDon't get me wrong, my Bucs!  I do love you so much.  In a way, I have to.  See, you're like the boy I knew in grammar school who was such a sweet kid, but he was constantly failing his classes--and he lived in a nice house!  \n\nLet's take a look at your records since 2000.  I warn you dear Pirates--it won't be pretty.  But it's something you have to come to terms with:\n\n2001:  62-100 (last pl)\n2002:  72-89 (4th Pl)\n2003:  75-87 (4th pl)\n2004:  72-89 (5th pl)\n2005:  67-95 (last)\n2006:  67-95 (5th pl)\n2007:  68-94 (last)\n2008:  67-95 (last)\n2009:  62-99 (last)\n2010:  56-101 (last)*     *As of 09-29-2010\n\nSo that's six seasons in last place, two 100 loss seasons, and this season has been the worst so far.\n\nYes, I'll still go to your games next season.  I'll still go with my husband, my co-workers, and my Girl Posse.  My dad and I will still have our father-daughter nights out here.  But like the parents of that sweet little boy in grammar school with the failing grades, you're really trying my patience.  And don't forget, the Washington Wild Things have been wooing me for the longest!"
1,"Every place that serves or sells hummus manages to provide a vastly different taste - some are good, some are very good, and some are not edible.  Pita Jungle manages to consistently create quite good hummus, and they do it with multiple flavors.  I have simple tastes and am a creature of habit so I usually order their hummus and chicken.  Not only is their hummus good, but few places that I have been to create chicken that is as flavorful so it's hard to pass that up when I go to Pita Jungle. \n \nSome other great options are the California Beach Club (I sub the turkey for their fantastic chicken), and pretty much all of their pizzas or lavosh crisps.  And in the same vein, when I go for the lavosh pizza I tend to order their chicken glazed lavosh pizza.  For those of you who didn't notice any pattern, chicken is a solid way to go."
1,Great food! Good prices!
1,"Good Korean food outside of Chinatown!\n\nIt's found in the shopping center with the Regal Colonnade 14 movie theater. From what my boyfriend has told me, many stores have come and gone in that area, but this restaurant still stands, so it must be good right?\n\nI ordered the stone pot bibimbap, which was really delicious! It comes with bulgogi, cucumbers, bean sprouts, mushrooms, rice and topped with an egg. The hot stone pot gives the very bottom layer of rice a crispy texture. The size of the bowl is bigger than some of the other Korean restaurants I've been to and cheaper as well.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered Jun's special and my friend ordered the mandoo soup. Both agreed that their dishes were delicious. I'd definitely come back here to try the other dishes whenever I have a craving for Korean food and don't want to make the drive to Chinatown."
0,"I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers."
0,"I think myself pretty patient, but enough already. I ordered delivery.The food came on time, but it was more expensive than it should have been for lunch specials- so clearly I was charged full price.  when  I went to sign the credit card receipt I crossed out the tip line, planning on tipping in cash. The guy took the receipt out of my hand and before I could pull cash out of my pocket said \""no tip? I am loosing money coming here!?\"" Is it just me or is that really rude? \n\nAfter all that the food is only OK- I ordered the chicken and garlic sauce with fried rice. The rice was too salty and there was barely any chicken. The vegetable lo mein was OK. I will not order here again."
1,"Mess load of Nachos(carne asada) came jam packed with lots of toppings, meat, guacamole,cheese, beans and were a great deal for 7 bux. Carne Asada burrito for 5 bux was simple and tasty, not enormous, but def more than enough food. Don't expect a neat and clean restaraunt, as no one was cleanin tables, but hey its a taco joint so we weren't suprised."
0,"We were invited to meet family was visiting from out of town here.  It was bad enough walking through the smoke infested casino, but I believed that in the Restruants you were not supposed to smoke where food was served.  In this cafe people were smoking and blowing smoke while we were trying to eat.  It was disgusting. The food here was below average as well.  I know that there is smoking in casinos, but to serve food where people are eating should be against the law !!!!  Never going here again!!!"
0,"Went here June 20, 2013 for a quick snack before heading out to the WSOP. Waste of time and money. Pizza was gross and overpriced. The coffee I wanted to return, but we were in a hurry to get to the Rio so I kept it. Won't be coming back."
1,"Nestled into the Sonoran Desert about 40 minutes from Downtown Phoenix, this resort celebrates its rugged Southwestern spirit while still offering an exceptional luxury experience.\n\nThe Four Seasons makes it easy to customize your experience, whether you prefer to explore the nearby desert or lounge by the pool. My wife and I took two desert hikes--there are trails connected to the resort. The approximately five-mile Pinnacle Peak hike is only slightly difficult and offers amazing 360 degree views of the desert. I would recommend hiking in the morning--it gets hot! What a great way to start your day. \n\nWe selected one of the mid-rage rooms, and were suprised by its size and apportions. We had two large rooms, two bathrooms, a sun deck. The rooms are luxurious without being stodgy. One nice touch was the telescope--the desert sky provided amazing stargazing.\n\nThere are three restaurants: Talavera (fine-dining steakhouse), Crescent Moon (high-end Mexican), and Saguaro Blossom (poolside and lighter fare). We found the food to be the least memorable part of our stay, especially Talavera--which was mildly disappointing. However, the brunch buffet at Cresent Moon is excellent. I would also highly recommend the Carne Asada nachos poolside, which were some of the best I've had.\n\nPerhaps our favorite part of the experience was the quiet and solitude. Maybe it was a quiet weekend at the resort, but we never felt crowded. It was easy to get a prime poolside spot and we just strolled into the restaurants at our leisure. \n\nService was faultless. This is not an inexpensive weekend but, as I've found in my travels, with Four Seasons resorts you truly get what you pay for."
1,"My parents are from italy and we take them every time they come to AZ.  The food is from their province in Italy and they love it!  In fact, my parents will not eat at Italian restaraunts normally because they are usually disappointed - not here.  We are going tonight!"
0,"We waiting 2 1/2 hours and I must say I was sincerly disappointed. :( I am really picky when it comes to good steak, and I had heard this  place was great.. But I must say that for the waiting time it was SO NOT WORTH IT. The steak came out burned and it had fat.. YUCK and the service was Super Slow. You would think that for the amount of money that you are paying you could at least get a good steak. I must say. I enjoyed my Steak and Lobster dinner WAY more at TGIF at NEW Orleans for 13.99 the next day.. Would highly recommend.. there instead of STK.."
1,"This spot just had a soft opening so my friends and I decided to check it out. It's in a nice location on Rainbow, right by Oyshi. We came in and were greeted immediately by the hostess. There was only one other table of guests in the restaurant, so they weren't very busy at all. Understandable since they're brand new. We were told their grand opening will be in May, so hopefully business will pick up for them. \n\nLet's get to the food. We ordered the sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken, and chicken wings to start with. Sweet potato fries were okay, not my favorite. The popcorn chicken and chicken wings were pretty amazing. Both were crispy and very flavorful, especially with the sweet chili sauce that it came with. For our hot pot, we ordered the rib eye, which was delicious. There were three of us there and it was enough for all of us. The cool part is that when you run out of broth, they'll refill your pot with fresh broth. And the pot is heated up the whole time it's at your table so it doesn't get cold. For dessert, we tried the cheesecake and the salted caramel ice cream. Both were pretty tasty separately, but together, they were amazing.\n\nAs far as service goes, the staff was great and attentive the entire time we were there. The owner, Wendy, was kind enough to stop by at our table and ask for our input on what we ate. We had a nice chat about their food and she was very sweet and recommended that we try the stinky tofu next time. Our server, Ariana, was awesome and friendly. The other servers that helped were also great. I'm looking forward to many more visits to this place!\n\nAlso... bring cash! The one and only downside was they were only taking cash at the time, which was understandable. We had cash, so it wasn't a huge inconvenience at the time. I'm assuming they'll start taking credit cards eventually, so hopefully they'll have that taken care of by the time they have their grand opening."
0,"Not bad for a touristy, in hotel restaurant on the strip but not really \""dinner quality.\"" The food is tasty but not exactly island style. They have a huge drink menu, almost too big, but they are good and reasonably priced as well."
0,"Paid a lot of money for bad food, won't go back\n\n\nOrdered dr pepper steak tacos, meat cloyingly sweet, chewy and tough, only had one bite. Beans undercooked, rice only redeeming quality in meal. Husband ordered hamburger mac and cheese, hamburger helper tastes better.  Waitress completely uninterested in why she was removing full plates of food from our table.  42 dollars and wont be back"
1,Love the bagels and smear! Don't order a sandwich to go though bc it'll take forever. Customer service is still on par though!
0,"I will not stay here again.  I am an owner in the Diamond Resorts chain and I have never been treated so badly at a Diamond affiliate.  On the good side, the housekeeping staff was terrific.  However, we made a mistake and forgot to put our parking pass on our dashboard one night.  The security guard pasted a sticker on our window that would not come off.  When I complained to management that they could use post it glue and not damage vehicles for a simple mistake, the manager did not care at all.  Yes, we made a mistake.  Does that give them the right to damage our vehicle?"
1,"Only good experiences here for us. We adopted all 3 of our pit bulls from Benji's Rescue.\n\nThe prices are good being a big box store. Some things we buy on line, but get 2/3 of our dog food here and other items. The staff is very helpful and friendly."
1,"I showed up at 9:00 am on Sunday for yoga and t was great. There were some really advanced people as well as some beginners. Everyone mixed really well. We also had a special instructor too. \n\nI didn't buy anything at this store, but judging by how nice everyone was at yoga, I am sure the retail help here is great. \n\nI do own tons of Lululemon apparel though and  it has great quality and really takes the wears and tares well."
1,"Gourmet Pizza that doesn't disappoint.  I was sure pleasantly surprised.  I thought I'd take my kids there to pick up some pizza.  Super-friendly staff, clean, and very speedy service.  I had the \""My Greek\"" Pizza with the artichoke hearts, lite sauce, kalamata olives, onions and more, and kids had traditional Pepperoni.  We also got garlic knots that were the best I've had, loved them.  Highly recommend that you try this, there are so many selections, if you go to pizzayourway.com you can see their menu.  Will definitely be going there again.  They have wine too!"
1,"I tried True Food for the first time today. My wife and I arrived at 11:15 AM and it was already getting crowded. By 11:45 there was a big line of people waiting to be served.\n\nDespite the busy atmosphere, the service was prompt and excellent. Much of the menu is vegetarian or gluten-free. I tried the Medicine Man drink (black tea, pomegranate, cranberry) which was refreshing. \n\nI had a half-bowl of their daily soup, which was organic free-range chicken, brown rice, and vegetables. Although the serving size was small (it was a half-bowl after all), it was very tasty.\n\nThe turkey bolognese is something that my wife and I highly recommend. The turkey is minced and has none of the usual gamey aftertaste that turkey is known for. If you have kids, I'm pretty sure they would love this dish.\n\nThe fish tacos are also very tasty. Super-fresh and thick (albeit small) corn tortillas, with tomatilla salsa and perfectly cooked fish.\n\nDessert consisted of capuccinos and a dairy-free chocolate pudding with walnuts and pistachios. The pudding was a bit too sweet, and too big for just two people. Still, the meal was very satisfying and I look forward to dining there again sometime soon.\n\nTotal price for 2, tip included: approximately $75. A bit pricey, but worth it."
1,"High quality coffee and friendly/helpful/hipster staff, but soo overpriced. Barrier to entry is high, and for that reason, you lose a star. Sorry, Cartel, but be more affordable to the average folk."
1,"My husband and I hosted our son's Rehearsal dinner at Spiedini's.  I worked with Tonya to plan the event.  She was delightful and very organized.  The evening was so wonderful.  I had nothing but rave reviews for the food and service from all of our family.  There were 60 of us, so that is high praise.  The Chef, Gustav Mauler, was terrific and was on site to keep things going smoothly.  \n\nI recommend them to anyone looking for a wonderful evening and great food!"
0,"Half Price, Zero Service!\nI found the store to be alright and surprisingly I DID find something I liked and made a purchase. The staff was very friendly and I was excited about my order. Delivery was promised the next weekend, I was called on the delivery day with the time window for delivery and then 2 hours later, I was called back informed that they in actuality did NOT have my furniture in possession to begin with. \n\nThe person at the store could do absolutely nothing to help me and did not offer any compensation. What is worse, is that though I was promised follow up with a phone call by Monday morning, the call never came. I got in contact with them and was given the run-around about delivery dates and a bunch of EMPTY PROMISES (as mentioned by another reviewer). Two weeks later, I filed a dispute with the bank for my money back. \n\nThis store/\""business\"" is SHADY! Do NOT shop here and do NOT let any of the friendly staff fool you, they are clueless and rats just like the \""boss\"" they work for. Just so you know, their \""ALL SALES ARE FINAL\"" rule is null and void if they do not deliver what/when they say the will deliver. Thank you to the bank for informing me of that. I will peacefully go shop at RC Willy now."
0,"I was here to attend a dog show that had been planned for over a year.  I understand having dogs on the premisis is odd for most hotels although this hotel knew what was coming and was told what to expect.  Regardless, we were set up in the Courtyard which had no easy access to parking, unloading or even clean rooms.  The beginning staff at the front desk were extremely rude and it wasn't just a bad day.  There were five working and all five just did not want to be there.  I had to cheer up the girl I was working with just so I could endure the process.  My room was not ready at check in time and I had to come back later to actually get inside my room.  I had a dog with me and quite a bit to unload and its not like I came early.  The counter staff was very irritated I wanted my key to actually get inside my room.\n\nThey charged me 100 deposit of which I have yet to receive back ... will check that next week.  This was NOT disclosed upon making the reservation and I can understand the need since I did have dogs in my room but courtesy would say let me know this first.\n\nThe room service was awful.  I ordered coffee and only after not receiving it after an hour of waiting, I called and had to wait another 20 minutes.  The housekeeping staff moved the crate that had my dog in it when I clearly left a note saying do not touch.  There were no fresh towels in the room, just refolded towels that were already used.  The bathroom was disgusting with mold in the shower and grime and dirt all over the light fixtures.  The bed, I didn't dare look.  I had to sleep.\n\nThis hotel was contrcted and prepaid for a banquet for the group I was attending with and well, for $30.00 a person, we got salad, dried up chicken or BBQ meat (NO ROLLS!) and NO drink unless we wanted to pay $2.00 for a small bottle of water or $13.00 for a cup of coffee.  We had to tell the staff we needed tables and chairs as they planned on 50 people at this banquet using their laps and when clean up came, they were not pleased to do so and literally expected the guests to clean up for them.  One positive, I cut up the chicken and took it back to the room for my dog.\n\nAll in all, this hotel was a pit and not a chance in hell I will ever go back."
0,"Brought in my 11 year old daughter to get a haircut.  While the service was fast and the girl did a great job giving her the cut she wanted,  I wasnt very pleased with the professionalism.  The stylist were talking across the floor about going out and getting drunk the night before. I'm sorry but I don't feel that is appropriate when you have clients around,  especially a little girl."
0,"I am completely disgusted with this gym. My boyfriend has been a member for over 3 years and has an auto pay feature for his monthly billing.  Three months ago his credit card # was renewed with a new expiration date.  Since the card # didn't change he didn't realize he had to update with Gold's Gym.  Last week we received a phone call from a collection agency telling us we were delinquent on our account for over $300.  Gold's Gym never tried contacting us to let us know there was an issue with the billing or to ask about where we have been.  NOTHING was ever said.  When we called Gold's Gym they said we could settle with them but there was a $25 late fee for each month on top of what we owed them.  They were very rude about the charges and said \""It is what it is\"".  Are you serious??? He has stated he will never attend that gym again and we are looking into our new membership at Life Time Fitness.  The people who work at this gym SUCK!"
1,Best tea shop ever. Definitely need to stop by and try one. Wide selection. Each one has a unique flavor. Different varieties!!! A must!
0,WTH BRIO you broke my heart.\n\nI have visited brio in town square numerous times. but the Brio on Rampart is so much closer to my home. I came to enjoy their wonderful happy hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.\n\n1) it took the waitress 35 minutes to take our order. fine fine i'll let that slide..\n2) the waitress didn't bring us any bread. we thought it was because it was happy hour but all the surrounding tables had bread. \n3) we were sitting at a tiny cocktail table with 3 cups of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the salt/pepper sugar... summary. Not much room. when our food came he wouldn't take other dishes away. we asked him nicely to if he could take some dishes away and even passed it to him and he just walked away! HOW FREAKING RUDE. i thought he was going to put something down and come back because we CLEARLY had no room on our tiny little cocktail table to put 4 giant plates on the table and eat comfortably. but guess what. he left. like the jerk he is. \n4) when we needed the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found. this was suppose to be a quick drink eat and go that ended up taking over 2 hours because the waitress forgot we existed. \n\nthe food was still consistent and delicious as expected. but nothing ruins an eating experience worse than bad customer service.\n\nthe worst part of this visit was not only was the waitress terrible and inattentive. the food server guy was also terrible. it wasn't just one person that ruined my night. it was TWO. TWO TERRIBLE WORKERS. i couldn't believe the lack of customer service we received at this place.\n\nI'll never come back to this Brio again.
1,See below from Martha ...  Please make my life easier - go somewhere else.
1,"Amazing hotel!! Great service, clean casino and we had a wonderful stay!!!!\n\nWe stayed at the luxury suite for 5 nights and loved it! The suite is huge(well we live in manhattan so yeah very big!).... Have a separate area for us to chill, watch tv and have a good time... \n\nBathroom is clean and spacious, with a tv an separate room for toilet. \n\nOverall, we had an amazing stay, relaxed and happy.. Another good perk about this place is there are a lot of restaurants in the resort it self and you can easily walk around and find good food!"
1,"Had a friend recommend this restaurant when she found out I'd been eating vegetarian lately. Am I ever glad she did! The food was cheap, absolutely delicious and completely veggie. It's a cafeteria-style serving situation, and there were lots of seats, mostly full.\n\nThe spanakopita was great, the cannelloni was also very good and they have ginger beer. The second night I went in, there was a live band playing enjoyable music at a good volume.\n\nI really can't recommend this place highly enough!"
1,"I've been wanting to try RM Seafood for a while a it was out standing in many levels.  First off the service could not have been better.  I really wanted the clam chowder, but with what we ordered, it would have been too much, but the server was so kind to bring me a small bowl with several spoonfuls of chowder to try.\n\nWe started with the Futo-Fireball roll, which was one of the best rolls I have ever had and the flavor and texture was amazing.  We then had the BLT salad which was good.  We split the Branzino and the Cioppino.  Two totally different dishes, but outstanding flavors for both.\n\nIt was an outstanding meal in all levels, and a must visit while in Vegas!"
1,"This will be my regular lunch stop in town.  Probably the one place in UK that beats American BBQ joints... yeah, that good.  Maybe because the first time I had it was freezing cold and late afternoon, but the meat was plenty, tender and juicy.  The chili sauce reminds me of St. Louis bbq.  Sorry, vegetarian friends, pig is the only thing on menu here.  Oh, and expect to eat your sammy standing up."
1,"Unique little spot. Cool atmosphere. Very short menu, limited options. Server indicated this is due to its \""farm to table\"" nature, and depends on availability of fresh ingredients. At any rate, seems they are a little late to the \""farm to table\"" game. That said, the food was good. Cinnamon toast is great, cool brunch item or almost a dessert. The bacon is thick and hearty. Shrimp on a roll was tasty. Wings were 'okay' - a potent taste and smell and not as fresh as some other items. Definitely worth a stop - very quaint place to catch some nibbles."
1,"After reading all the rave reviews about BLT Steak's happy hour I wanted to try it for myself. Yelpers, once again you have not failed me. The rave reviews were spot on - this place is fantastic. \n\nBoyfriend and I snagged ourselves a comfy spot on a couch next to the firepit on the patio. The atmosphere is comfortable, romantic and warm. We were immediately greeted by our waitress who pointed out the happy hour menu. They have several drink options and many food options. We were there for the food and ordered a few items to share - the popovers (a must), the charcuterie plate, the burger and the truffle fries.\n\nHands down the standout of the night was the popovers. They were huge, fluffy, and full of eggy goodness. They are served with butter and salt - it's really all they need - yum! But I added in some of the meat from the charcuterie plate and it was an excellent combo if I do say so myself. Everyone who says get the popovers is right - get the popovers!\n\nThe burger was very tasty. A good size - plenty for sharing and cooked just right. The fries were my least favorite. I was excited by the description - truffle fries with parmesan cheese - but the fries were overcooked (too hard) and the truffle was overpowering. Not my thing I guess.\n\nThe service was really good too. Even though you'd spend WAY more on dinner inside I never felt like I was part of the cheap crowd. I felt like we were treated the same way we would be if we were dropping $200 even though we dropped less that $50. I appreciated that and it's smart because now I'm very likely to come back and blow a wad on a special occasion! Well played, BLT Steak!\n\n I highly recommend BLT Steak's happy hour. It was the dining highlight of my weekend."
0,If you rent from Fox you have to take a second shuttle to get your car. Once you get to the office to check in be ready to wait over an hour for someone to check you in. They have 2 clerks with over 50 people in line. Place is dirty and run down. I would recommend any other rental car than Fox
0,"First thing to notice about Meadowood Cafe is the state that it is in - the building looks shabby, the sign is missing words and the decor is straight out of the 70's. But try not to let this worry you too much, there are plenty of other things to put you off once you get past looks.\n\nThe menu is varied and well priced, but the food itself is greasy, tasteless and more than once I was strugling to identify the ingredients in my Chowmein. A disappointment indeed. Although I cant help but feel lucky that I got served in the first place - a few minutes after ordering we over heard a couple complain that thet had ordered meal almost 45 mins ago, and were having to leave because thier lunch break wasnt long enough. Shrugging this off as a one time thing, we then waited nearly 50 mins for our meal to arrive - not great service to say the least, despite the apologies of our host."
0,"The Good: I could state a few mediocre points, such as that the office was clean, but they aren't really of any great import.\n\nThe Bad:  The doctor only addressed part of my concerns, as I was very interested in seeking help on 2 different-but-related medical issues. Most of his focus was on one issue, with the other being set aside for another time. Though the first visit wasn't rushed, the second appointment did not feel the same. \n\nThe doctor seemed eager to use scare tactics during our two conversations, focusing on the possible lethality of a condition, ignoring questions of severity or likelihood. He comes across as patronizing behind a slightly jovial veneer and attempting to scare someone as part of pushing a treatment plan is unprofessional in the extreme.\n\nThe doctor suggested I obtain a basic blood test, which could be done via a blood draw at his office. I asked how much the testing would cost (I don't have insurance yet) and was told it would be between $100-200. The doctor was horribly wrong, as the bill was slightly under $500. Though his office did pay part of the bill and help reduce the total cost to me (after I complained), I still paid over $150 more than I had been led to expect.\n\nThe Ugly: During my first visit to the office I handed the receptionist my driver's license to be photocopied. It wasn't until 3pm the next afternoon that I realized she'd never given it back to me. When I called back to see if I'd left it there her response was, \""Oh yes! We have it right here for you in the desk drawer.\"" Glad it wasn't lost, but if you'd had my card sitting around all day and you HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER, I believe a call back to me would be in order. \n\nIn summary Dr. Marks is not a bad guy, but is not a doctor I intend on seeing again. I would not recommend him for your use as a general practice DO."
1,"I just undertook a tour of ALL the porn shops in Vegas -- all 30! And I am here to tell you, at the end of my research...\n\n...this store is the Best of Las Vegas! Adult Superstore is a chain with multiple locations, but this one is the best A.S.S. in town (even better than *MY* ASS, LOL). \n\nOn a practical level, the place is right off the freeway, with discreet parking in the back of the building, out of sight of prying eyes. It is clean, well-kept and feels safe.\n\nTwo stories, huge selection, reasonable prices (better than Deja Vu's prices, for sure). Two-screen theater and arcade upstairs for those who like to jerk it in semi-public. Amazing selection of rubber vaginas and creepily life-like masturbators (\""20 pounds of pussy!\"")...Mexican pocket pussies...giant dongs...cringe-inducingly-circumferenced buttplugs...\n\nI could go on and on, but it would be like trying to describe the contents of the Library of Congress. Futile!\n\nYou must be 18 to enter, which is a real shame....because instead of Bar Mitvah-ing and Quinceanera-ing our teens, plying them with useless shit like Last Dolls and wristwatches, a MUCH MORE PRACTICAL rite of passage would be to take them here and buy them a dildo/pocket pussy. I mean, we want to keep the teenage pregnancy rate down, right?!?!?!?"
0,"I wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to, I've gone to Bridgette's a few times. I had a good time the first night, but, noticed nobody in my party got to sing more than once. (I think it was a fluke that we sang at all) The second time wasn't even as great, we had friends from out of town with us that wanted to sing and some people in our party didn't get to sing at all. The last time I was there I was with a friend that's gay and he was treated like dirt in the bar. It's not a great neighborhood bar, it's a horrible place for karaoke (unless you're one of the karaoke dj's special friends), they aren't accepting of all types of people, and I had terrible service the last 2 times I went. I tried to give the place a chance, but, it's just not a good bar."
0,"I'm not sure if they finished renovating this place. We have spots where they were missing paint, AC not fully working on a hot summer day, and the overall decor looked half assed. \n\nBut that's not what I really came for. Just a good bowl of fresh noodles in that rich rich broth. What I got was neither. The ordered the #2 which was noodles with beef stew. The noodle lacked any real bite to it, the beef stew was more sliced beef rounds with zero flavor, and the soup tasted like a vegetable broth without any real color. Was quite disappointed especially considering all the other rave reviews of this place. \n\nMy friends ordered the dry noodles with the meat sauce and said it was banging. I had a bite of theirs and felt like they were just super hungy and trying to make me feel bad for ordering the wrong dish. Either way...I don't think I'll be back."
0,We went here tonight and we didn't have to wait. There was a lot to choose from but unfortunately not one thing I ate was any good. I wouldn't  go again.
1,"I don't give out 5 star reviews very easily, but when I go somewhere multiple times and it is always consistent, I think it is deserving.\n\nLing & Louie's is best described as Asian fusion, I mean there is meatloaf on the menu for goodness sakes!  But they do an excellent job modernizing some of the classics, and it is never greasy!  The orange chicken and crispy spinach is divine, the walnut shrimp so tasty, and I love the fact that they use filet for the beef in all their dishes!  It is always cooked so perfectly and the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth!\n\nThey do a great job on appetizers too, potstickers, sushi and the soups are all excellent, especially the chicken and rice, it has just a hint of spice.\n\nTheir drink menu has lots of fun and fruity drinks too, but if you are looking for something nonalcoholic, try the fresh squeezed limeade....it is soooo good!"
1,"I have been here a few times and like the Kilauea burger.  It has a nice spicy kick.  The fries are good.  The only thing I didn't like is that the last 2 times the burger has been overcooked.  I am not one to send food back, but I was tempted to because it was way overdone."
1,Hems...\n\nWill always like this place because of so many great memories there.\n\nThey have pretty decent food and a good selection of beers for a college bar.  Prices are very good but can get extreamly crowded at night and on weekends.
0,The front desk employee and bowling employee both acted like we were bothering them so it was really uncomfortable checking in and trying to get a lane. \n\nDon't count on the shuttle to the strip - it was full the 3 times we tried. It's not a private hotel shuttle so it goes to other hotels and when we tried to get on they only let a couple of people on from this hotel at a time. \n\nManager said its first come first serve when we tried to reserve a spot. \n\nCab ride was $30 each way so if you plan on staying here and going to the strip - add that to your costs unless you are patient and lucky enough to get on the shuttle - then it is only $8\n\nWe won't be staying here again - too many other options in Vegas.
0,"So, there's no negative stars, too bad. Tried ordering take out before actually eating there to try it - good thing, you couldn't pay me to eat here.\n\nThe only thing about the Colossal Cobb salad I ordered was the price. $10 and change for lettuce just enough to cover the bottom of the styrofoam with a sprinkle of toppings. Where'd they get their chef, Chili's? What a disappointment. All the reviews say ' a lot of food' ...for who, an infant?\n\nI had also ordered a couple of carmelized cookies as well. Didn't know deep fried, greasy discs of oatmeal harder than concrete were called 'cookies'. Good grief, the bakery wasn't even good! Had to spit those things out before they took out a filling. \n\nThe only good thing about Chandler Chompie's is Jason's Deli right next door."
1,"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned...I think. \n\nWell, I'm not sure where sampling beers on a Sunday afternoon at a micro-brew located in a former Catholic church necessarily fits in the whole scheme of things, but I felt I was violating some type of rule, code or commandment. Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.\n\nSince I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75. But after doing some quick math, I realized I needed to address my growling stomach first to avoid any unintentional purge-atory (rim shot). After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza. Aside from being crispy and tasty, it turned out to be the perfect size for one person.\n\nAnyway, back to the beer. Sorry. There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.\n\nRegarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar. It's sort of weird, yet cool, to see.\n\nSpending lunch here was a fun and pleasant experience and I was glad to see so many other people \""congregating\"" here as well. Okay, okay, I'm done.\n\n(+) = liked"
0,My son had his 3 year birthday party here last weekend. We paid a lot of money to get the basic party and we were really disappointed. The staff girls are so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything. When we arrived for the party they said they couldn't get a hold of us so they weren't sure if we were coming. I almost fell on the floor thinking we didn't have the space. We did everything from food to cake to party gifts. There were no toys. There was a cool kid gym to play but I expected more toys like kinder land or tykes n tots. It felt very rushed. The party was 3-430. They had all the kids come in at 4 to do cake then told us gym is closed  the kids had to stay n this room until 430. Everybody had fun in the end but I wanted to complain to management that for 350 dollars we got nothing!  A few balloons they provided and a few chairs set out for 20 to 30 people. The only star is for how nice the young girls were that helped with the party itself. I would never recommend kid ville to anyone. Save your money and book early at kinder land or tykes n tots or anyplace else.
0,"The Southwest Eye Center doctors determined I needed lens replacement for both eyes due to cataracts. Following their exams and prior to surgery I tried to tell the surgeon that I didn't trust the results of the left eye because of the technician's actions and her seeming confusion with the results. The surgeon would tolerate none of my input - he was not aware of my 30 years experience as an advanced degree bioengineer, nor did it seem he would have cared if he knew - but I know incompetence with equipment when I see it. As it turned out, the surgery on the right eye, the first done, was perfect. After the 2nd surgery was done two weeks later on the left eye, it was immediately obvious something was wrong. Three weeks later, the surgeon re-operated on the left eye and rotated the implanted lens 180 degrees. Unlike the right eye which was restored to 20/20, the left eye at best is 20/40 and is distracting at times. The surgeon in followup visits has urged me to have the left eye treated with a laser procedure to pierce the scar tissue obviously formed after the re-op. I am now consulting another opthalmologist.\n\nThere has never been recognition from the surgeon or Southwestern Eye Center that something was done in error. Either the technician screwed up, the doc screwed up, or maybe the wrong lens was implanted. I blame myself for not speaking up with more passion. I guess we are all intimidated by a doc who has zero empathy and does not listen - we shouldn't be."
1,"Never had a bad expereinece. \nAlways fresh.\nWait times can be a little long, but it is worth the wait for the fresh food."
0,I like to look at myself as a pho expert. I eat it at least once a week. This place was a huge disappointment. Not only are they racist! They think I don't know how to use chop sticks because I'm white!!! But the broth was so salty it tasted like they poured salt all over my food. I will not be going back here.
1,"There are many ways to do pizza, and the debate on the best pizza is heated, but I do believe I've found a rogue rookie with a lot of guts that makes a SUPERB pizza that's also at a great price. Ensure you get that great price by getting the doorhanger ad special. I don't give many 5 stars, but WOW this pizza deserves. My friends and I ordered the doorhanger ad special - 14\"" Specialty Pizza $9.99. They have several to choose from. I didn't have a say in which ones we ordered, but I didn't care, I was hungry. We ordered a pesto chicken and a chicken bacon ranch for delivery. I myself would've ordered the meat lover's....\n    Anyway the pizzas looked and smelled scrumptious, and one bite and I was sold. I could only eat 3 slices, and I tried some of each pie. The crust was perfect, flavorful and bready at a uniform 1/4\"" thick, and the cheese and toppings were definitely HEAVY on top of that! The crust supported the toppings very well and wasn't totally floppy as would happen with a thin, soggy crust. From my previous reviews you may also know I have a certain disdain for puffy bread with a thin paint job. \n   There was 1 slice of chicken pesto pizza left as 5 of us couldn't finish the 2 pies. Had that slice for breakfast this morning. Best reheat is to preheat your oven on broil, then set the pizza on a metal tray or foil on the lower rack for 2 minutes or less. NOT IN A MICROWAVE!\n   For value and quality ingredients, Spacoli's hits a home run into the stratosphere and is definitely on the All-Star team for best pizza in the PHX Valley, joining Grimaldi's."
0,"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."
0,The only good thing I can say is the place looks nice. Other than that it is a complete train wreck. The service was really bad. We had one drink which took about 10 minutes to get after we ordered. They didn't have the first two beers I ordered. I chose them off the tap handles?  They finally brought some chips and salsa. Three different servers tried to bring us food that we didn't order. I could go on and on but not worth it. For their sake I hope they get it fixed or they will surely meet an early demise.
1,"A ton of people told me to try this place, so I went.\n\nIt's very different than most restaurants. The place is old school, but so friendly. My pal and I had a great time! We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations; but you will not find any of that here. They are simple burgers that have amazing taste. I repeat, do not have your hopes up for something that will dazzle you, but the quality is great. The meat was awesome, cooked to perfection. There was nothing gross about the meat, no crunchy or fatty bites. \n\nGet the home fries.... Old school Heinz bottles where you have to hit the 57. \n\nThis place is worth trying. It seemed like a type of clientele that have been going there for years. Time for the younger hipsters to revive it?\n\nTry it."
0,"I have had no problems with this service until i had 111$ in Chips stolen from my glove box from this Place.  Ya i shouldnt have left them in there.  But they shouldnt have stolen them.     Make that $111 appear and i will revoke these negative reviews which i am going make on every platform avaiable to the social media,  4 chips total.  FROM THE WYNN   100-5-5-1...i just want it back, i dont care who did it .   111$   408.896.5160  I will be stopping by tom. am to speck to someone about this.\n\n\nIn response to the Comment Below from Management:\n\nIn no way am I Satisfied, if anything i was so pissed i hung up on him because he didnt care to make me happy.   It was only 111$, its not a lot of money.   But the amount of money lost for future Business is.   I was hoping management would have done something to make me happy, and its too bad because there service was cheap and fast but they did take the money.  Of course no one is going to admit to it and there \""HIGH TECH CAMERA SYSTEM\"" im sure would catch it.   \n\nIt's to bad there is so much lie and decet out here in Vegas and in the end i take responsabilty for leaving the money in my car but MANAGEMENT didn't take any extra steps to mke me feel ok with bringing back my car or refering ANYONE to this Business.   Its to bad too.\n\nI wouldn't have posted this review if it was the truth.  This is just a warning to future Customers, strip all valuebales out of your car"
0,place sucks.... if you want to pay $20 for a small burger and fries then come here. way to expensive for  a simple burger.
1,Great food! Great service!
0,"Let me start by saying I am not a picky person... But when 3 of the 4 plates on our table had dried food still on them ( mine actually had a cement dried chunk of chicken glued to the back of it )... I figured I had to write something.  The sheer filth didn't stop there... I took my kid into the bath room only to discover it hadn't been cleaned in something close to 10 years... My shoes were sticking to the floor from the stagnate urine, there was no towel paper and poop still in the toilet bowl.  After returning to the table, the waiter came over to apologize in broken English to tell me the dishwasher was really backed up... We ended up leaving as I couldn't eat another bite... This place is great if your looking for cheap and want to attempt getting food poisoning."
1,Loved the food !!! The ribs were great ! Best fried okra I ever had. Service was very friendly ! If you are ever in Charlotte NC you have to go to Mckoy's. I know I would fly across the country from California just to eat here !!
0,"This place was pretty disgusting. The only thing I could recommend is the gumbo, Other than that the food was bad. The shrimp was probably Tyson brand, at least it taste like it. My sis asked for fried chicken, waitress said they don't have the ability to do any frying. The waitress then offered chicken tenders, she brought out but we later thought, if they don't do any frying,how are the tenders, fries, shrimp and fish fried? Could've been all microwaved. Everything was cold. I would not recommend this place to the homeless...."
0,"Some of the worst asian food in Madison. Prices are good, but the flavors were bland and uninspiring. I tried the mango tofu, and even though there were a lot of vegetables and it looked pretty, it had almost no flavor. The sesame chicken was bland and had been sitting out. The fried rice was fried orzo, and it had no flavor. The chicken egg roll was okay. Even the soda machines were disappointing, they didn't have enough syrup in the Pepsi Max dispenser, so I got a glass of funky off colored carbonated water.\n\nI don't plan on going back."
1,"Their Sago with Gulaman is pretty good! Not too sweet, not too bland, just right!"
1,"Sehr nettes, zentral gelegenes Hotel. Preis und Leistung sind ok. Sauberkeit auch gut. Sehr gutes Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck mit gro\u00dfer Auswahl. Leider sind die Zimmer nicht gut isoliert und daher in \""alle Richtungen\"" sehr hellh\u00f6rig."
1,"I love, love, LOVE Seattle Espresso.\n\nI love it.\n\nI grew up in Arizona but have lived in Southern California for about 6 years now.  My family is still in Arizona, and the first place I go whenever I'm in town is Seattle Espresso.\n\nIt's just so good.  I can't emphasize that enough.\n\nMy three favorite things about this place are:\n\n1)  Iced White Russian Mochas - these are sweet but they don't over do it.  This is my favorite drink and I've never been able to find anything similar.\n\n2)  Cold brewed coffee (toddy) - okay, I know everywhere you go has iced coffee.  BUT, I no one has toddy like Seattle Espresso.  This cold brewed coffee tastes delish with a light splash of vanilla syrup.  I don't know how they brew this to such perfection, but they do.  Believe me.\n\n3)  Stamp cards! - you get a free drink for every 10 drinks you purchase.  This is pretty cool, especially if you buy coffee everyday.\n\nThe people have always been very helpful, and the vibe is so much better than a Starbucks.  \n\nDefinitely try this place if you want quality coffee.\n\nOH- and every Saturday morning they have a small farmer's market in the parking lot!  (But don't worry, there's still plenty of parking)."
1,"I adore this place! The food is always fresh, the cocktail & wine selection is amazing, the decor is romantic yet playful and the service is always on par. The happy hour is one of my favorite in Old Town. A must try!!!"
0,"My yelp review for the missing dozen wings got the Manager's attention back in December 20, 2012, so I thought I would write an update.

0,1. Warm prosecco. : -(\n2. No wifi (and free wifi advertised is the reason I chose this place)\n3.
0,"Wait, so let me get this straight...  You seat me at 5:40am, but you won't let me order anything off the after 6am menu because \""certain chefs specialize in certain foods\"" so I can't order anything with bacon or sausage.  Wow, I never realized frying breakfast meats was so damn hard.  And even after I order off the limited before 6am menu... you don't even bring me my food til after 6:30?!?!  \n\nLet me straighten another thing out... my friend CAN'T order scrambled eggs, bacon, and home fry potatoes.  He can have scrambled eggs, NO bacon, and french fries.  BUT, my other friend CAN have chicken fried steak, a biscuit, gravy, and HOME FRY POTATOES!?!?!\n\nAnd explain to me how I CAN'T order the salad that IS on the menu... BUT I CAN order the ahi tuna or chicken & waffles that AREN'T on the menu!?!?\n\nThen after I jump through all your hoops to order, you leave me with a menu with crosswords and puzzles on it, but you have the ONLY writing instrument in the whole restaurant??  And I think you better have a word with your \""specialized\"" chefs in the back.... cause none of the food tasted good.\n\nLAME!!"
1,"Awesome food! The chef and the staff and beyond generous and hospitable! While every white person in my family ordered variations of the burrito, I went left and ordered carne asada tacos. Perfect size, nice spice, and the ingredients were as fresh as possible! Everyone in my party enjoyed the location and decor. Shout outs to Frank and his mom who takes pics every five minutes.\n\nIf you want great food, grab a shot and some flautas here!"
0,Not good. Threw away everything I bought. Blech. :-(
1,"So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe's.  (Note: The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ doesn't stock dry beans).  So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods (see past review).\n\nI have been to the South Hills GE Market District before.  I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things.  Thus is the experience of GE Market District.  You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels.  AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans.  Fantastic!  They give you a map of the store, which is truly needed, because the variety and stock is endless.  The parking at the Shadyside GE is sort of hectic.  Making a left out of the parking lot is pretty difficult.  I enjoy these new Giant Eagle grocery-monopoly attempts."
1,"I got the most incredible ice cream headache on this day, haven't had one like that in years. Easy stop to make on the way home and had this ingenious tasty treat called a Gelati, which is the your desired flavor of italian ice with a squirt of custard. That is a great combo, and by the way did I mention I love custard? I'm from Wisconsin Ya know! I guess I wish they had more flavors of custard but I'll take what I can get in this land of no frozen custard."
0,The service was awful. Specially in the front desk.
0,"I keep reading these reviews that state that the Burger Bar has BLT gustatively defeated... and I just couldn't resist contributing my two (no doubt significant & highly influential) cents.\n\nAfter my first experience at the Burger Bar, I never wanted to go back. I ordered the sliders while the boy ordered the Kobe. I may have erred with the sliders, but they were so dry and tough...... no place should ever offer them on the menu if they so epically failed at making them. The boy's Kobe was alright, but it hardly balanced out the ick of the unsavory sliders."
0,"Regular visitors to Treasure Island and we always got these coupons for Kahunaville, so we've always wanted to try it.  Then we see a groupon for $25 for 2 yard frozen daiquiri drinks.  We had a vegas trip planned for the next week so I bought it up right away.\n\nCame to cash it in and the host was nice.  The bartender was super friendly!  It was great so far!  Got the Strawberry colada and a mango colada according to the bartender's recommendations.  It was a 5 star experience up until this point.\n\nThe drinks themselves...  Oh my god they were disgusting....  Like a thick sugary slush...  Even worse, they weren't even close to being strong.  I tried to just ignore the sugar and drank half the strawberry colada just because I wanted to get my buzz  (mango colada was so bad, we threw it away outright).  Nope.  It was so weak, just a sugary mess.\n\nWorst part is my massive stomach ache shortly after.  Had to leave my video poker machine and go back to my room where I had a stomach ache for much of the night...  I couldn't even fall asleep because of all the sugar!\n\nYARG!  Never again!\n\nPrice:  1 star  ($25 + tip) for 2 disgusting tasting frozen daiquiris?  \nDrinks:  -2 star  (threw away, BLEH)\nService:  3 stars  (friendly but recommended a shitty drink)\n\nOverall 1 star...  0 stars if your bartenders weren't pretty awesome."
1,The party starts as soon as you get off your plane. Slot machines all over the airport. Either go broke or win before you get to your hotel. It was very easy to navigate in McCarran. Everything was marked so you shouldn't get lost or anything. It was easy to catch a shuttle as well.
1,"My boyfriend's dad made us reservations here for the weekend (04/22/11-04/24/11) for my 21st birthday. All in all it was nice.\nThere was an older woman at the front desk with long curly hair that was kind of snooty and rude (she talked to use like we were stupid) but that was really the only bad experience we had.\n\nSince we only wanted to stay for a weekend we couldn't make our reservation more than 2 weeks before we were planning on coming (lame)\n\nThey offer free shuttle service to the strip every hour with the last shuttle to the strip at 12:00am and the last pick up for drop off back at the timeshare was at 12:30am. Most of our shuttle drivers we awesome. Supposedly no one is supposed to drink on the shuttle but none of the drivers care. (I was told by security when I was about to get on the shuttle that I couldn't drink but the driver told me not to worry about it :) haha.) The ride takes about 30mins especially at night cause the traffic is bad.\n\nWe stayed in a 1 bedroom, it had a kitchen, bathroom, washer & dryer, king size bed, dining area, living room with TV & stereo, and a balcony.  The kitchen came with utensils, blender, and the usual kitchen items.\n(See pictures)\n\nThey had quite a few jacuzzis (we had one basically right outside our room) & there's also a large pool but we never made it there. The jacuzzis are supposed to shut down at 10pm but we got in around 2am or 3am and no one seemed to care. I assume if you aren't loud and obnoxious no one will bother you.\n\nOh & every time the cab ride back from the strip was about $15, cab ride from the strip to Freemont St. was about $20, & the cab ride from Freemont St. back to Worldmark was about $25.\n\nWiFi is $4.99 per day or $15.99 for 10 days (I think) but for a place that people usually use for 7 day stays... that's pretty lame."
0,"Once again my son stopped in on the night of January 27 for Mint Chip for me and Chocolate for him. ONCE AGAIN this Baskin Robbins was OUT of Mint Chip, Chocolate Chip, Jamoca Almond Fudge, Rocky Road. Excuses, Excuses, Excuses!! Here's a tip to the owner SELL the store to someone who really wants to run the store, not own the store as a hobby. I will be reporting this store to Baskin Robbins Corporate. Do NOT go here unless you have your 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, or 9th choice. This is the DUMBEST way to run an operation that I have ever seen. Please stay away from this store until the owner sells or decides to finally get the staples of Baskin Robbins in on a consistent basis!!"
1,Well let me say that first off I place a lot of value in great food and ambiance. This restaurant made it for me. In a world of chain restaurants I treasure unique high-quality places to dine. One thing that bores me to tears is menus that all look a like. I thrive on trying different places. I savor eating different cuisines. I would go to this restaurant again. Kudos to you Chef Lionel!
0,"service wasnt too good and the food was pretty bad too. Open faced turkey sandwich looked just like a turkey dinner with a slice of bread under it, the mojo potato things were like a bake potato cut into big pieces. I would definitely not waste my money here ever again. The only good thing about this place was probably the broccoli cheese thing.."
1,"The bar is a solid 4- 4 1/2 stars. Gotta love how everyone can just fit right in no matter what their outfit.  As long as you're willing to have a good time Bikini is willing to welcome you.  An absolute 2 extra stars for their DJ!  When we went on Friday, we were jamming to some awesome old school, 80's metal power ballads, blues, independent \""chic\"" music and some imported editions.  All of this together blended perfectly to create the perfect background music - as diverse as it's clientele.  We went up to ask the artists behind a few of the songs because they were so good and he was more than willing to share information.  It was awesome how passionate he was about the music. \n\nI'm almost tempted to take away a half star for the drinks.  My friend got a Long Island that cost $6 and came in a super skinny glass with tons of ice.  She said it wasn't super weak or too strong, but it was too small for that price.  I told her they must be \""Scottsdale\"" charging for the mixed drinks to make up for the cheap beer I'd heard about - and saw on everyone else's table.  \n\nParking is a super pain - especially in this time of super construction  and/or if there is an event at Trunk Space.  Be prepared to be creative or do some walking.  It's worth the effort."
1,"Great food, great service, can get VERY BUSY at lunch with limited seating, but you really can't go wrong here.  Definitely get the app on your phone and you can get free food with each visit.  Bonus:  the chocolate cake really tastes like my mother's homemade version.  It's to die for!"
0,"We did not have a good experience here. The food was bland and the quality of the ingredients was low.  The server was slow and when we got the food to go sauce leaked out if the bag creating a massive mess. The containers just weren't able to hold all that bland flavor.\n\nIf a one star rating doesn't tell you to skip it, I don't know what will."
1,"I usually don't write reviews but reading the ones on this site helped me decide where to go, so I'm paying it forward. \n\nI haven't been to a traditional salon in FOREVER but I wanted to get a haircut and I didn't think my Dominican salon could handle it.  The salon is located in the back of the barber shop so you have to walk through it to get to the chairs.  Didn't feel weird at all though, all the guys were super friendly.  I booked a consultation first to make sure I would feel comfortable putting my hair in their hands. There were two ladies there, I showed them what I was thinking and they walked me through what the style would actually look like on my head.  They were very welcoming, I felt like I had known them forever.  Not the same experience I've had at salons in the past where nobody smiles and you feel like you're interrupting their lunch.  In the end I felt comfortable enough to make an appointment and I'm going back in a few hours!  Only negative was that they tried to talk me into getting a weave, or pieces, idk.  It's just not my thing. \n\nOther than that it's a positive environment all around and I'm looking forward to seeing how my haircut comes out!"
0,"Ummm wow.  I wrote a quick tip that said \""who cares about a rating, the biscuits are the business!\""... I was wrong! Let me explain why.\n\nFirst, the 3 hosts(why do you need 3 hosts?) told us that it would be a 15 minute wait. It turned into 30.  We didn't mind cuz all we can think about were the biscuits!  When we finally got seated it took a little while for our \""seafood expert\"" to actually come and take our drink order, but that's cool cuz all we can think about were the biscuits!  We placed our order immediately an then we expressed to her that we love and want lots of biscuits, cuz all we can think about were the bicuits! She says \""ok, there getting ready to pop out of the oven!\"" we wait patiently for them to \""get out of the oven\"".  Our salad comes... no biscuits, our dinners come.. still NO biscuits! We ask the food runner if we can get some biscuits, he says \""they're still cooking in the oven.\"" Ummmm STILL NO BISCUITS! \n\nWe seen several other tables get their biscuits as soon as they sat down.  I guess our waitress sucked ass, big time.  \n\nRed Lobster, your waitress, Porsche delivered the worst service in all history of waitressing, fire her ASAP!"
1,Really yummy spot my favorite rolls were Japanese Lasagne and Sams Volcano the spot is very clean and the staff very nice I would definitely return here.
1,"Tried Grand Lux cafe for the first time this past weekend and LOVED it! Yes, i do prefer the buffet experience when in Vegas, but I couldn't give this place anything less than four stars. And apparently everyone knows about it! It got pretty crowded around dinner time, but luckily they took our 12-person reservation. Yay!\n\nPeople are saying this is a Cheesecake factory ish restaurant, but in my two cents, it's better.  Best part about Grand Lux: BREAKFAST menu for dinner!"

1,"I agree with the below poster.  I like Giant Eagle because they have everything someone needs.  They accept double coupons, have fuel perks, and are just the local grocery chain.  Sometimes a store is hit or miss depending upon the location, but I am satisfied with Giant Eagle and will do my grocery shopping there."
0,"D\u00f6ner und Pizza essbar aber nicht schmackhaft. Um die Mittagszeit dauert es teils recht lange. Die wenigen Sitzpl\u00e4tze sind unbequem, der Laden sehr eng."
1,"Excellent night's sleep.  High-count thread sheets, fresh towels, a good air conditioning system that provides the right level of white noise for my tastes. \n\nI also recommend the burger.  It is as good as it gets for a char broiled burger, and the batter for the onion rings is one of the best I've ever had."
1,"This place has got great food for a very low price. Also the seats are extremely comfortable. The guy who runs the place is hilarious and has a great deadpan style of humor that I didn't get at first. He will customize a lot of the menu in front of you (I had a friend who asked for a chicken and spinache calzone, and he cut open the calzone and added fresh spinache right there and threw it in the over for a few mins) Would definitely recommend."
1,Visiting the in-laws for the holidays. They tend to visit the same 3 restaurants over and over. I took it upon myself to find them something new. We had six people in our party ages 5 to 75 and there was something DELICIOUS for each of us. The service was great; the atmosphere was delightful and the food was outstanding. It seems to be in a more industrial part of town and I was really questioning my decision when we pulled up but don't let the neighborhood or the outside of the building fool you. Eat there!
0,"Given the proximity to other very similar restaurants on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was terrible (though I went only a month or two after it opened, so that may have improved), they charge for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the food is pretty average.  If you are in the mood for this kind of food, go across the street to Kabul where the food is reliably very delicious."
1,A great place to go see some pretty cool animals!! Make sure to feed the lorrys during their feeding times. Its pretty cool. The Dragon World exhibit is really cool too. Tickets are pretty expensive. $16 for just the zoo and $31 for the zoo and aquarium.
0,"The person working there says the bathroom is out of order because someone stole the keys.\n It's $.50 for ice in your own cup even if your buying a drink in a bottle.\n She was rude and acted like she didn't speak English when anyone complained, but was fluent when ringing up others.\n SMH."
0,broth is too salty.  beef in pho not always fresh.  spring rolls are not very fresh. i've eaten here 10xs. go to tea light if u live in north phoenix.  i've given up on this place.
1,Very cute cozy place. Fast service during the off hour lunch. Food was a little pricy for simple foods but it was good and fresh.
1,"Despite the not so relaxing environment prior to massage, the massage itself was great! Maricel was very professional am gave me the deep tissue relief I was needing! Definitely recommend her."
1,"My last breakfast in Edinburgh before hopping on the plane back to Dublin. Was extremely happy I came in! The people were nice, and the food was outstanding. I had the full breakfast and for the price I thought it was loaded with food. All of it was very good too, not bland or a cheap tourist imitation. I really liked this place and was disappointed I hadn't gone in earlier.\n\nAlso, I can imagine that it's a pretty cool place in the evenings. They have live music every night and a ton of Scotch Whisky to try if you're into that sort of thing. Very cool place."
1,"Ok everyone was right.\nThis place is freaking awesome!\n\nThe VARIETY! WOW~! Totally worth for what I paid for!\nThe seafood part was the best! The shrimp were jumbo size and fresh, including the juicy half shell oysters! Could't get enough of it!\n\nI love how they had Korean Kalbi, it was extremely tendered. The sushi was pretty good, and ginseng chicken soup was legit! Tasted like my grandmothers cooking! The macaroons...wow where do I start! The quality of those deserts were way better than some of the bakeries I've been to. I've tried the Ramen & the Udon and they were both pretty good as well.\n\nBut the seafood man... that was the best thing at the buffet~"
1,"I have never, in the 20 years that I've been getting pedicures, had an experience like this. I had come to accept mediocre in the past...Lish goes above and beyond in EVERY WAY! Most importantly, they took their time, and actually removed ALL the dead skin. They are super friendly, highly professional, offer you a beverage when you arrive, and do a SUPERB job! I am super excited to have a salon like this close to home, they will be seeing me regularly!!!!! (this coming from someone who never posts reviews!)"
1,This place is consistently good. Fresh and Friendly. Helpful hint...Order over the phone and your lunch will be ready when you get there
1,Always good!
0,"Parking was difficult to find, there is no sign from the road that indicates where this place even is. They rush you in line to order your drink and/or food. I paid almost $12 for a coffee and breakfast sandwich and the sandwich wasn't even really that great. It was greasy and looked messy. \nThis place is pretty small so I can understand why it is packed, but it was not comfortable to sit and enjoy myself. The tables are super tall, so I felt like I was reaching up to type on my laptop.\nThe coffee was  at least decent. I got a caramel latte, except she made it iced, but it was still OK.\nI probably won't return to this location ever again."
0,"ehhhh. \ni've had better seafood. \nmaybe i'm picky cause i eat seafood at least 4 times a week. this is a typical seafood restaurant where very american-ized families can enjoy a dinner. \ni thought it was going to be more unique because i imagine the district to be a very hip place. but it was very mundane. nothing stood out at me. \n\ngranted, the food wasn't bad. maybe it deserves a higher rating, but i thought it was a bit overpriced for what was being served. and so that was a pretty big disappointment. \n\nso yeah, if you don't like seafood, you would really like this place!"
1,I was in town for business and badly needed a pedicure. My colleague and I went to this place and had a great experience for the money. \n\nThe place isn't fancy but for about $22 dollars they provide you services that other places would charge you 45 to 50 dollars.\n\nStaff very friendly.
1,"My friends and I are vegetarians that enjoy trying interesting vegan fare. We ordered a Thai bowl, Mexicali plate and the Dragon Wrap. The wrap was rather bland and tasted very raw, but the Thai bowl and Mexicali plate were flavorful and filling. The atmosphere inside the restaurant didn't seem that nice, but we ate outdoors in the back patio area which was very cute and relaxing. The menu is offered in both English and French, which turned out well for us since we don't know a lick of French. Overall an enjoyable meal!"
1,Nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot.\nReally enjoyed the Pacifico on tap ($4.25/glass) and the Nachos gustivo pequeno ($9.00 for small).\nA bit pricey but still a fun place.
1,"I have had some dishes here which were cool.  But hands down the best dish ever is the brown rice chicken wrap. When I used to live in LA, I would make this a must do each trip.  I get it with no advocado, my friends get siracha with it.  but just plain is so damn good."
0,Is there such a thing of negative review here it is. How this place got 4 stars it is beyond me. Bad bad bad food. We order fried rice and got white rice with soy sauce poured over it. Our food was cold and dry. Lemon chicken and sweet and sour chicken were the same deep fried crap! You should be ashamed of serving such crappy food!  Nice deep fried frozen pot stickers. Hope you go out of biz soon... finally my kid threw up his dinner.
0,"I am a bit baffled why everyone thinks this is such a \""great\"" place.  \""Give Buffalo Exchange a run for its money?\""  I don't think so.  The vintage section at Buffalo Exchange is almost as big as the whole store.  It's small, selection is limited, customer service is average and its hard to find.  I guess maybe if you visited once a week you could find what you needed, but this place seriously needs to expand its inventory before I would come back.  I was underwhelmed which makes me sad because based on the reviews, my expectations were much higher."
0,"Ran in here looking for shoes for my daughter and where able to find some.  Why they got only 1 star is because of the line and that all three cashiers seemed to have to all be at one register and helping each other.  Joanne, Elliott and another elder lady stood infront of register 4 looking confused as they tried to help a gentleman it wasn't until Barbara walked up that anyone thought to call for help.  The line had to be at least 20 customers long."
0,"My husband  and i have been to this restaurant several times along with our family , will NEVER GO BACK the food is very good the service is the worst !!!!!!  The last 3 times it has gotten worst , the first time we let it go the second time I called talked with the owner and told her how bad the service  was , my husband and I went there for dinner it was 8:30 pm we did not know they closed at 9 pm so the server was RUDE when she took our order I asked for some of the garlic bread and she said we may have some but they are old and we have had them all day ... REALLY like we want garlic bread that everyone has touched. When the food comes out, i ordered chicken parm, what a joke it was a bunch of old spaghetti with a piece of chicken on top it looked so bad that i did not even eat it. Although my husband's pizza was good . While we were eating they started cleaning the floors around us putting chairs up on table's while we were eating,  right next to us .The sever never checked on us gave us our check while we were still eating , we asked if we could have coffee and dersert she had attuide was SO RUDE!! So I called and talked to the owner the next day and told her what had happened and she was so nice and gave us credit and wanted us to come back so we did , should have never went back food was good the service was good Sterling was our server. With that said, it was my step daughters birthday and we had told him ,  wanted him to bring a cake with a candle which he never did .Had to ask in front of her for a dessert brought but  NO CANDLE charge us for the dersert which that's fine but no candle and did not ofter coffee , think he forgot took so long went and found him and said can we have check we were going to the movies . NEVER AGAIN. Oh and he had the check in his hand when I said for a third time it is her birthday can we get desert ? He was very nice and a great server but with that incident it was disappointing.  Really ??? Terrible......"
0,"I been here twice and it does the job but I found a cheaper place with better equipment, the tubs for self wash are on the small size, space is limited, you can't rise or lower the tubs as other places (again cheaper places) .  Eh I wanted to like cause its close to me but I will make a further drive"
0,Looks good from far but far from good.
0,"Oh where to begin...  When we first arrived we were seated quickly in a too tight dining area.  My husbands chair was up against another customers chair.  There is no way to maneuver to get to your table so forget getting up to go to the bathroom because you will disrupt the diners around you.  We started w/3 waters with lemon.  Our server brought the waters .... no lemon.  We had to remind him twice to bring the lemon.   \n\nThe 1/3lb burger is tiny at best, the meat is about the size of a slider but the bun is a regular size burger bun.   A Mcdonald's cheeseburger from their dollar menu is bigger.   So I ordered a classic burger w/mayo/let/mushrooms cooked medium, My daughter had a classic burger cooked medium well w/mayo/let  only.  My husband ordered the pounder and he ordered the \""best of both\"" with fries and onion rings.   My daughter and I opted to share a med. fries only.   \n\nMy burger arrived w/no mushrooms, my daughter's burger was blood rare and we did not get the fries we ordered.  The \""best of both\"" was mediocre at best.  The breading used on the onion rings has no flavor and tastes blah so they probably only use flour on them without any type of  seasonings.  My husbands fries were heavily coated w/pepper and appeared old so he didn't even eat them.  \n\nI did send both mine and my daughters burger back to be fixed.   It took a while for the food to be returned, I also did inquire about the missing order of fries.  The server said \""oh sorry\"" I guess I forgot to order them.   So about 15 mins. later and my daughter and I had finished our mini me burgers, we received fresh hot fries that had not been seasoned at all which was probably a good thing because at least they were edible, but again nothing special.    So all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone!!  It's also kind of pricey.   I received better service and tastier food at Smash burger and it's only a block further.   I will travel the extra block.   \n\nThis place may do better on the strip especially considering their higher prices and visitors would probably flock to it's doors not knowing any better.  But as local, it's definitely worth my time to drive somewhere where I will get better service and food for my money!!"
0,"Although the pastries were stale, we liked the location enough to approach them about hosting an event there for our group.  Booked it a month in advance, talked to them twice, was clear about what we wanted, they said they'd  be happy to stay open late for us considering the size of our group.  They cancelled on us the day of the event, the new owner claimed she had not been informed of our event, refused to honor the agreement made by her employee.  We moved our event to Dennys and spent several hundred dollars there instead."
1,"Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-)  I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy!  Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too!"
0,"some how this place is a \""shell\"" station, Its really a bodega/smoke shop that happens to sell gasoline. stay away unless you are out of gas or jonesing for some strawberry e-juice for your killer vape rig."
0,"Heard this was a really cool place. Friday night, got on guest list and didnt have to pay, bonus, arrived with about 12 people, no probem or very long line to get in. Entrance included 1 free well drink for women. Entered and was greeted by some costumed entertainers, they were neat. Room was, a little small, but cool looking. Went to bar and the female bartender was very snappy and rude. Tip, women guest should use male bartenders. Didnt really see the main performers that people rave about. Only Stayed about 2 hours after it opened. Crowded on the dancefloor, people not dancing. And I think some weird older, fat,  anglo man in nice clothes may have put some kind of date rape drug in my friends drink, so ladies beware!! Dont leave your drinks open around strangers! My girlfriend passed out cold after only 2 drinks, it was very weird, but she is fine. I will return and stay later to see the performers because most of th reviews say that it is a really neat place."
1,"Me and my wife ate here a few weeks ago,the food was amazing...the people were so friendly. You will love the serves, and the atmosphere."
0,"As chains go there is certainly a problem with the new location chosen for this franchise.  Should you wish to dine here on an evening or a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, finding a parking space in the parking lot will be impossible  Apparently the Holiday Inn Express has commandeered the entire parking lot for their Hotel and the parking lot is \""empty\"".  As for the staff, other than letting me know that Holiday Inn will tow my car, there is no other help to dine at their franchise.  It is hard to sample the food when you have no way to park your car safely or within 600' or their door."
1,"WOW WOW WOW!!!  This little hole in the wall is amazing!!  My best friends when I was a child were Orthodox Greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is Greek and she and her Mother make AWESOME Greek food.   With all of that being said, I'm a major Greek food snob and I have unreasonably high standards, as a result.  I have been to dozens of Greek restaurants over the years and a handful from Charlotte, NC to Columbia, SC and, hands-down...Greco is far superior to any other that I have been to.  The freshness of the ingredients, the flavors and seasonings, and the quality of the meat is just like my Greek friends have made me accustomed to.\n\nI visited Greco for a late lunch.  Even at 2:00 on a weekday, there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as I was waiting.  The decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of Greece beautifully.  It has a bit of a Greek Diner feel, which I LOVE!  The service was fast and friendly and I enjoyed watching the chef  (owner, maybe??) prepare my food...\""FRESH' is the key word in the title here.  I watched intently and everything was homemade (Tzatziki, Greek dressing, Lamb patties, etc).\n\nI ordered the Lamb Gyro combo with Lemon and Oregano Fries and a Peasant Salad.  The lamb patties for the Gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect Greek Lamb seasoning blend.  It's cooked on the grill-top to order (not made from greasy pre-fab mounds kept warm on a a spit).  This is real deal!!  The meat was moist, tender, and delicious!  It was served with housemade Tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita (I asked them to hold the onions).  The Tzatziki is made with yogurt, fresh shredded cucumbers, fresh herbs, and TONS of garlic....it's a flavor sensation!   The fries...OMG, the fries!!!  The most incredible seasoned fries I have ever tasted.  Tastes like traditional Greek Potatoes, but in french fry form (brilliant marketing move, BTW...everyone loves french fries!!).  French fries are fresh cut with skins, fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt, lemon juice, and oregano.  I will have dreams about these fries!  LOL   Last, but not least, is the Peasant Salad.  The Peasant Salad is everything that you love about a traditional Greek salad, minus the lettuce.  Giant wedges of plump red tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced seedless cucumbers (with the skin on), Kalamata Olives, and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.  Again, all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and hand-tossed with Greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.  Salad is served with warm pita wedges.   It was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge!  Salads can also be topped with their house-marinated Chicken or Shrimp or their yummy Lamb.  They also have a Vegetarian Pita made with Red Peppers, Eggplant, and Zucchini and a kids menu.  They also offer Whole Wheat Pitas for a mere .25 charge.\n\nPrices are excellent as well.  I paid $15.00 (Gyro combo with Fries and a Drink and a full-sized Peasant Salad) and I made two meals out of it!  BTW, the Fries reheat perfectly in the oven!  \n\nIf you are looking for heavy Greek dishes such as Pasticio, Baked Fish, or Leg of Lamb, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for delicious Greek quick dishes, this is a must-try!\n\nI can't wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it!!!   I must try the Spanikopita next time!\n\nI have a new favorite lunch place!!\n\nUpdate Oct 8, 2012: I have been back 3-4 times since my original review and the 5-star rating still stands!  The service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.  My Husband, Son, and Mother have also eaten here with me and they love it, too.  I truly can't say enough about the house-made Gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time!   We have also tried the Spanikopita and it is very good, too!  This is \""the\"" place for Gyros!"
1,"By far my favorite theater and a world better than the UltraStar in Suprise.  I am also a fan of Harkins and choose them over AMC every time possible.  The ONLY thing that they really have to stay on top of is the roving packs of RUDE noisy teens that think the movie theater is the place to show how smart (read obnoxious) they are.  \n\nSeriously, you let people act like that and you will run off people with lots more disposable income that will go elsewhere.  Please keep the quality high, and manage the atmosphere.  You have a good thing here, but stay watchful for whether or not Harkins keeps it good."
0,"UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.\n\nSo, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director."
1,"I enjoy a variety of things on the menu, and I like the approach to eating healthfully.  Unlike some of the other Fox restaurants, I don't think this one is overpriced.  Where else can you get quinoa salad?  I'm not a vegetarian, but I eat many of the vegetarian options because they're so tasty.  The \""TLT\"" (a fake BLT) is amazingly good.  And, of course, the hummus is one of the more unique takes on that dish you'll find anywhere.  The wine list is spartan, but that is a sacrifice you'll have to make for their good, healthful options.  Last, I know it isn't their fault, but be prepared to be annoyed with the Biltmore's ridiculous parking system."
1,"Checked out this place for the first time, since my girl kept raving about it. Really glad they let people stand up on the booths to dance. Looking forward to coming back with my bestie!"
1,"The 2 for 1 burger coupon brought us in. The delicious burgers and fries will bring us back! Burgers are all served a la carte at about $6 to $7 dollars each. My husband ordered a basic cheeseburger and was singing it's praises until he tried mine- the weekly special Kentucky Bourbon burger, which he declared blew his cheeseburger out of the water. SO FLAVORFUL! Brews Brothers- make this one a full time menu item!!\nWe ordered the family size fries to split ($4.99) and the portion was more than enough for two people. Fries are FRESH- you can watch the cooks cut up the potatoes! We added a cup of beer cheese sauce for dipping- YUM! \nThe variety of beers on tap was great- but we both agreed that there wasn't anything TOO unique (but since the tap seems to change frequently, I'm looking forward to seeing an updated list next time we visit). \nWe were in on a Friday night, and it was nearly a full house. But we ordered and had our food within 10 minutes or less! \n\nOne thing I will mention is that we were dining with our 3 month old baby and brought her in in her car seat (Hey- new parents need to get out every once in awhile!). There is only one \""regular\"" table. The rest of the seating is high top tables and at the bar. So not necessarily baby, kid or wheelchair friendly. \nWe'll definitely be back- but will likely arrange a babysitter, or come on a less busy weeknight."
1,"Un petit caf\u00e9 tr\u00e8s sympa qui fait aussi showroom, l'ambiance est d\u00e9contract\u00e9e, le menu est simple mais efficace, les prix sont plut\u00f4t bas pour le quartier, le service est cool et sympa . Cela change de certains caf\u00e9s branch\u00e9s hors de prix et qui ont tendance \u00e0 vous prendre un peu de haut parfois. Petit plus : une jolie terrasse \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re qui permet de faire une pause hors de l'agitation !"
0,"If this is a great Supermarche I can't imagine what any of the reviewers would say about a Whole Foods or even a Safeway.  'Mecca', 'House of Religious Worship', 'Taj Majal of grocery shopping', and 'Rapture' come to mind."
0,"The fact that I have experienced another AYCE type brazilian steakhouse the weekend before at Pampas in the Bay Area, unfortunately made me realize that this place was not all that great.  The quality of meat was just OK, and the taste was not too flavorful as I would have imagined it to be. \n\nThe service though was good.  They were courteous, and quick to serve the meat.  But, it took an hour and a half before any salmon came out.  The skirt steak was too thick, and I like it better a little crispy on the outside.  The ribs were good, but the top sirloin was kind of flavor-less.  The bacon wrapped turkey and bacon wrapped tenderloin was good of course because anything wrapped in bacon is good. LOL.\n\nI had to use the typical A1 steak house with a little bit of tabasco to add some flavor and spice.  The salad bar was just OK too.  I enjoyed the portobello mushrooms, and seafood.  But other than that, the salad bar was just OK.  \n\nOverall experiences was just OK.  Fancy place, romantic atmosphere, great two person band, but the food did not impress me much.  \n\nThe cappacino and tiramisu helped to replace the flavorless-ness of the food.  \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot really recommend this place.  Sorry."
1,"OMFGG!! SO MUCH FUN!!!!  I honestly never been to such a distinct club!!! So my group got bottle service and it was incredible our waitress was always there to serve our drinks the music was fantastic and the mini shows got us so hyped up and the music doesn't stop which is good as well. I had to thank the clubs security bc with in 10 minutes of sitting in our area my phone feel into a crack between the cracks of the sofa so be very careful of where you put your phone, anyways the next day the club security was kind enough to take the sofa apart to rescue my phone I'm so very thankful for that otherwise my vaca would have been ruined. All in all I def recommend this place my group and I loved it so much we wanted to go back the next night. We will MOST DEF be coming back to The Act. \n\nP.S drinks were expensive just like another LV club/bar but so worth it for the entertainment you get!"
1,"Still digging on this place. It is now under new ownership but that hasn't changed them in the slightest. \n\nI stopped in this morning got a wheat everything bagel toasted with butter, SUPER YUM! And a turtle praline latte of sorts. STEAMED CHOCOLATE MILK PEOPLE!!! \n\nIf you find yourself in the area give them a whirl. I haven't been dissatisfied yet."
0,"We used to love Grazie. We used to frequent both locations when they had North Scottsdale too. Our last 3 visits -YES we gave em 3 shots after a truly unacceptable experience- the service has been atrocious and the food average at best. No one in the place and dirty tables, no one to greet you and when you are finally acknowledged, a grunt to take a table. Waited again over 15 minutes for anyone to even give us menus. I don't know where their lovely daughter Sam has gone but she needs to return and rescue this sinking ship fast."
0,"Says WiFi included. But they only mean if you're in the lobby. Otherwise it either doesn't show up in the scan or its out of range. Room is big and mine is right near the lobby. But the whole place is old and dilapidated. Before this, i thought id stay here everytime i come for a week. But its better just to stay at motel 6."
0,"We like Longhorn, but not this location.  The service here is mediocre at best.  Tonight it took 10 minutes to order drinkes at the bar, 10 more minutes to get them and 10 minutes when we had to pay to go to our table.  When we go to the table, it was not ready for us to sit and we had to wait until cleanup was finished. When we eventually got the appetizer the bread, there were no plates around.  10 more minutes to get plates.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, there was only a passing similarity between the menu pictures and what we received. My Caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland.\n\nWorst experience in a long time."
1,"People  here are super nice, place is spotlessly clean and chairs are very comfortable.  Yogurt is also really good, lots of flavors, lots of toppings.  I'm a big tart yogurt fan, and they always have a couple very tart flavors.  Also have Marshmallow cream topping, which is my favorite.  Well worth your while, but bring your wallet, it's expensive!"
0,"Nothing special.  Had the Sicilian crust.  Not the type of pizza i want to eat again.  The place was crowded, lots of families.  I would go to Grimaldi's next time."

0,"Out of 6 sushi places we tried in Las Vegas this ranked the lowest. We ordered several rolls and they all fell apart when we picked them up with chopsticks. Their signature roll was lame. Other rolls were not impressive. The sashimi was certainly fresh so no complaints there. \n\nIf you want excellent sushi and want to pay less than at Nobu, try Little Buddha at the Palms."
0,"I didn't realize that ''Complete Petmart'' was now a PetCo.  I was looking for the hours for the Huntersville store online yesterday & noticed this new location.  I shop at PetCo often since, of the chain stores, they have the best selection of aquarium fish & supplies.  I was thrilled to see there was a new one so close to home--about time the Univ/Northlake area get one.  So we pile in the dog-mobile and head over today to check'em out.  \n\nUmmmmm......THIS is PETCO?  As in the national retailer synonymous with vast selections of everything animal-related under one roof???  This store is S-M-A-L-L  small.   I've seen larger pet stores in Manhattan (where smallish stores are normal).  This small-store concept would work much better downtown Charlotte or Midtown/Metro.  But in the 'burbs?  Just doesn't cut it.\n\n-- AQUARIUMS/FISH/ETC:\nFuggettaboutit!   ''Excuse me sir, when will  your aquatic dept be up 'n running?''  ''We aren't gonna have fish at this store; it's something they're doing in all their small-concept-stores'''.  \n .... innnteresting.  No supplies either.  The only aquatic life they carry are feeder goldfish.  So if you have a large fish that eats small fish for lunch/treats, then you're in luck.  Otherwise, keep it moving.  Don't let the wall of empty tanks with backgrounds taped to the front of them fool ya.  They won't be utilized (at least that's the plan at this point).  \n\n-- DOGS/CATS/FURRY FRIENDS:\nSlim selection of dog food brands other than those such as Science Diet and one's that can be found at places like Target (ie: PurinaOne).  It was slim pickings on some of the slightly lesser-known (yet no less ridiculously expensive) brands like we use--Royal Canin--and others such as IAMS.   I never pay attention to the cat section since I don't have one, but that selection appeared to be comparable.\nAlso, it appeared that a selection of merchandise for ''critters'' such as hamsters was non-existent.  Don't take me to the bank on that though.  Also another section I typically bypass altogether.\n\n-- TOYS/BEDS/ACCESSORIES:\nI will say that they shined in this area.  We were surprised at the selection of toys, treats, leashes, harnesses, etc.   They even had a few things here that I hadn't seen at the larger stores.  If you're in the mood to pick up your ''child'' a new toy or a tasty new rawhide after work one day, then this is a good option, especially if you want to avoid the ''big box'' lines.\n\nOh, and I was able to nab two mini \""_______ for dummies'' books - first aid for dogs for dummies and pet stain removal for dummies for only a buck each.  So they made two dollars off me today.  A banner sales day I'm sure!\n\nAll-in-all I'm very disappointed in this location.  It's entirely too small & cramped (a ''department'' consists of only 1-3 aisles).  The selection is inadequate.  And most importantly (for me anyway), no aquarium section.  Well ok, they did have a hand full of artificial plants.  So for me, I'll continue to patronize the Huntersville store.  I'll give'em an A for effort though."
1,"First of all, let me just say that I have yet to meet anyone, or even meet anyone that has met someone, who has even come close to completing the infamous 'Rose Street Challenge'. \n\nWhen I first came to Edinburgh everyone told me this was one of the first things any self-respecting local (or tourist) should tick off their list at the first available opportunity, but when you stand at one end looking down the long narrow cobbles you realise that it's just not going to happen. Which, in fact, brings me to my first plus point: for such a tiny little street there is a huge number of bars, gastropubs, caf\u00e9s and shops.\n\nThey're quite pricey in comparison to other parts of the city cente, as it's so popular with tourists, but it's abolutely gorgeous. My personal favourites are Seadogs (an amazing seafood and veggie place) or during the day the Garden Caf\u00e9 at the back of The Dome is great for a spot of lunch al fresco.\n\nBy day, it's bustling but in a cute village-high-street sort of way. By night, and especially on weekends, it's bustling in a more hen/stag dos starting off here for the night until a local points them in the direction of a club sort of way."
0,"Denny's is hit and miss. Growing up I had a wonderful local Denny's that served piping hot delicious food every time. Unfortunately, our first visit here will be our last. All 3 dishes served at my table were cold and the wait was excessive.  The waitress was very upbeat, friendly and put her best effort forth. However, cold food is unacceptable!"
1,"This is my new spot!! These ladies not only are fast but they do THE BEST gel mani in town. No for real they know not to touch the cuticle and to let the nail dry fully before going ahead with the next step. The place is small but its why I gave it 5 stars. The small location actually feels nice, personalized and it QUIET, like you can actually enjoy your wine and your pedi with out hearing 12 staff members talk over everyone else. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"
0,"Visited here for lunch today. I had been to the Bar Louie's in Kansas City previously so I felt comfortable enough to know what to expect and didn't felt compelled to check Yelp reviews before arriving. Had I done so, I wouldn't have looked completely confused upon entering since there was no hostess stand or the typical 'Seat Yourself' sign. I found a bartender finally who confirmed you could sit anywhere and picked a seat inside but along the windows to still see outside. The patio seemed nice but not enough umbrella's to shade the tables at the 1pm sun and the atmosphere inside seemed more like a sports bar with the TV's around the bar than the one I visited before. No big deal, just different.\n\nMy waitress arrived several minutes later and provided menus while I was waiting for the other person in my party to join. I was in the mood for salad and was excited to see all the varieties of salad options. I ordered an ice tea and eventually the orange brie salad with the $4 upcharge for chicken at the recommendation of the waitress. \n\nWhen my salad arrived, I was a little stunned. For $12, you usually get twice as much chicken and at least 30% more of a salad and other ingredients. As one of the other reviews stated, even my blackberries were cut in half and I got a total of TWO blackberries. Really?!?! In addition, I'd say there was about half an orange and maybe 5 small to medium chunks of brie. Not what I was expecting for a full salad that was expected to be my meal. This was just slightly larger than a dinner salad.  I will say that it did take me longer to eat than expected and I felt full when I left. Unfortunately though, 2 hours later I was hungry again. What a waste of $12. The ice tea was descent though but $19 for a small salad and ice tea is WAY overpriced. I could do better at McDonalds for a same sized salad and drink for $5.\n\nDon't plan on returning."
1,What else can I say but the BEST. Hands down.
1,"This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their 'steak that's not on the menu' for under $9.00, to the raved BBQ Baby Back Ribs, to their NY pizza joint. The food is abundant, inexpensive, and good. 'The place for the locals', the payouts are great, and the vibe is kickback from the craziness hoopla from the Strip. Their legendary karaoke room has been around longer than the fad itself. A strong recommend for any tourist who.wants something other than the Strip."
0,90 min waiting it's too long for someone has an appointment \nI wish I can give them 0 for customer service
0,"Lame! Lame! Lame!!!!! \nThe \""guest dj\"" Clinton Sparks or whatever, sucked!! He was playing 90's alternative music (Blink 182, sublime, etc). It was too dark in there for the small crowd. \nThey had rope ties for the imaginary lines and crowd they had, lol.. We only walked in cause we had the \""all access\"" wristband. But we left and went back to Moon that has real music playing that you could dance too- not mosh too."
1,"I have been there visiting my friend whose been at Coronado for almost four months,  Overall she has pretty good things to say about this facility.  I've always seen that it is clean and organized.  they seem to answer her questions pretty well and if I am there will respond to me as well with no issues.  \n\nHer major complaint is the food.  This is almost always the major complaint any health care facility.  When I have eaten with her, some days the food is better than others, so I can't disagree with her on that."
1,"Great place. I had a delicious pork sandwich with just the right balance of pork, sauce, and bread, crispy cole slaw, and a refreshing  sour beer called the smutty dog. More importantly, it had a great atmosphere. It's not the most crowded bar, but don't let that fool you. It's a great place to go for a relaxing time, a sandwich, and a beer."
0,"Wow. I don't know how this place has 4 stars. By far the worst experience I've had anywhere in my whole life. 6 of us walked in, several tables weren't bussed. We set up our own table and waited and waited and I finally just got up and picked up our own menus. After that, the server came by and took the menus because we wanted ayce and ayce was a different menu. After that she gave us 3 menus and we had to beg her for our waters. Lol. Gosh we should have left  then. So 45m pass and we only got 2 orders or shrimp tempra and 4 orders of albacore. So pissed! 4 parties walk in and got their rolls and I Asked her, \""why are they getting their food first?! We were here way before them\"" And she said because they were al la carte. Wtf!!??? I told the kids to get in the car and told her we're only paying for what we got. So I walk to the register and saw what she was charging us and she was writing the rolls we didn't get and I told her we never got those rolls and she can check the plates that  were still left on the table. Bill came out to 64$ and I still left 6$ tip. I def don't recommend coming here. Sooooooo stupid!!!"
1,"With most menus I stick to a few core items, but at Windsor it is a great idea to try a lot of new food. The staff does not seem able to miss when it comes to a single menu item. The vibe and decor is superior. Staff is well trained, polite and informed. This is another win for Central Phoenix. I can finally stop driving far for dining options because Central Phoenix seems to have it all as of the past few years."
0,"wow, where do I begin?  It took us an hour and a half to check in.  Our first room appeared to have been ransacked.  Beer bottle caps on the floor, the items from the cabinet were strewn all over the floor, beds unmade , towels everywhere, extremely dusty on the tables, a HOT mess.  The next room (which was an upgrade)  had been shampooed that morning, so the carpet was  WET....very WET.. tried to call the front desk and waited for over 30 minutes with no answer.  So, had to go back down to the front desk and  while they apologized, it took them about 15 minutes for them come back and tell us what we were going to receive.  (2 free buffet meals).  The service at the HOTEL in general was horrible.  From the front desk, the phone service, the waitresses at the pool, even the server at PRICE MARKET (the buffet restaurant).  The hallways were ALWAYS dirty.  This place is a hot mess. Yes, there are some perks... but geez, had to go through so much to receive them."
1,Excellent! I love the food (sesame chicken is the best) and everyone is extremely friendly.
1,"I'm bumping this place up to 5 stars because after visiting a bunch of other parks around the city, this is my favorite. First of all, it's the one where my kid always has the most fun. They've got so many different things to keep toddlers occupied and happy. Second, the hill. The hill makes for a great workout if you want to sprint up it a few times. If you want to take it easy, go for a leisurely walk up to the top and bring lunch. At the very top they've got an outlook with several benches and a picnic table. It's one of the best views you'll get of the southwest and you'll be able to see the Strip in the distance."
1,"Located right next door to Concordia, you can expect a lot of university students and people working in the area to be here on break, winding down after a long day, or in celebration of some sort. It easily gets packed over the weekends and since it is a small pub, it will be difficult to find seating. However, during the week, it quiets down and on most nights they have a good band playing. They also have a few TV's situated throughout the pub, so for all the sports-junkies, this is the place to be.\n\nThey have a decent food menu which includes hamburgers, wings, poutine, nachos, and various meat pie's, among others. The \""Rim Reaper Wings\"" are insane, just keep in mind that the way it comes in, is the way it goes out - BURNING. \n\nIn a nutshell, the atmosphere and service is great, it's chill during the week and rowdier on the weekends. Their beer hits the spot, though I would never think of ordering cocktails here, or at any pub for that matter. And a few items on the menu such as the Guinness or McKibbins burger are worth ordering, I haven't eaten here much."
1,"The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great.\nI had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again."
0,"So, their IMAX is not a full IMAX screen, yet they charge the full IMAX price.  We just saw Interstellar. If you go, bring a blanket. The movie was 2:45 minutes. We froze the whole time making the experience miserable. \n\nGo to Harkin."
0,Stop on the largest motorcycle ride of the year and they only had 2 bartenders for 1000 plus Bikers.  Won't be back.
0,"Went in for my first and ONLY time (won't bother again) for a french manicure with gel coating = $35\nIssues - mediocre manicure, and uninterested nail techs, and the TV was not on for entertainment/distraction... \nThe worst part to me was that they use UV machines to assist with drying the polish - for over FORTY minutes during the painting process! This bothered my eyes and my skin, as the machines become very hot and uncomfortable. When I tried to communicate my discomfort 20 minutes in, my concerns were brushed off."
0,"Very bland, flavorless chicken.  Tortillas are made to order, but also taste like nothing.  Website advertises the fact that all their restaurants have Cholula hot sauce available, which would have helped add some flavor to the awful meal, but there was actually none available.  Workers were not friendly."
1,"Wow! What an awesome, wonderful, beautiful experience. She was so sweet and excited with us to see our baby moving. We watched out sweet baby move for a long time on a large flat screen tv in a tranquil room with relaxing music. She really loved people and babies and made the experience so special for us. She even wrote the gender down on an envelope for us and didn't even slip :) we saw so many cool things and didn't feel rushed at all. I would recommend My Sunshine Baby to anyone. We did this on a whim and I'm so glad we did!! Definitely going back with our next baby :)"
0,"We attended Mission Community Church as a family for several months, but we will not be returning again. \n\nRecently, Pastor Mark sent out a warning on facebook, where much of Mission's attendees follow his page: \""Do not bring children to this weekend's service.  It's for adults only.  Take your kids to childrens' church.\""  \n\nThe problem?  My son has high functioning autism, and cannot abide the noise and activity in the kids' service.  He comes with us, covers his ears during the music, and sits quiety through the sermon.  No problem, no distraction to those around us.  \n\nSo, we didn't go.  Apparently the Pastor had some complaints about barring children from the service, and his response on facebook was this: \""I am not here for children.  I am here to talk to adults.  That is my responsibility.\"" \n\nHow very, very sad.  Downright depressing -- that the leader of a chuch would absolve himself of his responsibility to at least half of his congregants.  Are our children that unimportant?  Are they that expendible?  \n\nWhen I called the church to ask to speak to a member of the church leadership about this incident, the woman who answered the phone was very defensive and evasive, despite the fact that I was calm and very polite.  She asked why we didn't just attend the service anyway.  I told her it was because Pastor Mark specifically told us not to.  She sounded upset by that answer.  I asked again to speak to a member of the church leadership, and she said, \""I will pass this message along to them.  IF they choose to call you back, it will be within the week.\""\n\nTwo weeks later -- and you guessed it...no callback.  \n\nWe are now attending Central Christian Church.  When I called to ask about their policies for special needs children and whether children were disallowed from the main \""adult\"" service, a member of the church's staff called me back within an hour.  I was assured that our children, regardless of their needs, were welcome at any service any time.  We will definitely be going to Central from now on -- a church that welcomes congregants of all ages and abilities."
0,So. My car has synthetic oil and last time I had an oil change and the same car wash I paid 40 dollars....... This place told me it was 70 dollars.... For an oil change. None of them were friendly or could give me a breakdown of why its a 30 dollar charge. These people won't get my business again.
0,"I originally thought PH was great, and one of the only casinos/hotels in Vegas where I felt comfortable. Then I stayed there for several days and discovered that the staff is almost uniformly rude, the taxi line and valet are invariably backed up forever, and they charge for everything -- including $25/day to use the GYM! And on the weekends, their pools become the domain of college fratty meatheads who play football in the water to attracted the attention of all the trixies around them. Boob tattoos positively required. Yuck."
1,Came here after hiking at north mountain...I love that this place had a drive thru so I didn't have to leave me dog in the hot car...prob will be back again!!
0,"My friend and I went to Postrio on a recent trip to Vegas.  She had been there several times before - all good experiences.  After our evening there, I would never go back.  We were seated promptly (we had a reservation), but no one came to our table for 15 minutes.  Not to bring water or to tell us they'd be right with us.  Finally, our server came to the table and we were able to order wine.  10 minutes later, our wine arrived.  The server sat it on the table and said \""I'll be right back to pour it\"" and went on to take drinks and checks to other tables.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had herb gnocchi with wild mushrooms, a caesar salad, and peach gallette for dessert.  My friend did seem to love her classic lasagna.  The food wasn't horrible... just nothing special.  I've eaten better at popular chain restaurants and expected more from a Wolfgang Puck gig.  Oh - and, we were seated out in the mall part of the restaurant, which completely killed the ambiance I would like when paying Postrio prices."
0,"I will keep this short and sweet and to the point. 1. Their design is nice and what you may be looking for. 2. When they developed our website - they went over budget by over double what we said we had and fought us on the fact that we should pay up. 3. They never finished the site properly - they only did what they thought was enough to say the site was complete. The site is still not functioning with our forms and lead generation. Ben talks a great game at the \""sales\"" portion and then when it comes to the project management and making sure the the site is complete with customer satisfaction - they fail miserably. I will not recommend anyone and go out of my way to tell anyone my horror story.."
0,"What can i say about this place... STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!\n\nStayed there for SEMA show 11/6/14 - 11/8/14 and with in hours of checking in, our stuff was stolen from our room.  DOOR CAN BE SHIMMED OPENED WITH CARD!!  It is suppose to be a non smoking room resort so all that stay there smoke in the halls, stairs and everywhere...\n\nOh let me say something about the security staff, sr security unprofessional,  jr security interrogated us like we were the ones that stole our own stuff. Wtf...  NO SECURITY CAMERAS NEAR ROOMS, SO THIEVES HAVE A GREAT TIME.\n\nI also think they have some shady long term residents there, that probably stole our stuff, but we can't prove.\n\nAs for our situation we asked to be moved rooms which they gave us (wrost room than what we had), they would not listen to us when we asked them if they could actually give us a little bit off the room or comp us in any way.  Nobody knew who is in charge and the front office staff was unprofessional.\n\nWe actually decided to leave our baggage in our car as we cannot trust having our valuables left in the room.\n\nIF YOU LIKE GETTING YOUR STUFF STOLEN AND NO HELP FROM STAFF COME AND STAY HERE.  GOOD LUCK."
1,"Hands down best BBQ in Las Vegas, macaroni and cheese is out of control. If your in Vegas and want BBQ this is the place"
1,"What a delicious last meal in Vegas, all thanks to Archi's Thai Kitchen, I'll will be back! \n\nDishes: Fresh Springs Rolls, Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Pad Thai and Shaved Ice \n(Pictures will be posted)\n\nArchis has a VERY friendly waiting staff! As for the atmosphere, it has this vintage and inviting feeling like a house! It was nice enough so you didn't feel cramped. I would highly recommended trying the pad thai! Coming from NYC, and having a love for Asian cuisine this is probably one of my top two places. The shaved ice desserts is deceiving because it was not shaved ice. When I think of shaved ice, I think of Malaysian Ais kacang (ABC). This seems more like a type of ice cream but the texture is different from store bought brands. The shaved ice here is some type of ice cream topped with condensed milk and boba! I would still recommended this dish as well. \n\nThe only reason this restaurant did not get five stars was because of the Fresh Springs Rolls. Fresh Springs Rolls reminds me a lot like sushi.The steamed rice paper that wrapped the other sides is unable to hold all the other ingredients. When you pick it up everything falls apart making it very hard to eat."
0,"Used this company twice.  Once to redo our entire kitchen.  Some problems, but not bad and would have recommended them.  The 2nd time we used them, it was for two bath vanities and a linen closet.  The sales guy measured a built-in linen closet cabinet TWICE on 2 different visits (7 feet tall and 3 feet wide)\n\nWhen the cabinets arrived the linen closet cabinet was only 30 INCHES WIDE!  We called him and said we wanted a 'replacement' not a shrunk cabinet with spacers on each side which reduces the storage by tons of cubic feet.  He said they don't make 'custom' cabinets as we thought...they only came in certain widths.  We insisted on the proper size and he got angry and said \""OK, I'LL HAVE THEM MAKE A SPECIAL ONE FOR YOU\"" and basically hung up.  We will not recommend this company."
0,"I'm lost for words. I continue to go here because I have that Flock card. I get coffee about once maybe twice a day from here. It's close to my classes and I like the atmosphere for doing a bit of work. First, I think the food is way overpriced for their quality: sandwiches are soggy and blah and they use blah deli meat. As for the coffee... I don't know what to say. It's caffeinated. Sure. Other than... I avoid getting the espresso drinks (cappuccinos, lattes, etc.) because all of them taste the same, foam or no foam, and are super milky rather than decadent and creamy. The drink craftsmanship is nil. They, like everything else there, are overpriced for their quality. The coffee here isn't brewed to the point of acidity as Starbucks' always is, but it ranks fairly low in taste. Maybe Seattle has spoiled me. I do recommend the cold press though."
1,"This place isn't for the poor...as in people with poor taste buds because this place is delicious! Seated within The Mirage on the Strip, Kokomo's is definitely an impressive, fine-dining experience. Here's a link to the menu: \n\nhttp://www.mirage.com/restaurants/kokomos.aspx \n\nThe ambiance was very dark and quiet with music playing gently in the background. The waiter was extremely attentive without being annoying. The cranberry and bacon bread was amazing! I don't even like bread but this was something exquisite. My date ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup with a Puff Pastry Dome. It was definitely a larger portion than she anticipated but it certainly was amazing. I had a caesar salad with an egg-less dressing and crisp parmesan cheese ( I held the anchovies). We both ordered the 8 oz fillet, oscar topped. Definitely the best steak I've had in long time. Not the best I've had but what's wrong with a close second. We also had Washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special. I can't remember how it's made but it certainly was unique and tasty. This place is a little pricey. Just two of us came to a little over $200 for what I described above but you're in Vegas, everything is a little pricey. I wouldn't pay that much for USDA prime anywhere else. For that price you can get certified Angus beef or even Kobe. \n\nOverall, this is a great dining experience if you're looking for something more classy and quiet to take your date too while your in Vegas. I'm sad to say that I just heard that Kokomo's will be closing effective January 13th, 2013. I guess I'll have to find a new fine dining experience when I go back."
0,"\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" \nFrom the Cathay House of about 2 or 3 years ago, no less. I wonder what happened? Cathay House used to be a go-to for my friends and family, but somehow the overall quality has been declining, and this last visit made us realize that. \n\nThe dishes now have simple, fundamental issues with them, like very thick dumpling skin that sticks to the dish, and vegetables that are not very fresh and crisp. The tea was clearly oversteeped. The highlight of the meal was actually the tripe, which was very clean and had great texture. Have prices creeped up over the years? We racked up a $70 bill for what didn't seem like very much food, especially in between all the limp veggies and half-filled dishes.\n\nThe service and cleanliness have also gone downhill; where I feel like Cathay House used to clearly be the nicest dim sum place in Chinatown, I can no longer say the same. While the servers are fairly patient and accommodating as usual, one of our party observed that some of kitchen staff don't perform the required hand wash after a bathroom visit, and that they were talking on their cellphones in the kitchen! I'm not sure what to think, between being disappointed, and being hopeful that Cathay would return to its former glory, but I do know that for the first time we'll be looking for a new dim sum place."
0,"Oh no......my ice maker is on the fritz.....no ice. I google appliance repair in Vegas because my old go-to company have disappeared. Sears? Household name.....you can book online. Sounds good right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe guy arrives after a phone call to verify what type of ice maker , freestanding or in the fridge. Good guy , clean , polite and capable. On the website they say $70  for estimate. \n\nThe guy identifies a bad pump, this is where you have to trust your guy. New pump or can you clean out/fix the old one. What do you think he said? \n\nObvious . \n\n\""New pump and I've got it on the van\"" \n\n\"" what a surprise!\"" .\n\nHe then logs into his laptop \"" $506\"" says the guy.  \n\n WTF? \n\nThe pump is $225 plus labor, tax etc!!!!!\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nSo if you want to be completely ripped off by a company, Sears are highly recommended, this is not a dig at the repair guy, he just works for these clowns. The job was quickly completed and I now have ice but my goodness, I think I could have flown to the Arctic circle with a cooler, chipped some ice out of a glacier and flown home for less money. BEWARE."
0,"I've always quite liked the look of Au Bar but had never been as I'm rarely in that part of town. However, last night I went out with a large group (12) of people who had chosen Au for a meal. I like the green exterior and the leathery/wooden/plants-all-over-the-place interior. The staff were friendly when we arrived - so far so good.\n\nThe menu looked nice and is very reasonably priced. Several things tempted me but in the end I opted for a burger as I was pretty hungry. Unfortunately, the service was not brilliant. The waitress taking our drinks order managed to miss out a couple of people and the food took almost an hour to arrive. When it did arrive my burger was pretty dry and unimpressive. The chips tasted exactly like the ones you get in Burger King which I found a little bit strange... Other people's food looked fine but no one seemed particularly overwhelmed. As the last dish was brought the waitor asked if anyone wanted sauce, one woman asked for mustard and he immediately ran off to get it without so much as glancing around to see if anyone else wanted anything. I would have liked some mayonnaise to moisten my burger a bit but it was very difficult to get anyone's attention to ask for it so I gave up. (I realised on the way out that the sauces were on a counter opposite the bar so I could have just helped myself. If only I'd noticed that earlier...) \n\nAll in all, not a great experience. Perhaps Au just isn't very good at catering for large groups - many's the time I've been somewhere and thought it was great and then been again in a big group and thought the exact opposite.\n\nI think it would be a lovely place to go for a drink, the atmosphere was friendly and relaxed.  I won't be rushing back but I won't avoid the place either. Given how cheap it is, I would be happy to give the food another go when with fewer people."
1,"For the price the food is great value, portions are good and the staff are very pleasant. Great thing is you can finish off your meal with a Starbucks from next door."
1,"Hidden wine bar just off Charlotte square with a lovely selection of wine\n\nI really like this place, it is hidden behind Le Petite Folie in a beautiful building with a glass roof . The selection of wine is great and the staff are very friendly. The wines are in a huge display over the bar and there is also a little balcony area that you can reserve.\n\nIt seems very popular as an after work drinking place as it is full of businessy types from about 4pm. The food is distinctly average but not bad for the price.  Some reviews say its overpriced but I can't agree - the shared platters of charcuterie and cheese are pretty good, very filling and only marginally dearer that a chain pizza from round the corner. The homemade soup delicious too. I say give it a try!"
1,"FOOD: Everything I ate - Chicken Tikka, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Biryani, Mattar Pineer, Lamb Vindaloo, Mumbai Shrimp, and Garlic Naan - were all great. I drank a King Fisher (Indian beer) and it was pretty good, better than most American bottled beers. Mango lassi was good, as it is in most places. \n\nPRICE: It's about $9-13 for each dish, and $3 for naan. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Decently nice restaurant, not very much Indian decor. The music can get a little too loud. Right when I jokingly said, \""A belly dancer should come out and dance to this music,\"" one actually freakin did. A white one. It was entertaining and awkward. But when a little girl went to dance like the belly dancer, that was hilarious. I swear that little kid danced for an hour straight. \n\nSERVICE: The waiter, who I've seen at campus multiple times, was helpful and polite. \n\nSKINNY: This is the best Indian restaurant I've been to in the phoenix area. I'm going back for sure to satisfy my Indian food cravings."
0,Came in and really liked the decor. Decorated very festive. Chips were better than the salsa which was pretty runny. The guacamole was bland. My husband and I both ordered burritos. They were just ok. Nothing too spectacular and mine wasn't that hot. I did like their rice which was probably the best thing I had there. Server was friendly but seemed kinda lost and forgetful which was weird since we were like only the third table there. Probably won't be back to try again for you don't really get your moneys worth.
0,"Ok, I used to love this Savers. I really did. But my last 3-4 trips here have been nothing but a complete disappointment.\n\nSince I started coming here last year, the prices have gone up like crazy. If I wanted to pay $15 for a Forever 21 dress, I'd go to Forever 21. If I wanted to pay $15 for a Halo t-shirt from Hot Topic, I'd go to fucking Hot Topic (pic to be uploaded for proof!) Whether they like it or not, this is a thrift store, and if I wanted to pay the higher price I wouldn't buy it used. The ultra inflated \""like new\"" prices take all the fun out of thrifting. \n\nI've found an occasional gem here, and today I found a black slip that I needed and a Washington Capitals shirt for my better half ($3 and $4, respectively) but I would have walked out the store with at least 5 more items if everything was priced reasonably. There was also a lot of stuff I recalled from the last time I was here... 2 weeks ago. \n\nI subtracted a star for my cashier having an attitude with me because I pulled out my Savers card and it's \""not Thursday\"" (I don't really know how their card works since they don't, you know, TELL you when you sign up...) and I decided that I'll just drive the extra distance to my favorite Goodwill store in Silverado Ranch, where I have found Betsey Johnson dresses for less than Savers F21 or Charlotte Russe dresses. Just sucks because this place is close to my house. What a shame."
0,"Pizza is so-so, good hang out place just next door. Weird service.\n\nWent there today, had pear and walnut salad, that was good! The Lime Chicken sandwich was ok."
0,"For being in the Bellagio, the dishes were very sub-par.\n\nI live in the Bay Area, so I do speak with bias - I can easily find the same quality dish for half the price, within walking distance from my apartment in Berkeley. \n\nSome of the dishes were bland. Overall, the food was mediocre. \nThe price is reasonable - for Vegas."
1,"Je tenais vraiment \u00e0 oublier ma premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de la semaine pass\u00e9e, donc j'y suis retourn\u00e9e hier...

0,"Gave this place another shot with my wife.  Food was ok, good wings.  The crowd herr is very strange.  There is a very clear group of older aged regulars that make this bar uncomfortable.  My wife and I almost felt unwelcomed and witness people  being asked to move (and leave!) to make room for them. The layout is also strange and isnt very good for large groups.  Theres many other better options within a mile..."
1,Good spot for craft beer and wine.
1,First time here recently. Great place! Friendly bartender with good recommendations for beer. Terrific happy hour as well. I had the Prosciutto and Peach Flatbread which was easily one of the best flatbreads I've ever had. Will definitely be back to this place!
1,"Book & Stage I so badly want to bump your rating up to five stars but your spotty service is a line of orange cones on the road to a rating upgrade. The Book&Stage continues to be an excellent place to have a unique music experience in Vegas (hint: free and not top-40 crap) and an even better place to people watch. The bands booked here have always brought out a, how do you say it nicely, eclectic, group of people as well as the mix of people passing through on their way to Bond or Marquee. \n\nThe service continues to be mediocre at best, and I want to give the employees the benefit of the doubt and guess that they have been stiffed by the eclectic concert goers more times than they can count. I get it. But I tip well. So don't make assumptions that I'm going to stiff you, because your Nostradamus prediction will prove true if your inattentiveness warrants a crap tip. \n\nKeep on keepin' on Book&Stage and get some upgraded training for your staff!"
0,"Lousy excuse for a restaurant!  Don't waste your time or money on this place.  My fajita's were cold, my margarita tasted like kool-aid, my salad came after the meal, I would have complained if there was anyone in sight, the server was an idiot who actually said I don't know and then stared at me after I asked a question about a dish.  DISGUSTING!"
0,"::UPDATE::\nI have contacted the emergency vet and the owner, or anyone else, of Companion Animal Hospital has ever called them, despite what they say. It is also illegal in the state of Wisconsin to disclose information to a third party without the owner's consent. Which was very obviously not given.\n\nOriginal post:\nI hate this place more than I could ever possibly express. Their incompetence lead to my cat almost dying. I brought my cat in here TWICE and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. I paid for expensive tests and still nothing. I broke down one morning after my cat was peeing blood and took him to a local emergency hospital in a panic because I was terrified for my cat's life. They immediately diagnosed what my cat's problem was and proceeded to help him. They said if I had waited more than 12-ish hours to get him in, my cat would have died. If I could wish any business out of existence, it would be this place. They may be cheap and friendly, but they have no idea what they're doing. Please don't ever put your cat's well being in their hands.\n\nIn response to the owner: First, I'm the co-owner of the cat. The cat originally belonged to my boyfriend and now he is both of our's. Said ownership has even been registered with the city of Madison. Trying to discredit me by saying that my cat isn't my cat, is a terrible thing to do.\n\nSecondly, I have the paperwork stating that there was blood found in his urine when he was brought in. Which I'm sure the emergency vet would have informed this person if they actually had called. The paperwork of my original \""take home instructions\"" from the emergency vet even clearly states that bloody urine is a sign of my cat's disease.\n\nThird, the emergency vet did say that there was a blockage of the urethra that could have ruptured the bladder if not handled that day. I remember the conversation clear as day as I was told to watch out for further blockages that may occur. I was informed that if it became a regular issue my cat would need surgery to widen the urethra to lessen the chance of blockage.\n\nFourth and foremost, I gave my cat the amount of medication told by this vet. The vet actually gave me antibiotics because they suspected the problem to be an infection. Something that the emergency vet almost laughed at. So far every vet I have mentioned it to said that they don't understand why they would have prescribed it. The extra medicine brought in (which was mentioned on my negative review on Facebook) was Nature Calm and Cosequin. Nature Calm appears to be a calming nutritional supplement and Amazon is showing Cosequin as a joint supplement. It looks as though it is a moot point seeing has how the medication has nothing to do with my cat's disease. And, again, no one had called Companion Animal Hospital saying my cat was doing better. Both my boyfriend and I hate this business for what they did.\n\nLastly, attempting to slander my name by saying that \""vicious, graffiti-like attacks by third parties\"" is what is going on is pathetic. Again, I am one of the two owners of the cat. Not that it should even matter considering how I was there for every step of the way and was even the only decision maker at the emergency vet clinic. That would qualify me as a first party. This owner of the Companion Animal Hospital is clearly unable to provide an adequate defense of the situation and is resulting to name calling. The fact that the owner is trying to make this already traumatic experience worse is disgusting.\n\nI also have serious doubts that this person ever called my emergency vet and will be placing a call to the vet later tonight.

0,Worst place ever and so ghetto!!!Had my daughters party here and will never do it again!!Service was awful..Pizza was burnt and the employes had attitudes!!I will tell everyone I know to never come to this ghetto dirty place!!!!!!!I wish I could give this place no stars!!!!!DONT COME HERE!!!!!!!!!
0,do not deal with the salesman orlando. the other sales reps warned me about him. he is a liar and his sales commission goes towards his wifes drug addiction. we regret our decision to deal with that piece of shit
1,I love going to Delmonico's whether it's for cocktails or dinner.  I don't get to go often but when I do I love it.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is great.  I love their steaks but never hesitate to go for the scallops either.  I always start with the shrimp and it's always good.  We generally end with the chocolates and are never disappointed.
0,"what used to be awesome has been utterly crap for almost a decade!\n\nthe store and its warehouse feel sticks out like a sore thumb around brand/prestige boutiques which makes it laughable and head shaking worthy.\n\nthe clothing reminds me of what you'd find on plaza st-hubert and no offense to plaza st-hubert as i love the place but you have to admit, ailes de la mode simply has no business being in business anymore.\n\nthe only redeeming thing is probably the stockhomme suits as some doesn't look too bad.\n\nyou can do and find better than this store!"
1,I have attended the Pain Institute of Nevada for a year now and couldn't be more happier for the quality of care that I receive. The staff are very friendly and attentive to the patients and really want the best for them.
1,Good price for watch battery repair and super fast!  I stood and waited and it was done in under 2 minutes!
1,Tried some new things. Still great. Only thing is making a reservation might be necessary.
0,"The food is good but the service was terrible.\nIt was not busy but only one waitress working. She was doing a great job. Taking care of the 8 customers in the cafe and orders in the bar.\nJust not us. It was like we were invisible. Passed by our table twice. The cook came and asked of we have been helped. Got us our drinks and said the waitress would be with us.\n15 minutes later she asked if we needed drinks from about 30 feet away. We told her we had them and would like to order. She replied\""she would be right there\"". 5 minutes later we order. \nShe was talking and laughing with everyone there and even a take out order.\nMaybe we were in her blind spot?\nTerrible service."
0,"Dirty glasses on the table that were fresh from the dish washer, water that tasted of day old coffee, \""clean\"" coffee cups with wet stains in the bottom, seated at a dirty table, dirty flatware, flys everywhere, cold food and crappy service.\n\nAny restaraunt can have a bad day, but this many things wrong all at once suggests deeper problems.\n\nHow can anyone actually like this place?!\n\nWell, we will never go back and I suggest you think twice about going your self."
1,Almost as good as the one in Hollywood!
0,The worst food ! Food came to table brunt . The service was slow even tho the  place was empty ... save your money.
0,"I was so happy to see another station in the neighborhood.  I went in to fill up as I usually do at any station unaware that I was paying TEN CENTS MORE PER GALLON (than Circle K)  because I wasn't paying cash or using a Shell credit card.  Yes, there are signs on the pump but, really, who would think to look for such a requirement?  I've been buying gas for over 40'years and have never seen such a non-cash penalty.  I, and my children, their spouses and our friends will not be getting gas there ever again.  How disappointing and dishonest."
0,"We stayed at the Rumor for my bffs bday and it was a fine stay but we accidentally left some things behind in our hurry to get things tidied up .... and upon going back to ask if the stuff had been found (which should most likely be immediately after cleanup since they were the next people in the room) we were told it hadnt shown up as yet. We checked out yesterday. So why wasnt it turned in immediately after clean up? and I know that we left it because I didnt unplug my brookstone charger to put in my bag and no one checked the closet for the clothes that were there before we left. So this bums me out. I hate forgetting things when staying away from home but its even more sad that when you leave it at a hotel, then its just gone forever because the staff gets to keep it (or whatever the arrangement is for lost and found). So I had to post this comment here because I believe that the lost and found is as much of the experience as anything else we were catered to and if someone drops the ball like this, maybe something will be done to better serve from this aspect.\nThank you,\nTonya"
0,"Sahara is the story of why sometimes it's better to take a casino out back and implode it rather than let it fester.  Back in as little as 2005 this casino was a great investment for a room and a little walk.  The monorail, also a better deal back then, could get you up into the heart of The Strip easy.  \n\nNow it's just a pale imitation of better times in Vegas, and it feels more like Travelodge than say Bill's Gamblin' Hall.   And that place is next to the Bellagio for the same money!  I loved you Sahara, but you've gotten old."
1,"What a beautiful place to sit with friends around the fire and enjoy some wine and food!  The fish fish tacos got the group vote for the fav HH food.  The crab cake cake was tiny and not impressive.  Whereas the cheese plate was more savory with a little something for everyone.  If you are looking for a patio setting, then you can't go wrong here."
1,"Wow. You never know what you will find in a strip mall in Las Vegas. Thank you Yelp. The noodles were excellent. We had five different dishes.  The beef noodle soup, the chicken noodle soup, pork and mushroom with flat noodles, the spicy cold noodles Szechuan style, and the small pork wontons in spicy sauce. Wow. Flavor complexity like I have rarely encountered in the beef noodle soup. Bold. Delicious. The owners care. I am looking forward to going back."
1,Nice set up in here with the bar in a horseshoe type shape in the center and tables surrounding both sides of the bar.  Great place to watch a game- plenty of flat screens...\n\nI ordered the turkey club which had a weird name that I can't recall.  It was excellent- really good quality turkey and avocado on sourdough served w fries.  \n\nThe drinks are STIFF!  Get a stiffy!  Haha
1,"oh man! This is my Jam for sushi! Hands down! the service is typically good but if its a busy night bring your patience. but in regards to food, the amount, the cost & the presentation-impressive!"
0,"Fuck this place.\n\nYes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.\n\nSo the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. \n\nSo we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!\n\nSo we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.\n\nDoor guy says, NO!\n\nI say, \""You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in.\"" (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)\n\nDoor guy says, \""fine you can come in, but that one stays out!\"" (pointing to my friend)\n\nI say, \""Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate.\""\n\nApparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...\n\nHe then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?\n\nApparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.\n\n\""Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?\""\n\n\""Hello?\""\n\n\""Umm\""\n\n\""Yo!\""\n\nRetard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who \""got in\"" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. \n\nI then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.\n\nSo if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin."
1,"This was my first taste of Vietnamese and this was a wonderufl introduction to the cuisine. The decor is very modern and classy without feeling cold or unfriendly.\n\nI did like that there seemed to be a lot of regulars in the place which bodes well, to me, that the food will be very good. The service was a little indifferent but fast and competent.\n\nThe spring rolls were excellent and so far have been the best I've had. The bun was good, but after dining at Noodles Ranch, the bun there is better. The Pho was excellent; the broth was lovely and the cuts of meat were nice and lean and in the right size to enjoy without a struggle. The portions were very ample and my husband and I each got an extra meal out of them. The prices seemed very fair to me for how much food you get. I am looking forward to coming here again to try some more of their menu offerings!"
1,"The Queens Arms recently had a bit of a revamp and the place is looking rather good - it has definitely joined the ranks of decent gastropubs and left the days of being a 'traditional' boozer behind. The newly painted green exterior is inviting and I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped over the threshold; inside it's cosy due to the presence of a real fire and the books lining one of the walls are a nice touch. The menu is tempting and succinct: there are only a couple of choices for each course, so everything is well thought out, pleasantly presented and very tasty (try the fish and chips). My boyfriend is rather fussy when it comes to pubs, but this is somewhere that has us both satisfied; it's gastro enough for me and pub-by enough for him."
1,"When we are in the mood for some North Indian style MEAT we head to Tandoori Times.\n\nI've eaten at both Tandoori Times locations and both are delicious. My only complaints are that some of the dishes are a little heavy on the oil but that can be typical for some Indian places - especially those that are more Pakistani in nature and they do not offer much of a vegetarian selection.\n\nWe taken family and friends to this restaurant, some of which have never had Indian food, with great success. The food is generic enough for the American palette but still delicious for those of us that huff spices in our spare time.\n\nI've yet to try their Chaat on the weekends but I'm dying to do so!"
1,"I've seen all the Cirque du Soleil shows on the strip except Love. Le Reve is not a CDS production but it's pretty much the same performance.\n\nUpon entering, I was wowed by the round stage and the 360 degree seatings. How do they pull off a show with nowhere to hide behind the curtain?\n\nThe show's amazing, with all the acrobatic moves that's humanly \""impossible\"". It's still a star away from the O and Mystere but it's definitely worth the money.\n\nGo see it!"
0,"Pho is terrible. The slight taste of msg, less than at some places but no for me."
1,"been there once a few months ago for happy hour, enjoyed our cocktails & especially the malbec wine. we had 2 appetizers, the goat cheese one was good. can't wait to go back"
0,"After confusing all of the checks at our table, they demanded to see the IDs of everyone at our table as we prepare to pay and leave.\n\nConsidering the price of the beers and that their food is nothing unique, this is a place I will not come to again. It's one thing to mix up an order, but it's another to be carded twice after they make a mistake. \n\nAlso, their misters (which run even on nights that are not hot) absolutely drench the tables and everyone sitting under them. After multiple requests, the workers were unable to find a single towel to dry off the table."
0,"Had a car reservation for early Saturday. Waited over half an hour JUST in line!  They had a few folks working, but they weren't helping people.  When it was finally my turn, I asked if there were any upgrades.  She said yes, and told me the costs - and I said no thanks.  She said it was my lucky day and she'd throw it in, I was pleased until it came the bill time which I luckily asked for a copy.  On it she was charging me the add-on price!  When I asked her why - she said she had to charge me... I had to wait another 15 minutes for her smart self to remove it, and give me my original rental!\n\nCar was fine.  No complaints there.  Just the customer service sucked."
1,Great service. Would definitely refer this contractor to others. Very professional and great work. Affordable and very friendly :) only person I will trust with my yard
1,"On a mid morning Sunday, the restaurant was a ghost town. This normally is not a good sign and I almost darted. Heard that Elixir tends to be on the more expensive side, so my friend and I had purchased a Groupon Now before come here. In the end, we were unable to use it. If you purchase one to be used before 11:30am make sure to order breakfast, because it does not cover lunch. \n\nWe had ordered lunch, because their breakfast specials did not sound appealing. I had ordered the Lemongrass Turkey Burger on a grain bun($9.99). The juicy patty was topped with pickled diakon and carrots, lettuce, cilantro, cucumbers, and raw onions. All this talk about banh mi has got me subconsciously seeking out these flavors. It was absolutely delicious. Each sandwich comes with a side of chips and chunky mango salsa. For the price compared to quality, it was really reasonable. I would definitely come back for this burger."
0,"TERRIBLE PLACE! Got BBQ for 4th July and the worst I ever had.  Pulled pork was dried out and gross, the ribs undercooked. I ended up sick from it... Don't waist your money. This place is expensive and disgusting."
1,"I have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch (they don't do dinner). The waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars b/c they were all being called by name - nice touch. \n\nI ordered coffee (black), two eggs, country ham with biscuit and grits. The food came out in about 5 minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot. The menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local. The coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water. \n\nI love places like this, look bad from the outside, inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats, no frills, but the food was very good. \n\nPrice was right too. I will go back :-)"
0,"Ordered a juice & a burrito. Why it took 30 minutes, I have no idea. They weren't even busy. Won't be going back."
1,"I like most of the food here. We've been 3 or 4 times. I love the guacomole, but I will say some of my favorite mexican food options aren't on the menu. Prices are kinda high and service is hit or miss. I've definitely had better Mexican food, but we've obviously been back more than once.... so overall, good food."
1,"Their pizza and subs are great.  I would have given them a 5 star, but for whatever reason they totally got my last order all messed up.  I don't care though..... going back again to get the veggie pizza and hot italian sub!!!!  Totally laid back crew and delicious food.  Nobody is perfect :)\n\nGO!  GET SOME GOOD EATS!!"
0,"Went here for lunch ordered the special chicken Philly, the chicken tasted slimy and under cooked. After explaining to the waitress the she argued with us the about the type of chicken and the way it's cooked! Then took one of our plates back to remake sandwich and brought back old cold fries! Felt like she could of handled the situation more professional, so since I did not eat at all the rating is completely on service and the way my situation was handled!"
1,"I enjoyed my visit here. The wife and I decided to try it since we had a gift card. \n\nWe both decided on burgers since...that's what they do. They're pressed and no temps are taken - which turned out just fine. They have a decent beer list, and a bunch of drinks they're happy to make for you.\n\nI got beer, and enjoyed it.\n\nService was nice, attentive without being overbearing."
0,"For a chain, it sure is completely different than the location on S Eastern. The portions are smaller & the staff isn't as friendly... but i gave them 2 stars since our food came out really fast"
0,"As if the airport wasn't ugly enough and the layout both annoying and tedious, McCarran had to assault our eardrums the entire time we were waiting at our gate with loud pop-twang country dog crap.  And they chose the worst of it too.  I had to reattach my ears when I got back to Portland, because they pretty much quit on me and walked away with a suitcase after being subjected to that torture.  The passenger clearly on a ton of meth (don't ask me how the TSA didn't notice) following us around with her tongue out didn't help either.\n\nAt least the security was nearly empty and quick as a beat.  That was about the only good thing."
1,"Wow what a view!  My friends and I were down here for a 21st birthday.  Let's just say, their one-bedroom suite was wonderful!  Our room featured a hot tub, full kitchen, and two televisions.\n\nMy only gripe had to be the roughly 1 mile (yes I measured) walk from the suite to the parking structure.  Certainly a bummer when your friends have the vallet spot and you had to park in the structure and walk."
0,"THE WORST PLACE WITH FOOLS RUNNING IT.......\n\nI have been there on Wednesday for lunch, they had a buffet going on. Surprisingly there was no food in the butter and one server cam there and told that they are going to refill. we waited for 30 min and they did not fill I complained to the owner about it and though he is busy collecting the bill I thought he would also consider our complaint. but i think he is the leader of the fools and never bothered about it, we were frustrated and thought to leave and we noticed that he added gratuity to our bill. Then i corrected my opinion that he was not only a fool but also shameless person taking money for not serving. MY RECOMMENDATION IS NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE.....WORST SERVICE, WORST FOOD AND BEST IN TAKING BILLS AND TIPS."
0,The food did not taste great and my husbands order came out on the cold side. :/ We will not be going back as we were not impressed.
1,"So, after nine years of foot traffic, I thought it was time to clean the tile and grout that covers a large part of our home.  It's a lot of tile and grout.  I interviewed several people from different companies.  Only one got on his hands and knees and showed me an example of what it would look like when he was done.  Only one indicated that he was going to be the actual person to come and do the job promised.  And it was this one that I hired to do the job.  He was slightly more than the least expensive and a lot less than the most expensive. And WOW! I didn't remember how good my floors looked when they were new.  Noble Cleaners did a terrific job.  They were very careful when moving furniture and very conscientious about getting the promised results.  I highly recommend Noble Cleaners for tile and grout and carpet (they also did a good job on my large area rug) cleaning."
1,"Now that I've been here 3 times, I feel like a review is in order! Service has been hit or miss, but I'll let it slide until there are serious issues. Atmosphere is fun for groups or a date (although I'd warn it's a little loud - not the best place for conversation).\n\nDrinks: Freaking awesome. I've enjoyed most of the mojitos I've tried (particularly like the pineapple coconut \""paradise\"" flavored one), and I also really enjoy the sangria. I'm disappointed their HH ends at 6 PM, however. \n\nFood: I love the mix of spanish and new american tapas they have. The duck rolls, sliders, and mac and cheese are all favorites of mine although I realize they aren't spanish at all! I do think they do a better job of \""plating\"" the tapas here than Babreeba - for instance the beer battered shrimp come with a huge plate of assorted fried veggies. \n\nOverall a fun off the strip place to go. We went there with a group of 12 last night and got buzzed and full for $40 each with tax and tip. Not bad for Vegas."
0,"I'm a bit surprised by the positive reviews of this place. Yes, the beer hall atmosphere is nice, but when we went they only had 2 beers. 2 beers?! What kind of brewery only offers 2 beers? They had the signature OMB Copper and Captain Jack Pilsner. We both got the OMB Copper, which was just fine if not particularly unique. \n\nThe pretzel another reviewer raved about was nothing more than a Superpretzel Soft Pretzel that you can get from the freezer section at Wal-Mart, and the brat wasn't much more impressive. \n\nI could see how it might be fun to come here with a big group for a tour and tasting, but don't think I'll be back any time soon..."
1,"Our only lunch on this trip was at the Goat Post Tropical Grill on Buffalo Drive.  This is a small unassuming restaurant owned by a couple that serve as waiter (him) and chef (her).  The food spans both the Caribbean and Mexico, but we went with for the Jamaican beef patties, jerk chicken with spicy fries and Jamaican ginger beer soda.  The pastry shell for the patties was amazingly soft and the filling provided enough spice to keep them interesting.  The jerk chicken proved to be spicy, tender and bountiful."
1,I vaguely remember a mound... oops... mounds of meat... steak meat... my memory isn't quite well... something about cheese... three of them... provo? American?  Cheese wizard? I can't quite recall... sloppyness... I remember sloppyness... damn speellcheck all to h3ll! Please quit reading this revue... I think I'm steak and cheese wasted!!\n\nOn a serious tip... those who complain about the price are the same that have no problem paying $4.00 for McD's featured slop sandwich.

The business decision is to appeal to a large audience with financial means and discretionary income, and is the fastest growing format and the #1 format for out-of-home listening.\""\n\nSo I guess that means that us tattooed and pierced people are broke-asses.  I sure wish the IRS knew that and would quit raping me every pay period and come tax time.  Cause, they seem to think I'm made of money."
0,"I don't understand the layout of this place. With all the revenue coming into this city you'd think their airport would be more upscale and clean. I've seen bus stations that are cleaner. I fly Southwest a lot and it's pure chaos in the C terminal. People are lined up to get on in the same small place people are getting off. The main artery is a huge mess only further complied by the fact they put slot machines in the way. I'm constantly being bumped into and pushed coming and going. The TSA, as always isn't very efficient and as mush as they think they have line control... they don't. There is a a general lack of seating at the food courts as well.\n\nPro Tip: If you have a flight out of the B gates, use the upstairs C and D gate TSA and cross over. The B and A gate lines are always longer."
1,"Prior to my visit here, I was either traveling to Tempe to see my old stylist or taking my chances (I gambled and lost) at super cuts. \n\nTo keep the story short and sweet, my hair was a catastrophe. Do you remember dissecting owl pellets in elementary school? Do you also remember finding out they were just gross nests of mysterious, dryer-lint-esque fuzz, broken hair, and random objects? That was my hair. \n\nI just can't quit you, hair color. \n\nSince my hair had recently been black, platinum, red, and a vaguely purple color that isn't up for discussion, it was really damaged. I needed a cut and a corrective color session, stat.\n\nI brought in a picture of some victoria's secret model with \""bronde\"" (blondish brown) hair that looked soft and shiny and just angelic to the point of serious hair envy. Brooke asked me what I liked about it, gave me a straight answer as to the state of my hair, and came up with a plan.\n\nA couple hours and some fun, girly conversation later, my owl pellet hair transformed into the soft, shiny, gorgeous \""brondeness\"" that I wanted. Oh, and it smelled like coconuts and sunshine. Yes please. Needless to say, I'm very very happy and will be returning! Brooke, you're my \""hair goddess guru\""!! lol."
1,Jean-Marc's is definitely one of the best bakeries in Pittsburgh. I like to stop here after doing some record shopping. Their pastries are out of this world. The kouign aman and creme brulee are my favorites. The prices are great and the staff is very helpful. I've been to a couple of other French bakeries around the city and none of them compare.
1,At first I didn't like this place. I tried a few sandwiches and liked the Pittsburgh classic idea more than the actual food. I was about to give up when I tried the roast beef. It's my sandwich every time I go now. I'll be back.

1,"Attended the Grand Opening of Cafe South (I-77 & Arrowood Road)\nWhat a wonderful experience!\nThe western omletes are the best!  Grits are cooked just right!  Warm biscuits! and the Belgian Waffle was devine!\nWe're going back tonight!\nWent back to Cafe South for dinner - we had a 12 oz. freshly cut rib eye steak, baked potato, salad - and marinated chicken tips with candied yams and fried squash - Everything was PERFECT!! We have been looking for great place to eat and Cafe South is it - their motto is:\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION\n(and we were TOTALLY Satisfied!!)"
1,"Circo has become my favorite place to dine in recent years. When I heard that chef Massimiliano Campanari was leaving for Lavo back in April I was a bit concerned what that meant for Circo...\n\nThere was no need for concern. Our table of three dined last night, the ravioli and lamb were still spot on. It was only the service that was lacking. We experienced nearly a 40 minute lull between appetizer and entrees. I suspect the kitchen was backed up due to a large party of 20 that sat down before us. Fortunately, the meal was yummy enough to forgive this flaw, but I certainly hope it was an isolated incident."
0,"Not what I expected from a Vegas nightclub. My girls hustled a few bouncers into getting us VIP passes for this club on a Wednesday night. But VIP doesn't mean no line, VIP just meant a kind of shorter line but you still had to stand in line. A shot of patron was $13 plus tip. The dance floor was wayyy too crowded for dancing or walking and the light effects made me feel like I was gonna keel over from a seizure. Yeah, those stairs are a bitch on a girl wearing 4-inch heels, make sure you take advantage of that handrail."
1,I went in for an alignment thinning I would need a dealership to perform the service since I drive a high end sports car.  The service tech was nice and confirmed my hutch was correct but hoisted the car and tried anyways.  They gave me a full print out of what I needed to get done but didn't have the custom tools necessary to fix my Porshce.  I appreciated their help and customer service.  Thanks guys!
1,"If places got stars for winning my business, this place would have tons! Truth is, the burgers are solid, the cheese fries and fried pickles are good (any place that even HAS cheese fries and fried pickles is probably going to be a fave of mine), the beers are big, but nothing is the absolute best I've ever had. However, I love sitting outside RIGHT on the strip on a beautiful day, and getting in and out for parking/driving is a breeze... so, yeah... solid 4 stars!\n\nThey've started giving you the big beers in glass cups which I'm not a huge fan of, but I find if you ask, they'll give you a branded plastic one to pour into, and then keep (and if you're like me, you'll get 'service for 12' in no time :-) ) --- bonus is they are also dishwasher safe so far!\n\nSo go.... Go for the sunshine and beautiful outdoor seating in a primo location on the strip (anywhere else will cost you far more in food/drinks for such a spot)... Go for a burger, a big beer, some cheese fries, and some fried pickles.... I'll be sad when this place inevitably gets changed into something that charges more."
1,"This place is NOT for the faint of heart. It is very punk oriented, with walls painted black and decorated with skulls and various creepy things. The TV monitors are playing snippets of old horror movies mixed with 60's pornos mixed with creepy cartoons. You never know what you will see on the screen next. I've been here multiple times since I do like the dive type bars. It is darker inside here than it is outside at night,  so give your eyes time to adjust. Enjoy the punk atmosphere. Gotta try the \""ass juice\"" if you dare to venture here!"
0,"If zero stars were an option, that is what I would give. \n\nI booked on the site and called to confirm verbally. I received an email confirmation. When my flight arrived, there was no driver. I waited a bit then called the company. After being placed on hold for about 10 minutes, I was told that my driver \""was in line to park the car because there was no parking at the airport.\"" The dispatcher told me I could wait until he parked \""or go take a taxi\"". Seriously. She had no concern for my time, no apology for the poor service and frankly didn't care one bit about losing the business. \n\nNow that I'm reading the other reviews (I guess I should have before...), I see that this company specializes in poor excuses for leaving their clients stranded at the airport, but little else. \n\nThese people are just awful."
0,This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu.
1,"I visited The Edge salon for a haircut yesterday. What a great experience! Making the appointment was very easy and the front desk guy was extremely nice and helpful. I got a terrible haircut from somewhere else a few months ago and I needed a good fix... Emily was my stylist and she was very nice. She asked me questions and took her time to find what I wanted. She gave me a great cut and actually listened to what I wanted, yay! My hair looks great and I will definitely be returning."
0,"THIS HOTEL IS A HORROR!  I find it hard to believe that anyone who has ever stayed at a hotel before, (anywhere & any rating all the way from the Holiday Inn to the Four Seasons), would write a positive review for this spot.\n\nI have nothing but negative things to say...\nI will elaborate when I check out. But for the time being I will say that the worst part is that I paid & furthermore splurged on this, my vacation...something I haven't done in years.  It also happened to be my bday & it was ruined by the unprofessisonal and imcompetance of the linq-i missed a bday dinner, a concert and worst of all-good times & memories...ultimately, all this was was money & time flushed down the drain. They didnt take accountability either & blammed hotels.com...i have photos/videos/& record from hotels.com as documentation to prove this to be true. \nThe one star I gave is for brooklyn bowl, otherwise if yelp allowed for it, i wouldn't give one at all.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe entire day I've called to request a blanket that every other room has on their bed. I spoke with someone more then 5x. Each time they either ignored or forgotten about my request OR are they are actually incompetant, which I'm starting to believe to be the reason.\n\nA pool is advertised, there is no pool. It is under construction. \n\nThe room service only operates from 7AM-1PM. \n\nElevators are for the most part broken & don't always run...best option is to use the stairs. \n\nMANAGMENT IS COMPLETELTY UNQUALIFIED TO OVERSEE A HOTEL & WITH THAT, A NEW HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS...ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR  DESTINATION SPOTS IN THE WORLD.  I FEEL LIKE THEY OWE ME $ FOR WASTING MY VACATION TIME, THEIR FALSE ADVERTISING, INABILITY TO ACCOMADATE & UNHOSPITALITY.\n\nDon't bother booking anything but a standard room because they ignore requests and will put u in a standard room, which I'm assuming is all they really have...\n\nHORRIBLE.  DON'T LET THIS HOTEL STEAL YOUR MONEY."
0,"I swear I rarely have fun at Vegas clubs.. There's just something so douchey about them.. Honestly, I'd be more inclined to have fun if there were just two requirements filled.. Space to dance and good music (no, not your typical top 40 crap).. The crowd tends to play second fiddle in this whole scheme, but nonetheless the play an important factor in the big picture..\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling cuz I don't really have a lot to say about this place.. Other than the fact that they played decent music, had space to dance.. but the crowd was full of 46+ y/o people.. Not cool\n\nWomp Womp.. at least it was free"
1,"Where do you go when your washer and dryer break down?\n\nHow about Starcrest, which can boast it's own little \""study room\"" with two desks, four chairs, and free wi-fi?  That's right.  I like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors.  And no, that's not racist.\n\nThe washers are expensive--at least by my standards--$1.50 a wash, but they fit in more than your average washer.  Dryers are about 25 centers per 7 minutes, but are HUMONGONORMOUS, so all told, washing two loads of laundry came to $3 in washing and $1.75 in drying (all of it fit in that one dryer and i let it run for 49 mins).\n\nThe laundromat is clean and big, so that's a plus.  Also, the wi-fi network....is named \""Chuck likes Guys\""  Um, wow Chuck.  Thanks for letting us all know via internet.  We're very happy for you.  Seriously, perhaps a greeting card would've better.  I imagine Hallmark making the card, where the front would be a peaceful lake with the words: \""Life has some surprises.\""  Then the inside: \""Like my newfound attraction to men.\""\n\nBut since Hallmark isnt' yet that edgy, we have starcrest's wireless to make the announcements for us."
1,"I finally had the opportunity to check out Leroy Fox on Friday night, and I was not disappointed.  Since the weather turned a little cooler, we decided to sit outdoors.  The patio has a very nice and cozy vibe and I like the decor. \n\nI had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars for this review... so I will break it down individually. \n\nService: 5 stars - our server was friendly, professional, and on top of things. Way to go! \n\nAppetizer: 3 stars - we ordered the pimento cheese with grilled pita points.  The pimento cheese was a bit on the sweet side which I found a little odd... I would prefer a sharper or spicier flavor. However, the pita was on pointe! It was freshly made in house and had excellent texture & flavor.  I loved the pita but not sure I would want the pimento cheese again. \n\nFried chicken: 5 stars - I don't normally order fried chicken, but had heard good things about theirs.  I went with 1/4 North which consists of a chicken breast and wing.  This fried chicken is without doubt the best I have had in a long, long time!  When I bit into it, there was an explosion of flavor in my mouth... wow!  The crust was crispy and seasoned perfectly. The meat was tender and juicy.    They brine the chicken for 24 hours prior to cooking it and it was absolutely fabulous.  I am not sure what they put into the coating mixture, but it was yummy - I think I detected a hint of chili powder or cayenne pepper.               \n\nCornbread muffin: 1 star - I love a good home-style southern cornbread. Sadly, on my visit, the cornbread was dry and tasteless... it was about as appetizing as a piece of cardboard. I took one bite and was done. \n\nWhite pepper gravy: 3 stars - I am not normally a huge fan of gravy, but this was pretty tasty. They serve it on the side so it doesn't make anything on your plate soggy (which I appreciated). \n\nMac & Cheese: 2 stars - this was the most disappointing part of my meal and I wish I had skipped it. The mac & cheese was made out of Cavatappi (corkscrew) pasta which is ok but just not what I expected.  Also, they used a white cheese as the base. Not a problem, but I would have preferred a much stronger, sharper cheddar sauce.  Overall the cheesy sauce was just not very flavorful.  I was really expecting a more traditional southern mac & cheese like the casserole-style that my grandma used to make. \n\nWine: 3 stars - I had a sauvignon blanc for $7.50. It was ok but served at a little warmer temp than I would have preferred. \n\nBeer: 5 stars - I tasted the Cottonwood pumpkin ale and loved that it was served in a glass rimmed with cinnamon & brown sugar.  Yummy! \n\nCost:  3 stars - I think the prices are a-ok.  Overall, I think our tab came to around $50 for 2 beers, 1 glass of wine, an appetizer, and 2 entrees (before tip)."
0,"Went here for a business lunch because True Foods had to long a wait. Menu was a decent lunch selection but service was VERY slow, although it was not crowded. \nThe burgers and fries looked good but my order was messed up and in the interest of te and since it was a business lunch I couldn't send it back. However when you ask for no dressing on a salad and balsamic vinegar on the side it's a pretty basic request and you should not get a salad soaked in sweet calories filled dressing. Boo on this place. Too many other choices in the quarter to return."
1,Cool place.  I had it a 3-star and then changed it to a 4-star.  Great view.  Not extremely expensive drinks.  Pretty cool scene.  If you stay at The Hotel you get in free.  I would call in advance to try and get on some list.
1,I discovered this gem when I was there for the Yelp Summer Splash event and what a great place to have discovered.  The hotel is nice and clean and a LAZY RIVER.  Need I say more?  I'm in love.
1,"Not sure what all the complaining is about. I have been to Barrio Queen twice. First time was when they had just opened and will admit, it was a bit of a mess but the food was still tastey. The taco list was a bit overwhelming. But this time, my husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon and had a GREAT experience. In fact, because of my high alert due to the not so great reviews on Yelp, I paid special attention to those diners that were leaving (as we sat near the door).  I observed and overheard their attitude and comments to the host. I did not hear a single negative comment or see a single look of disappointment.  In fact, it was the opposite. Diners were expressing how delicious the food was with hearty \""thank you, we will return\"", \""will you take our picture in front of your \""barrio queen\"" painting?\"" and my personal favorite \""can we speak to the manager to let him know how great our experience was...our server was awesome!\""\n\nWe ordered the Pollo y Chorizo Tacos to share and they were yums! I would probably order JUST these and a house margarita - which were also very tastey. In addition, we order the Elote (bowl of corn, cannot recall the exact menu item name) and the mexican style fries that are listed on the appetizer menu, again, sorry I cannot recall and cannot access the menu on their website to reference. Our server was attentive and knowledgable, the atmosphere less hectic than the first time around and the menu has been refined to be easier to read and not so over-the-top as far as choices and number of items. \n\nThis may quickly become our new place for street style tacos and margaritas. We have to check out Taco Tuesday for SURE very soon.\n\nRun don't walk to Barrio Queen for a cool atmosphere, a refreshing margarita and some tastey Pollo y Chorizo Tacos!"

1,"Pretty cool punk rock dive bar. Jukebox is loaded with punk bands. Interesting drinks such as the \""Ass Juice\"" and \""Bacon Martini's\"". Cheap booze. Interesting video's playing on the TV's. I would go back!"
0,"This used to be an average at best Denny's, it is older, service is slow, even though it is usually empty it takes awhile to get food, but my family went to this restaraunt, because it was usually empty and we could get larger seats, and the owner gave a 15% discount to veterans and military. Then today I went in and was getting charged extra for sauces we usually get and then was informed that there is no ownership and that he did not believe in giving the military that is standard at most Denny's. The note read there will be no further military discounts given. That just struck me wrong, those 3-4 dollars you are giving back to those that fight for this country are really going to break your back. Just wanted to let it be known, the hostess said the new ownership keeps changing things and it is getting a bid absurd, chargin for a lot of things they did not use to."
1,High end hooters.  You're looking at the next generation of strippers and nightclub cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  I don't mind.
0,"Writing this review about 4 months after the night I went, which I will never forget, for a bad reason. I specifically told the waitress I had a gluten-allergy and asked if there was anything here I could eat besides the edamme (which I said if not that is fine i'll just eat the edamme.) The waitress  checked with the chef and came back saying I could get this chicken rice dish and they could do it in gluten-free soy sauce (she also brought out the extra gluten-free soy sauce in the bottle to show me that is what they were using.) So I trusted them in the fact it was the same sauce I use at home...but oh no. About 10 minutes after I ate I felt so sick. Someone must of used the wrong sauce or put the wrong sauce in the bottle by accident cause I was sick the whole entire night.\nSo besides getting very sick..(from whatever mix up...or lie..no one will ever know...) they do have good drinks at happy hour!"
0,"Decidedly average..  I had a green chile cheese burger that supposedly had some \""zing\""- but it had none.  The daughter had Mac and cheese that was obviously right out of the Kraft box.  Some people like that .  Other than some decent sweet potato fries, nothing to differentiate this place from any other burger joint."
0,"This. Show. Blows. \n\nI wish we had read reviews beforehand, because we expected a lot more from Vegas - free or not. I could accept a kitschy, fun, tongue-in-cheek show. But this is a bunch of  horrible songs lip-synched over a static-y sound system, terrible choreography, and groan-inducing one-liners. \n\nA bunch of pretty girls in glittery costumes is not all it takes to have a show. How much would it actually take to hire someone to come up with a decent script to lip-synch?\n\nAlso, the crowd is packed tight and shoves frequently, so, even if there were something to see, it's impossible to get a good view. If you want free entertainment, stroll the strip and watch the street performers. It's an infinitely better show."
0,"i don't even think it deserves that one star.  this place is just bad, bad, bad!  i guess i was expecting too much for $30 a night.  \n\nthe room was super stank with nasty stains on the sheets.  i know vegas always smells like smoke but dang...even the towels stank of cigarettes.  i could hardly sleep cuz the air in the room kept aggravating my allergies.  everything smelled like smoke...the sheets, the pillows, the blanket.  then at around 2:45 am or so, there was a knock from housekeeping at the door and they even opened a door since they heard no answer.  DAYAMMM!  who does housekeeping at 2:45 am?????\n\nthis one-night stay was enough to keep me away from this place forever."

0,"This Wendy's looks to be less than a year old, but it's not kept very well.  It may have been bad timing, but it seems like none of the tables were wiped up and the bathroom was super dirty.  When we came in, there wasn't a large crowd or anything... it's a shame since the inside would be nice if it was just tidied up.\n\nThe parking lot is very awkwardly designed.  You have to park on the side of the building and it seems like the drive-thru was the main forethought here.\n\nService was super slow and the staff didn't seem that friendly.  I only ordered a frosty and it seemed like the employee was pulling teeth when mixing up the oreos into it.  I still enjoyed the frosty, but it made it way less fun to see that the person making it was miserable."
1,"If you do want to come here, then ideally you want to come for a rugby game, simply because that is the sport this stadium was built to show and when you do decide to come you'll find it won't cost you much to do so even during the Six Nations.  You do get football games here, most notably for any European cup runs the Edinburgh teams might be having, but really this place deserves to be given the chance to show you a decent rugby clash.\n\nEven if you are not a great sports fan, watching a game at a stadium like this is not the same as watching it on the telly - it really is a completely different prospect.  Instead of being solely about watching the game it's all about the atmosphere and during Six Nation clashes the atmosphere really is electric.  On these days the stadium does deliver all it promises and if you get the chance to see a Scottish game here, do take the chance."
1,"I have visited Texas many times and of all the joints I have tried I have actually liked Rudy's the best!!! Now that they are in Phoenix I am doomed because I will never actually try to smoke brisket at home because I can get it here and it is just as good.\n\nHere is the good and bad with Rudy's. I keep buying the good and stay away from the bad. :)\n\nGood:\n- Moist Brisket. for those who don't know brisket has two parts, the flat and the point. The flat is lean and the point is more fatty(moist). guess what has more flavor? Yep the moist. \n- Turkey. Sweet mother of sea biscuits!!! Best smoked turkey I have ever had.\n- Smoked potato with moist brisket. They cook the potato in the smoker and then add cheese, your choice of meat(moist brisket is the right answer), sour cream, and butter. (This isn't healthy food so don't eat here every day. Remember moderation is key )\n\nBad:\n- The sides... I haven't really found a side that I like. The beans are ok, as is the cream corn and the potato salad. I really could use some Mac and Cheese. \n- The sauce... They love the pepper and it shows in their sauce. I have had much better sauces but they will do if you really need them. Hint: Good BBQ shouldn't need sauce. \n\nNow in Texas the Rudy's have Dr. Pepper in glass bottles... This Rudy's would have gotten the 5th star if they had that too. \n\nEither way try the turkey and the brisket with some white bread and go home happy and full. (Full because you remembered to get the potato stuffed with Brisket right?? Good)"

After I picked up my luggage, I called him and he was already at the terminal pickup.  The driver was pleasant, courteous, friendly and drove safely.  The car was clean and roomy.

0,"Apparently I arrived the weekend that the \""computer system\"" decided to \""crash.\""  When we walked into the hotel, there was a massive line just to check in. \nPeople were here for EDC mostly, some for the Pacquiao fight and for Garth Brooks. I heard of stories of people waiting almost 3 hours.  I personally had to wait 2 hours to get to the desk.  My horror story doesn't end with this.  After I was given my key, I lugged my bags to my room only to find out that it was already occupied.  I said, \""WTF, ok the computer messed up!\""  I lugged my bags back down stairs to the check-out counter to complain.  The clerk apologized etc. and I got a new room.  This second time; surprise! This room was occupied.  I was so damned tired at this point that I didn't care if they gave me the crappiest room in the house.  I asked to be given as soon as possible, fortunately by this point the supervisor intervened and she gave me a suite, some buffet vouchers.  and some drink vouchers.  I don't know if I'll come back to this place."

0,"This place is expensive! $7.00 for a 6\"" sandwich. Or the scam of a lunch special. You get a dinky 2 and a half inch sandwich and chips that cost extra with a small drink for $7.29. \nI decided to order the cheesesteak sandwich. The lady first cut my huge piece of bread and placed the ingredients in it. To make it hot she microwaved the poor thing for 1 minute on super power. In fact when she took it out of the nuclear machine it burned her hand. Once the radiated thing they call a sandwich was ready to eat the bread had that just microwaved hardness to it. Bottom line this place is not good on you pocket book or your taste buds. \nThe only good thing about this crap place is it is close to Subway and Raberto's."

0,Worst experience ever!!! I paid for an hour and left after 20 minutes. The lady working there was alone and took her sweet time in arranging everything as I was a walk in. She was way too rough and that was only my feet. When I told  her it hurt she laughed and continued to do the same thing. That's when I was like ok...I gotta go. I'll pay you and even give you a few dollars tip just so I can leave. Just awful! I'm shocked I'm not bruised up because of her.

I thought I would go outside the box and try the cheese whips (think the string cheese they put in Bloody Mary's), 2 year old sharp cheddar, and the Port Wine Cheese Spread.  Total cost:  $20\n\nThe cheddar tasted sweet (I know, weird, right?) and the cheese whips had an off taste and were just nasty, certainly not worth the calories.  The Port Wine Cheese spread was okay but nothing special.  I could have bought something that tasted the same at the grocery.  Disappointed.  \n\nMy parents love the Mousehouse and always stop on their way to Milwaukee and always get me the cheese curds.  I will be sticking to those from now on as they are tasty and fresh."
1,"Love this place! Our favorite local breakfast spot and we were so happy when they opened this location in Summerlin. We are always greeted warmly and seated quickly. The service is fast and efficient and the food comes out quickly. Always order the coffee cake instead of toast! It's delicious and so light and moist and served warm. \n\nI like the build your own breakfast skillet with the seasoned potatoes! I also like that they have vanilla creamers for my coffee :) \n\nAlways a great experience and the food is always amazing. In my opinion, it's a little on the pricy side for breakfast but everything is now a days."
0,I have come here a few times and each time has been hit and miss between items on the menu.\nService was usually decent.\nWait was usually long in the drive-thru.\n\nTonight was the last time though.\nI only went there because I got a coupon here and there.. no more.\nThe dude was rude on the intercom totally rushing me and being annoying.\nI get up there after waiting forever and he only gives me half the discount because he swiped my card before I gave him the coupon. He didn't tell me either he just tried to sneak it. I had already told him when I ordered that I had a coupon and he could have asked a manager for help. He was still rushing me out of there even more since he knew he was being sneaky.\n\nSo my wife got the 5 piece chicken tenders... I only thought it was chicken because it was labeled as such. It smelled like straight up chemicals. It tasted the same. Like urine chemicals........\n\nI wanted to get my money back but didn't want to go in there and I was just over it. I am pissed to have wasted $6 on chemical chicken and the loss of coupon though.\n\nThen I had 10 mins to shop at SuperTarget because Carl's Jr took so long and it was almost 9pm.\n\nDone.
0,"Due to an unavoidable emergency I recently had to cancel my family's holiday trip to Las Vegas. I realized I would lose my deposit of a 1 night's stay. I called the reservations number to cancel and was treated with the finest customer service, even expressing regret that we had to cancel our trip and inviting us to please come back soon. Within the hour I received a statement of the settlement of my cancellation. Unfortunately things did not go well from that point forward. The amount refunded to me was not correct according to the settlement statement and when I called to inquire about it, I got \"" Tanya\"" in accounting. Tanya refused to give me her last name and after requesting to speak to someone else or a supervisor THREE times- she continued to be rude and told me no one else could help me, refusing to transfer me other than to say she could transfer me back to reservations. (Obviously reservations wasn't able to resolve an accounting error.)\nI had heard this was a classy hotel and expected to be treated with basic courtesy- nope!! Just rude Tanya. Best wishes to you, Tanya. I hope that when you have a legitimate customer service issue of your own, you are connected with someone kinder and more pleasant than you to resolve the issue. The Palazzo should be ashamed to have someone so rude and unprofessional working in accounting. Check your credit card receipts folks- TANYA is processing them!!!!!"
0,"Customer Beware, check your receipt before u pay. False and misleading prices on the menu. They charge more without updating their menu. Once got caught, they didnt apologize for the mistake, instead they argue with me on how they have been charging the new prices for a long time. (ya, thanks for letting me know that I've been overcharged all these yrs!) will never go back again!"
1,"I came here on an early spring day to pick up a sandwich for a picnic after being suggested by a friend- I wasn't disappointed ! The choice of fillings was plentiful and the bread was fresh. You can make you own selection of fillings or choose one of their many combinations. There are indoor tables to eat at which looked nice and cosy and in the sun they place a few outside. Apart from its close proximity to the Meadows, its large windows allow a lot of sun in, and it's great to sit indoors and people-watch."
0,"Horrible customer service...had the owner yelling, put his finger in my gf's face. It's too bad he couldn't even look at my plate to see the hair on it. Never... ever go here."
0,"I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go."
0,"When I noticed my kitty starting to constantly, vigorously scratch her head, especially around her eye, I made an appointment for here.  Went to the appointment and waited for almost 3 hours before seeing anyone. Hearing all the dogs barking for that long terrified her that much more.  Then I finally got in waited some more, saw the vet assistant for only a couple minutes and again waited almost another hour before finally seeing the actual vet.\nNo apologies for waiting all afternoon, no sympathy or compassion shown for a sick kitty.  Felt like I just took my car in to the repair shop.  She was examined, had tests run and the vet comes back and says Chloe (my cat) has ear mites.  I asked how thats possible.  She lives in a clean house, never goes outside, my other cat is fine.  The response was \""I dont know, but she has mites\"".   3 different meds were prescribed and follow up was scheduled.   At the follow up, we saw a different vet who treated her better.  He explained everything to me, including pricing. I again asked about the ear mites.  He looked at her file and said she never had ear mites!  She just had a deep ear infection.\nHere's the kicker.  The first time she was brought in, she was so scared she had a little \""accident\"" in her kennel.  I grabbed some tissues and immediately cleaned it up.  I asked the assistant where a garbage can was, she took the tissues from me and threw it out and then charged me a \""medical waste disposal fee\"" of $4!  \nOverall, I would only recommend taking your pet there for something simple like getting shots updated or something very minor.  I want a vet who is going to get to know my pets and treat them more like a patient.  I won't be going back there."
1,I've eaten at Sushi Samba before in NY and I'm a fan therefore I did not hesitate to eat here again for lunch when I was in Vegas.  The food did not disappoint.  Sushi rolls were fresh and yummy.  We had the kobe and lobster.  My choice of cocktail raspberry watermelon was refreshing.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Pricey but definitely worth it.
0,"My sister and I stayed at TI for sister time. We stayed from 07/31/2013 to 08/02/2013. I don't know if it was  because it was mid week but the staff just didn't want to bother with helping us. Nobody was real rude or real friendly.  No bell hop service, the concierge really didn't want to stop reading his paper to answer our questions, no one at the pool to check just grab a towel and walk in. I take it back the bartenders at the pool were nice and the lady working at the Oxygen bar was very nice and friendly.  Besides those three people, the service wasn't great, which is kind of weird since it was so slow there.  \nMy biggest complaint is there are NO Coffee makers in the room, so once you stumble out of bed, down the stairs, through the casino, wait in line, and then you can buy a Starbucks coffee.  I took away a whole star for just that! \nThe beds may have been comfortable at one time, but not so much now.  They need new top mattress covers, they deep dips where other people have been. \nWe ate at a couple if places there.  The Kahunaville was OK.  The Coffee shop was expensive and sit at booth if you go there, the table chairs are horrible.  When we sat down the chairs sunk in and the table was just below our shoulders. So, I am thinking a booth would be better unless you are 6'.   We didn't eat at Senor Frogs... but did order a drink there... yuck and expensive.  that's all I have to say about that place.\nI wouldn't go back, there are so many other choices and in the same price range.  I didn't think the coffee maker would be such a big deal but it really was :(   \nThey do have refrigerators in the rooms, stock with your own booze.  A Coors Light bottle cost $7.00 and mixed is $13.00 to $21.00 each.  WOW.  No more drinks free if you are gambling unless you are playing with over $20 and a dollar min each bet.  I didn't see any servers on the floor this was the bar video poker rules.   Again it was midweek maybe that is why."
1,"Went here last night with my boyfriend & friends, we all are now obsessed! This place is great! The stand in line to order and receive a table number to sit at after ordering seems weird, but it's so Efficient! We went at 7pm (it was packed), we waited in line for about 20mins, however it went FAST. The staff is constantly bringing over samples for you to try, they take your drink order while in line so you can sip while you wait- lots of local drafts available and they even make their own triple sec and lemoncello! \n\nThe food is made fresh- and it's amazing! Every person in our group ordered a different burger and different style fries- ALL were GREAT! I ordered the shroom burger that has goat cheese and pesto on it and WOW! Best burger I've had ever. Parmesan truffle fries were mind blowing good!\nEvery person working was positive, nice and really wants you to enjoy your dinning experience there!\nAlso, a huge plus in my book is that they recycle and compost! \nWe will be back for sure. Well worth the drive from the West Side of the Valley!"
1,"So my brother and my best friend and I decided to have breakfast here. Was a bit disappointed that this location doesn't serve alcohol but oh well. So we walk in and request an outside table and were seated in a timely manner. The hostess seated us that had the tip still on the table and I thought that maybe she didn't see so I let her know oh the tip is still on the table and she had a bit of an attitude while telling me the server would grab it. The server, Amanda, came over to us and greeted us and we told her what happened. I wasn't that upset but I just thought it was kind of ridiculous. Anyways our server was really great! Bubbly and cute and super friendly. She even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! I love that! I guess it's company policy they leave the tip on the table due to bussers stealing tips. \n\nSo on to the food. I got what I always do, it's just a platter with potatoes sausage toast and eggs and it's always delicious. My brother got banana but French toast and Biola got regular French toast and it was fricking fantastic.  \n\nOnce again I'd just like to say how amazing our server was! Thanks Amanda! Also I hope you win that trip to Disneyland!"
0,"My friends and I got the bachelorette package which included the Ladies Night Course.  I'm not sure if it cost $80 per person or if it was cheaper through the package.\n\nCustomer Service was good, but everything else wasn't...\n\nFor the price it cost, the food sucked.  We were served champagne, fried calamari and fried cucumber, edamame, dessert, cabbage with dressing and other stuffed goodies on it, pretzel sticks with dressing, etc, and we had a choice of chicken, fish, or steak.  I got the steak and it was pretty dry and not delicious.  I couldn't even finish it.   Took it in a take-out bag but ended up tossing it.  What an expensive waste!\n\nIf you would like to try this place out, try to get reserved seating where you have a nice chair/couch scenery in the background.  This is located at the far back level.  We wanted to sit there but it was already reserved.  That location is nice for taking pictures.\n\nBathrooms are located outside of this restaurant.  If you're dressed to hit up a nightclub after, you will get gawked at and cat calls..."
1,"From May till August 2013 I was a guest in Tempe with my family and because my son was already a member of Lifetime I became also a member. Now I am back in Holland for a short while it is the biggest thing I miss here. What a great place is that to sport and to relax. 5 times a week I was there from half past seven till half past twelve and everything was always ok. Especially  \nRachel was with distance the best group trainer and with her it was always completely full in the workout class. I am so happy to come back in October next, because for me it was hunderd percent wellness !"
1,"Let's see, how do I want to review this?!\n\nThe quality of meat is definitely better than what I used to (Tofu Hut). There's also a lot more types of meat to pick from, granted it is $27 for dinner. Lunch is ~$18; I believe the prices went up since the last time I was there. There's not much for me to say about service because it really depends on who's serving you and how busy they are. I don't really have too many complaints yet. The restaurant is a pretty good size so I'm not too worried about making reservations unless you have a large party.\n\nThere's a lot of marinated meats (your typical ones like brisket and galbi) and a few non-marinated meats like pork belly and ribeye beef. They also have toppokki (spicy!) and steamed egg :0D. I'm sad that they don't have tripe :(.\n\nIt's definitely worth a try but maybe not too often due to the price. It's definitely a pretty good deal for the amount of different meats they have. It's just not a good value to me since I don't eat much and I only like certain types of meat. Voila!"
0,"I really wanted to like Jim's since it's close to home and we could use a good diner out here. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. My boyfriend and I just ordered standard breakfast-- I had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and we split hashbrowns. The pancakes were undercooked, the bacon was so overcooked it was basically inedible, and the hashbrowns were also too crispy. It was not a cheap breakfast by any means and the girl who brought us our food didn't even say one word to us. I've heard other people say they enjoyed their food but just from that one bad experience, I have to say I will not go back, no matter how close it is."
0,"Studio Movie Grill is a serious thumbs DOWN!!!  The seats are ridiculously uncomfortable and if you get stuck in the \""rolling office chairs\"" you might as well leave!  Sitting in those to watch a movie for 2 hours is torture!!!  I was excited walking in because the lobby area is nice BUT then we went into one of the theaters and I was appalled....you might as well show a movie in your office conference room...BOOOOO!  Never never never again."
1,"It's tough for me to give a place five stars. And I won't do it after one visit. Though I will be back to this place soon and decide then if it is deserved. This is a cute little place out in Henderson on Eastern where so many delicious restaurants reside... Went on a Sunday afternoon and this place was full.. luckily just one table left inside for my party of 5. Came just for something sweet.. got the Monkey (nutella, banana, etc) and the blueberry lemon one... forgot what it was called. Both were very different and delicous, though both dessert crepes. Owner and workers were very nice. Clean place. Will be back soon! Love crepes :) Oh did I mention they have a mimosa menu? yup."
0,"I was scheduled to stay here for 2 weeks, but decided after 1 to move to another hotel.  Called on a Saturday and requested a refrigerator before Sunday check in.  Then called on Sunday to confirm late arrival due to flight delay and requested a refrigerator before check in.  Arrived past midnight on Sunday, and guess what NO REFRIGERATOR.  The Air Con is extremely spotty - not sure why.  The light overhead in the bathroom is broken, so took shower in the dark, and even after telling front desk to fix it, nothing is done.  Also, needed to make the call to front desk on my cell because the room phone is broken!  I expected a comfy bed, but nope.  The mattress is like the ones you put in a baby crib, thin and not cushioned.  The sheet was too big for the mattress, so it tended to bunch up in the middle of the bed during the night.  The hotel staff really couldn't care less how this property is run.  The sofa seems were coming apart and to me, that's completely unacceptable.  I would have replaced that in my own home.  Bad service on top of  dated ugly decor (red granite, i had enough and left.  Sheraton Crescent charged $80, while the Westin in Scottsdale was $89.   So it was not even cheap!  One has a certain expectation of Sheraton / Starwood properties and this one is an EPIC FAIL."
1,"Greg and the group behind Haulin' Balls are great! I have hit them up a few times either at Khoury's or one of the food truck meetups around town.\n\nI like that they have different flavors for everyone and are always working on new things. \n\nI've had the Godfather (italian style, beef meatball), Zorba (greek, lamb), and All Thai'd Up (thai, turkey), and the Porky (BBQ, pulled pork).  The leaner meats are a bit drier than the beef and pulled pork, but the garnishes and sauces really punch the flavors to match the themes. The ingredients always look, smell and taste fresh (a happy five senses makes a happier meal, eh?). Make sure you get plenty of basil, it always seems to be so pungent (in the best way) and set off the rest of the food.\n\nI order them all protein style, so no bread for me, and the additional lettuce adds an extra freshness/crispness that really makes it for me. Meatball sandwiches aren't the lightest fare, but this is an easy and delicious way to alleviate some of the heaviness (especially in the summer!).\n\nThe sweet potato tots are tasty and their mac n' cheese is really a treat. I might like it with a little more crunch on top but, even as it is, you get a creamy, cheesy, and very flavorful incarnation of an all time favorite.\n\nAs the Haulin' Balls people will tell you... you need some balls in your mouth!"
1,"Barcelona Tapas is conveniently located down the street from my house so its great to go to when I am jonesing for some good food but don't feel like making the trek to the Strip and surrounding areas.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun, dark, and decorative.\nThe staff is usually excellent (If you come late and sit at the bar...Edgar the owner will come out and chill with you. He is awesome and so much fun to talk to (Last time I was there we talked about how tasty food is like porn for the mouth).\nThe food overall is wonderful...I highly recommend the following:\n-pan fried dates wrapped in bacon with a red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles\n-beef carpaccio with truffle oil\n-the lamb\n-empanadas (I prefer the chicken)\n-bananas foster crepe\n-sangria (red)\n-mango mojito\n\nThey have wonderful happy hour specials as well (half off sangria on Tuesday...I think). Its a wonderful place to take a date or a small group of people....its also kid friendly."
1,"Coming off our prior evening at L'Orignal, my friend and I wanted a dining experience that would be close to that standard.  The concierge recommended Bar & Beouf.  The restaurant, we were told by the hostess, was not typically open on a Sunday, but they were this evening with a 5 course prix frie menu for $45 (I think--I hope I'm not misremembering things).  The first part of the dinner was an amuse-bouche of salmon tartare (I think) on piece of baguette.  Very tasty, but not the highlight of the meal (then again, it isn't supposed to be!).  The next course offered a choice of salad or a cold pea soup. My friend got the soup and enjoyed it; I had the salad and enjoyed the perfectly ripe tomatoes.  Tasty, but nothing to write home about.  The next course were small tomatoes with this amazing (AMAZING!) mozarella cheese foam.  It was a delightful take on a caprese salad.  The cheese foam (seriously--that couldn't have been a block of cheese) was so light and the tastes were brought out in a way that the cheese alone wouldn't have done.  Our main entree was either a beef pot roast (sorry, I don't speak or read French, so this is the closest I am getting) that my friend ordered.  I tried it--it was delicious.  Perfectly tender and melted away in your mouth.  I had the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was a large piece of brownie with whipped cream and some ice cream on top.  I was so stuffed I couldn't finish the dessert, and wished I could pack it away for later that evening.\n\nBar & Boeuf was a wonderful experience.  The atmosphere is a tad cold, but that wasn't helped since the place wasn't that busy (again, they said they weren't usually open on a Sunday, but they had a large group eating in the one section of the restaurant).  The wait staff was very attentive to our table.  The tomato and cheese salad dish bumped this up to 4-stars for me.  I want to go back when their normal menu is in use."
1,"I hadn't been to this VI for a while but recently went back.  New management has really turned this place around.  I went in only expecting a mediocre meal and left surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal.  Had an omlet, pancakes and a piece of pie.  I normally wouldn't give a place like this 4 stars but I was honestly impressed with the food."
0,"I went in and was greeted and helped with making my order which was nice...BUT THEN i watched as every employee ate and still performed there duties! it was the end of the night so maybe they didnt care?? i was horrified as i watched the cook stuff his mouth with meat as he cooked my food and the girl behind the cash registar ate off her plate and packed my food...i couldnt even speak i was shocked! i swore id never go back, it was disgusting...and unclean"
0,Overpriced and small portions.
0,"This place is not very good.You get a 2for1 if you stay at TI which is all that it's worth, if that.  The food is cold and the only \""fresh\"" thing I could see was the pasta made in front of you with choices of sauces/pasta.And the poor staff are not happy.Our guy never cracked a smile even when we try to make a little small talk.At least we didn't have to walk far to be disappointed.Oh wait, they did have fresh fruit (kinda sorta) so that was good if you like melons and pineapple."
0,"I am originally from the eastern side of the states.  I am accustomed to Panera Bread. When I moved to Phoenix, I was saddened to learn that there are no Panera Breads in Arizona, only the generic Paradise Bakeries.  I had heard that Paradise Bakery is owned by Panera, but it is no where as good as Panera.  Their ingredients lack quality and it seems like you have to pay a lot more for the specialty sandwiches and salads than you would at Panera. I ordered the \""pick 2\"". I informed the lady taking my order that I wanted to stay within the $6.99 price (its more if you choose specialty items), but I was confused by the menu and I unknowingly ordered a more expensive sandwich.  \n\nWhen I went to go pay, they told me a higher price and I was confused.  The lady (Christine/a) seemed very annoyed with me when I tried to change my order. Over all, she was very unfriendly and she seemed like she really did not like her job.  I specified I wanted mayo on my sandwich, which I did not get and so I had to go back to the counter and bug someone for mayo (there was none laying out to conveniently take).  The guy I asked had to tell another guy that I needed mayo and they acted like it was some grand task. The sandwich was just a slab of deli turkey meat and lettuce on white bread. As part of the \""pick 2\"" I also got the Caesar salad.  It was a large serving but the dressing they used was horrible. This is not an isolated incident.  I have been to Paradise a few times before, and I have never had an impressive experience."
0,Although I have been coming to this place for more than a decade and I love the food it's like comfort food from high school. But the last time I was in and received the worst customer service. The people that work there are rude and do not put the customer first. It makes me sad that management allows their employees to be so disrespectful and not offer quality customer service. I work for an organization that provides ALOT of business to their restaurant and now because I have had such a negative experience it saddens me that this will not be our normal lunch place. Hopefully they can read these reviews and work on their customer service and I will try them again in a few months.
1,"This place it amazing! We brought our 22 month son to adventure around and we ALL loved it. There is so much to do, see, and learn here. Our son especially enjoyed putting the scarfs in the air chutes, the car tracks, and the tricycles. I liked the pool noodle forest the most. If you have kids, this is a great place to go on a hot summer afternoon."
1,"This place is amazing! Me and my husband recently moved to Henderson, and the ladies in the office of our apartment complex recommended we check out their buffet. She did not steer us wrong. This buffet was everything I could of dreamed of. You walk in, and you are in buffet heaven. The staff was all super friendly. Beer and wine are included in the price, you must try their hard pear cider that they brew in house. I wasn't gonna drink this night, but after the waitress told me about it, I couldn't pass it up. It is super sweet, and pink in color, and goes down pretty easy! Good thing you have an unlimited amount of food to eat with it! All of the food I tried was delicious. This place is huge, and I didn't get to try over half of the food, so I really hope we go back soon. Dessert was probably the best part. Make sure you save room, a lot of room. It took me over 5 minutes standing up there, staring at all the delicious looking treats. Who can pick just one? Good thing you don't have too! This is a great choice for a great experience off of the main strip. I am recommending this place to all our friends!"
0,"Never again, despite the nice atmosphere.\n\nMaggiano's across from the Wynn (corner of Fashion Show Drive and Las Vegas Blvd) is nearby and MUCH MUCH BETTER IN EVERY WAY!\n\nCanaletto was my choice for our Valentine's Day dinner. The setting in the faux Venetian square is very nice. We had a late lunch at their bar a few months before, and liked the lunch fare. However, the dinner experience was severely disappointing.\n\n- HORRIBLE reservation service. We were running about 20 minutes late for our 4:30 PM reservation. I called the restaurant 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation and told them we were running about 20 minutes late. I was informed that our reservation would be canceled if we were 15 minutes late. Not a common practice, but it was Valentines Day, so fair enough. I imagined that they were overbooked and trying to squeeze everyone in. We rushed through getting out of the hotel (my lady still finishing up in the taxi). We rushed the taxi driver. We practically ran through the Palazzo. We got there exactly 15 minutes late. The place was EMPTY. Yes- we were RUSHED to get there by the restaurant only to find that we could have just walked up and gotten a table! Needless to say we were not happy, and not a great way to start the evening. IN ADDITION, during the entire 2 hours we were there the restaurant was never more than 50% full! \n\n- \""OUT\"" of Dessert. It's Valentines Day. What is one of the favorite treats on this day? Chocolate! For dessert we ordered the Dark Chocolate Mousse. 5 minutes later we were informed that they were \""out\"". Keep in mind that this was at 6PM. The restaurant was 40% full and it was early in the evening. Simply NO excuse for this. There were no other chocolate desserts on the menu. We went to Godiva. \n\n- Food was 2 stars. Nothing to write home about. The risotto was over salted. The salmon was over cooked and dry. The calamari was so rubbery and tasteless that it might as well have been tire tread. The rest of the meal was just OK. Definitely more Olive Garden than what you would expect."
1,"The beef and turkey burgers are tasty here, but the standout is the best-in-Charlotte veggie burger. Service is decent and the place is big enough that you don't have to wait for a table. I hope it survives - i think it's a great addition to the neighborhood."
0,"Well....what can I say?\n\nI have heard about these dang cupcakes for years now. Then, one finally opens in Scottsdale. My 10 yr old neice and I get in the car to make the drive (talking the whole time about how excited we are).\n\nWe get to Sprinkles (which is in a horrible location) and walk in to order. It is the tiniest place with about 10 cupcake flavors to offer. My niece looks at me like \""this is it? this is what we have been talking about for months?\"" I sigh.... I know.\n\nWe get two cupcakes to go (you can only order in even numbers!!! WTF). We order chocolate chocolate and peanut butter chocolate. THE WORST CUPCAKES EVER!!! For $9 we get 2 cupcakes!!!!  .... We take two bites in the car and then throw the rest away. Horrible. We made better cupcakes from Betty Croker $.99 mix from Safeway last week.\n\nSo So So Sad! They should be ashamed of themselves!"
1,"The food was excellent.  I appreciate that, even though we ordered our beef cooked differently, the chef worked the grill to cook the well done meat in a hotter part of the grill so that everyone was still served together. Very nice. We had the Filet Mignon and didn't order any sushi. I wouldn't have had room anyway.  I strongly suggest paying the small price to add fried rice. It was delicious. We also had a nice conversation with the chef. He didn't stay locked into the flipping shrimp show, but showed enough that we knew it was there for the asking.  Only complaint - wait until we're done to bring out the mop bucket.  We'll be back though. The price was better than most Teppanyaki places and the food didn't disappoint."
1,"This was recommended by a friend to try when we visited Las Vegas, and she did not steer us wrong. Best tasting broth (I had the Tonkotsu) and noodles ever!  And the pork slices just melted in your mouth.  Wow!  Delicious!!  What a memorable lunch.  Unless you don't  mind waiting, I would recommend not going at noon as we did because there was a line out the door to be seated. Once the crowd cleared out and we were seated, it didn't take much time to get our food.  We'll be back on our next visit!"
1,"Hey! wait me! Outside is being dangerous so I tell you today why this place is god. This placed had cheap prices for road of ultimate size drink. Drink so bug that it makes neck tired long time. Also, bartender maked drinks in very cool style. They also have having many myriad of sexy flavor, my request to you today is the strawberry banana taste of ultimate for so good it make you want to practice buddhism in madaq tower all day every day of life of ultimate. Pro monster coach advice, be haveiong care when picking strongest shot they have on record, as it messed many of my firend coaches which made me LOL. Anyway, bad thing about this palce at present is that sometimes they long to take to make drink, and they no had no have no guitar shape/staute of liberty cup. Overall i like olverall 4/5baboo"
0,"My wife and I stayed at the Westin for 5 nights and they offer a $5 certificate if you opt to not have your room made up the night before. We did this 3 nights, so we had $15 in certificates. \n\nWe headed out on our last night on the town and we decided to use our certificates at the bar. I asked how much a beer was? \""$9.50\"" Fine, it was free money, but then my wife ordered a Diet Coke.\n\nI enjoyed my beer and my wife had her Diet Coke, which wasn't refilled once.\n\nWe got our bill and our waitress went to ask her manager and they said we could only use $10 of the $15. (It didn't say anywhere on the certificate that you could not use more than one voucher at a time) Then we got our bill. $4 for a small glass of Diet Coke!!??!!\n\nDear Lord! What a rip off place. What we thought would be a free quick drink turned out to be $6 after tip. Now I am not opposed to paying fair prices, but this was highway robbery. What should have been a wonderful start to an evening turned into a real bad taste in our mouths. A very big boo to Gazette, and Westin for housing them."
0,"Great location and outdoor seating was worth the wait.  The food was not! The scallops were done well, but not cleaned very well as they had sand in them. I ordered gnocchi which came raw. The pasta was raw and still stuck together. They replaced it with an order of ravioli. Unfortunately the pasta cook must have been new because these came out raw in the centers. Not worth the price."
1,"Another fun thing at the Bellagio (after the Fountains) that is beautiful, fun and FREE!  Each display varies by season.  I liked the one I saw in June 2009 better than end of March 2010.  An employee informed me that the garden peaks at certain times (a few weeks after I was there -- the tulip bulbs had just been planted) and that makes sense.  The gorgeous floral displays remind me of the Rose Parade in Los Angeles on New Year's day.  I've grown up watching it every year, so it's fun to see something similar in Vegas.  I bring my camera and take lots of pictures.  It's quite relaxing if it's not too crowded.  CHECK IT OUT!"
1,"if you're in the hotel or at the pool and want a quick, delicious bite to eat - stop in here.  we were only there for 2 days and ate here twice.  2 reasons. 1) the mojitos.  you can build your own and order them by the pitcher!  you can add fresh fruit - grapefruit, raspberries or old fashioned lime.  variety of different sodas and rums to choose from!  2) the salads.  i know, i know,. but they were so good!  day 1, i had a great shrimp caesar topped with the biggest shrimp that i have ever seen in a salad.  day 2, had a chicken salad with pineapples, cranberries and an awesome honey mustard dressing.  the salads were so good and so right in the 108+ heat.  partnered so well with the mojitos and the great pool!"
1,"Whenever I come to Vegas, I always visit this F21 store - the sheer size of it is impressive, and I love that they have an entire room of sale items.  The store is generally well-organized and neat, and the sales associates I encountered when I was here last week were very helpful and friendly when I asked for directions to the bathroom or the nearest open fitting room.  My only complaint is that the music was WAY too loud.  I'm 23, I like EDM, and I don't have \""old ears\"" yet, but even I had a problem with the volume of the pounding music that was playing.  My friends and I were exhausted after shopping in here for an hour, and couldn't wait to leave to get away from the noise!  Other than that, this store remains on my Vegas to-do list."
0,"there were 2 agents working with customers and 2 people in line. It took almost 25 mins before we got to the counter. Very slow check out process. They assume you will get at least the basic insurance coverage. Make sure you decline all coverage if you have your auto insurance. They also tack on roadside assistance @ $5/ day. They will keep saying it is required. If you show your AAA card, they will remove it. Cars they have are old. They have over 39k miles, and have scratches everywhere. Rates are cheap though."
1,"I just love going here!  You can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have!  \n\nSo normally I go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine.  Or I grab some sake, which I absolutely love and can't find anywhere else.\n\nIt's at this point when I hit up their deli for a delicious tuna salad sandwich.  It's so disgustingly good, it's sinful!  The people that work there are so nice and helpful!\n\nAll in all, just a great experience!"
0,"Well ladies and gents the paradise bakery story goes back at least 7 years where the real name Panera made generous portions and were customer health conscientious.  They used to ask you if you wanted chips or apple with your sandwich and now you get the generic bun.  Food is from scratch but they have cut back from almost everything.  This includes the sauce they spread to items.  Over the years, I've seen sandwich size getting smaller and price going up to service dwindling.  On our last visit, we've ordered half sandwich and soup.  My wife asked that if she can have a chip instead of the bread but was rudely turned down.   Where is the old Paradise/Panera bakery?  When you start losing customers maybe you will realize that making portion cuts, quality cuts you realize that you will also cut the foot traffic."
1,"Really good pizza. The sauce is a little on the sweet side but matched well with the crust and fresh toppings. Red onion, green pepper and pepperoni. The crust was not too think or too thin and the cheese was melted perfectly. The price is defiantly right by the slice or the pie. An added bonus is the free parking garage a block and a half away - and a great comic book store across the street."
1,"We love Weera Thai! We order from them frequently and their food is consistently amazing! I genuinely think they have the best Thai here in Vegas! Definitely try the Yellow Curry and the Thai Iced Tea! \n\nMy real reason for review however is how they handled a problem... I ordered a vegetable soup that was described as \""Mixed Vegetables in Clear Broth\"" when it arrived it was loaded with mushrooms. I can't eat mushrooms. I wasn't expecting mushrooms since they aren't a vegetable and weren't listed. So I explained the situation and Weera promptly refunded my credit card for the cost of the soup... \n\nHOWEVER what really impressed me was following that conversation they went online (I order online) and updated their whole menu with the ingredients to protect anyone with food allergies in the future. That is what I'm talking about people! Customer service at its finest! \n\nThanks Weera! Me and you are gonna be GOOD FRIENDS!  And I'm off to order some curry!"
0,"We've eaten here before, the former times during the dinner rush. Those dining experiences were 100x better than the awful service tonight. We arrived around 8pm tonight, we waited at our table for 15 min before our server opted to take our order. My biggest pet peeve (which is why I hate being seated in a back table tucked away from server stations) is being unattended for more than 10 min ESPECIALLY when it's slow! \n\nSo we finally get to place our order and boom server doesn't know the menu yet. Because apparently what I ordered was a new one for her. Above all, they came back confirming my order thrice, thereafter, one time another server confirming. To top it off, my order came out wrong anyways and our drinks never once refilled. At that point, I've succumbed to their poor service and decided I could skip a meal. At check out, we're asked, \""how was everything?\"" Glad someone else was with me to kindly pass a, \""it was great.\"""
0,"The service was horrible. I went in to ask for a table for two and the waitress looked at me, continued talking to her friend, and only after I asked again did she acknowledge me. After I was seated it took them a while to take my order, and by then I already knew I wasn't going to visit again. The food itself was mediocre, (might have been tainted by the horrible service). I would recommend going to Jardin Nelson across the street for good food and awesome service."
1,Best chocolate we have ever had! We were surprised at their lunch variety and everything we have tried so far has been excellent. They have fast service to get you in and out on your lunch break. They also make custom chocolate for special occasions and are quite talented. We eat there once or twice a week now. The chef is from England  and has amazing British recipes in addition to American menu options.
0,"We go to a local hotel for Christmas every year. The night consists of a dinner and a show in that hotel. This year it was The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. The restaurant unfortunately was Stripsteak. The restaurant itself is nice and seated us immediately upon arrival. The server was quick and responsive. The problems began whenwe ordered. There were a number of items including baked potatoes that were not available this evening. This had to be a major faux pas on the part of the order department but totally affected our view of the place. They must have used up all their potatoes making French fries because that was what they bring in lieu of bread. Their special this evening was prime rib encrusted with a horseradish mix. This my wife ordered the special and it was way below par perhaps being the worst prime rib she has ever had. Nothing to do with the mix, the food was bland and hard to eat. The steak I had was good though. We had Brussels sprouts, which were sliced and blended with bacon, which was tasty. The potato scarcity coupled with the tasteless prime rib assured that we would not be back to this restaurant. A steakhouse with out baked potatoes is just not right. I say dressy in how one should show up but that usually does not happen anymore. Some of our fellow diners were dressed up while others were in sandals and shorts. The short of it is this is a restaurant in a resort and really does not have to live up to any expectations. The management definitely is aware of this fact. Sad because we had higher expectations going in."
0,I definitely do not recommend this coffee shop. My friend ordered a decaf chai and ended up with a drink that was more like a vanilla steamer. The muffin I got was rock hard and stale. Their coffee is less than average and the service was slow. This one man (the owner?) yelled across the counter at a coworker and the whole atmosphere was unprofessional and really rather awkward. Save your money and your time.
0,Long long long wait in drive thru.  For hard freaking chicken strips.  Overpriced.  Overrated.  Food was either overcooked or under a heat lamp all day.   A waste of a good location they could put a better fast food joint.
1,Make up galore and more! It can be overwhelming but with the right associate it can be lots of fun. I actually came over to this location because they offer free makeup classes which I got the 411 from an employee there. Other locations have classes as well but this location matched up with my schedule a lot more. I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out to be a lot of fun. FYI it's best to not wear makeup while attending a makeup class. \n\nI was the only one who showed up so I actually got a one on one lesson! Tasha was my MUA teacher and she showed me some awesome tricks that I never knew. I'm pretty plain when it comes to makeup but now I feel like I could pull off a little more risqu\u00e9 makeup. \n\nSephora also has the color IQ machine which matches your skin color and it was way cool. I was able to pick from over 100 different brands and Tasha helped me narrow down to 3 that I wanted to try. I left with a bag full of goodies from what I learned in class and my everyday makeup. I would definitely recommend the classes and Tasha!
0,"Very disappointed.  \n\nThe place looked fun and interesting but it was all a let down from there.\n\nThe hostess was cold and standoffish.  Flopped our menus on the table and left.  \n\nThe waitress was friendly but odd about drink options, offered tap water and left.   \n\nThe menu choices looked dismal.  Lots of good options for drinks, But that's about it.  No burritos or fajitas.  Tacos and odd plates only. N waited forever and finally threw down a few bucks for the tap water we didn't drink and walked out.\n\nHeaded next door for a delicious meal and good drinks.  \n\nWill never go back."
1,"Fun place!  I just wish the wait on the weekends was shorter.  Yummy roasted veggie salad with pistachios and golden beets, yummy ahi sliders, chicken dishes and vegetarian options.  The wine list rocks too!  Great organic wines for CHEAP.  And the elixers they make in house are pretty tasty too!"
1,Aqui encontraras un servicio excelente! Very friendly staff and delicious food as well. Food is made to order in plain view which i always enjoy. I tried the carnitas burrito enchilada style and loved it.
1,"They have all the typical chinese/American dishes.  Great service.  It's my go to when I have a craving for chinese food.  Love the generals beef, house lo mien, house special chicken and my son loves the Mongolian beef.  Staff is really friendly, as well."
0,"I drove around in circles trying to find this place.  It's the kitchen of some bar on Rancho and Craig.  Anyway I ordered the standard \""house\"" fried rice which consisted of Pork, steak, chicken, and shrimp.  I altered the dish by omitting the pork.  In regard to flavor, it was exactly what one would hope fried rice would taste like.  Presentation, however missed the mark due to the measly 2 shrimp that were in the container.  also, I wasn't crazy about paying almost $9 for fried rice(I don't care what the size of the container is).  It took them forever to bring me my change like there was some obligation to give them a tip.  I don't think so.  Hell, you got $8.65 for rice, that $1.35 in change is going in my tank.  Overall, the rice was delicious.  I may try their lunch specials one day."
0,"O M G. I need to update this one fur-shure. It had been a few month's since having something from here. What the heck happened? \n\nI soooooo *proudly* wrote the very first review for this place and have been recommending them since. I too went the first time based on a recommendation. NOT anymore due to our last takeout order. \nTo be nice: It. Was. Bad. \n\nFour of us placed an order. The chicken enchiladas were diced up pieces of dried out chicken, rolled up in dried out tortillas, with a thick glob of cheap ass cheese, covered with the salsa rojo(so the menu says) which in reality, was canned hunts tomato sauce with some black pepper tossed in for good measure.Seriously, it was so obvious when I opened the container and \""that canned sauce smell\"" slapped me in the face. My friend who ordered the very same thing, claims to have been slapped twice. \n\nThe beef fajitas were a takeout dish full of peppers and onions (where's da beef ? Oh there it is, pointing to about four slivers hiding under the P&O's ) we asked for corn tortillas and searching through the takeout for them I said \""Oh who ordered papusas\"" NO ONE did! Those things, that were as thick as a papusas, were the corn tortillas for the fajitas. No thank you. \n\nGood thing we ordered back up tacos. They're always good. \nWRONG. Again, back to the *dried out * theme. Where's the garbage?\n\nEven the salsas, green and the red, WAYYYY off. \nI know places have their \""OFF NIGHTS \"" but damn. \n\nOne thing that has not changed, unfortunately, is the use of little plastic baggies for the condiments on the takeout orders."
0,Been here 4 times. Only got in 2 times\n Posted hours mean nothing. They close when business is slow. First meal they forgot to bring the bread with my meal. Had to ask for it. It came cold. Second time I got there 2 hours befor posted closing time. Bone fragment in my meat sauce. Could not order anything else because they shut down the registers after I had placed my order. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
0,"With a trendy name like Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, I was expecting a bad ass twist on the American burger or at least a darn good burger. The food was just barely ok and for the price I am disappointed. The burger was dry and the onion straws were soggy."
1,"My iPhone wouldn't charge after buying a new cord. I was calling around town and these guys gave me the best price. Headed over to Tempe Marketplace and the guy told me it was going to take about 20 mins....Did one loop around the place and 10 mins later...It was done! Good as new! \n\nGreat price, Quick, I definitely recommend this place if you need a repair for your phone!"
0,I've used Yelp for years and have never written a review before but our experience at the Cottonwoods Resort was so bad I had to let you all know. We stayed here on a rainy day and not only was it pouring outside but it was leaking inside the room - right on my pillow. When I reported it they offered to simply change the sheets. I insisted on another room but they had nothing comparable. Apparently many of their rooms had been flooded by the rain. They moved us to a lesser room and refused to make a financial adjustment.  Service was definitely not given with a smile. I was very unhappy and will never stay here again.
0,"We came here 12/19/2014 @ around 0630. This was not our first time and absolutely love the soda machine. We sit down and it takes a minute for the waitress to get to us. It is okay no big deal but what happened next was hard to believe. There was a full on fight between a male waiter and a waitress he was complaining about her messing up our bill for our table (we haven't gotten food yet). We were not even involved, he kept saying to the waitress \"" you are an idiot\"". So finally that's over and I hear from across the room from another waitress \"" IS THAT A REAL DIRTY DIAPER\"" the waiter then looks at her and looks at what is in his hand brings it to his nose and responds \""YES\"". This was the same waiter who was in the fight with another waitress earlier. He then proceeds to toss the diaper in the trash. Yep you know where is this going and walks straight up to where the food Is prepared and picks up a plate of hot food and brings to our table (same hand that had the diaper). I had eyes on him the whole time and never went to wash his hands. We regretfully can never go back for this reason."
0,"Absolutely the worst pizza i've ever had. With all the local cheap late night options for delivery i have no idea how this place stays in business. It takes a lot or me to really dislike a place, but Gus's, your pizza makes me want to cry."
0,"First off, we only ended up staying here because of an impromptu trip and needing a place to stay immediately.  The rooms are unimpressive and the atmosphere was ehh.  Only go to the buffet if you like macaroni salad and little night life.\n\nThe only reason this isn't a 1 star review is that we didn't get stabbed."
0,"Very upset with this place. I had the chicken pad thai and it made me sick. As I am culinary student, I had no hesitation to report this place to SNHD. I would not recommend eating here."
0,"The room was spacious and clean, but very overpriced.  The coffee was BAD.  I like that the servers take orders for the hot food in the so-called breakfast buffet so you don't have to stand in line, but when I arrived there was nobody there to greet, seat, and take my order.  It is also not included in the price of the hotel.  The location is great, but I will stay at a different hotel next time I'm in the area.  There is nothing wrong with this hotel except it is not a good value at all."
0,"The \""security guards\"" are seriously the biggest dicks ever.... The parking is horrendous and they actually TOW THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE DESIGNATED EMPLOYEE PARKING.  Go to south outlets... At least you know your car will be safe.  Security calls the tow truck drivers to tow their own people... What the hell?  They are rude and no offense, but if there really was a serious situation that would happen at the outlets,  they would be the first to Segway outta there and leave you stranded and helpless."
0,The hot dogs are straight up disgusting. They over price everything ($17.00 for 2 Michigans and a poutine not including tip) the service is mediocre at best. The food left me feeling disgusted and ripped off. **WARNING THIS PLACE IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE AND THATS NOT JUST MY OPINION...GO THERE AND YOU'LL SEE IT'S A FACT**
0,"This is definitely NOT the SF at Paris. Here is how our night went:\n\n1. Hostess seats us & tells us it's happy hour until close (1/2 off all drinks)\n2. Takes at least 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us\n3. By the time he showed up, we were ready to order drinks & food\n4. Our appetizer showed up before our drinks (3 small pieces of bruschetta haphazardly thrown on a plate)\n5. My drink finally shows up...my husband's is nowhere in sight. \n6. We had to flag down a manager to hunt down our other drink. \n7. The kid sitting at the table next to us put his retainer on a side plate & the bus boy threw it out. Chaos ensues. COULDN'T MAKE IT UP IF I TRIED. \n8. Dinner was mediocre. The serving sizes are half what they are at Paris, but the prices are the same. \n9. Bill comes (after we wait awkwardly for 15 minutes)...the server had all our drinks at full price & also decided to charge us for a slice of birthday cake & a sparkler that we never order. When we pointed out the non-happy hour drinks, his response was, \""Oh, did the hostess tell you it was happy hour? She's not supposed to do that.\"" ???\n\nBy the time they got our bill corrected, it went from $153 to $60. They were trying to charge us more than double what it should've been! Pretty sure we won't be returning..."
0,This location tries to put used/returned beauty products back on their shelves... be warned.
0,"Donuts are greasy.  Selection is limited. Employees and who I can only guess is an owner are very arrogant. FYI, putting bacon on a maple bar isn't original, putting cereal on a cake donut isn't inventive. Seems like someone over at pinkbox was watching the travel channel or food network one day and saw a segment on voodoo donuts in Portland and assumed they were the only person in town to see it."
0,"I really wanted to like this place since it is new and a family business. \nMy first day I walked in and a kid took off running from laying on the couch. A few minutes later some one comes out to help me. (I should of just took my stuff and went somewhere else after that) I dropped 2 blouses off and noticed they also fixed shoes. Came to pick up my blouses after the \""ready\"" date and only one was ready. I dropped off a shoe which I was told would be ready in a week. A week in a half later my boot isn't ready but my other blouse finally is. They say my shoe should be ready by Friday so I go Tuesday, still not ready. Long story short it took a month to get my shoe and every time I'd come in they would tell me it was ready and they were going to go pick it up. When it was finally ready they had a kid working the store who had no clue what he was doing."
0,ok. But it's a bit too pricey for what you get.
1,"I was a bit unsure of what to expect, since I saw reviews all over the map of this place. However, I was in the mood for Mexican, and this place was convenient since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time.  \n\nWhen I arrived - between 1 - 1:30 on a weekday, I was seated immediately.  There were a few other tables with patrons so I wasn't the only person there at the time. \n\nThe service was pretty quick and menu offered all the standard options on a Tex-Mex menu.  Chips and salsa were brought out immediately and the chips were good, but the salsa was rather bland.  I had to ask for the spicy sauce to pep it up a bit. \n\nFor my lunch, I decided to go with the Pollo Fundido, and I must say it was one of the better ones that I have ever eaten.  The deep-fried tortilla was nice and crispy, and it was filled with plenty of pulled chicken and covered in a creamy-cheesy sauce.  It was served with a side of rice.   I was happy with the meal and my service was good.\n\nAlso, I don't normally order soda, but since they had Mexican Coca-Cola, I ordered one of those. They taste so much better when they are made with real sugar instead of the icky corn syrup that sweetens American sodas! \n\nAll in all, I was rather pleased with my visit and if I happen to be back in downtown Matthews with a hankering for Mexican, I will definitely stop back in!"
0,"Coffee is fine, foo foo coffees are fine, pastries are fine, teas are fine, ambiance is pretty good with wireless and a nice selection of books to choose from, even location is pretty good. The problem, and it is a persistent problem with these people, is the service is terrible. Indifferent counter help on their best days, downright surly on their bad days. It's to the point where we won't even go in there anymore. Such potential...... lost to a crabby attitude towards the customers. If you want to own or work in a coffee shop then be ready to screw a smile on your face and show some positive energy."
1,"If you like Filipino food you should try this place.  I ate here several times while I was in Chandler. There are so many dishes that are good here and I don't even know the names of most of them.  What I did, once I saw how it was, was to go in after 6pm when they put almost everything on half price to move it out before they close and I just pointed to about 4 or 5 dishes like I was going thru a buffet line and get the smallest container of each item (except the pancit which I really love and get a bigger size of) and took it all home and eat it for the next 3 or 4 meals.  The chicken and pork were both good.  This is not low-calorie stuff so be forewarned it will fill you up!"
0,"I have been going to JCPenney for Holiday portraits for FIVE YEARS and this is the first time, at Meadows Mall they have told me we can only have ONE holiday background. Ridiculous! Our appointment was at 3:40pm and at this time I am drafting this review we are waiting in the lobby still - it is 4:22pm. \n\nWe just got out of the studio. The session was quick and I felt she rushed our sitting since we were an hr behind and other appointments were waiting. \nI like the coupons for the photos at jcpenney portrait studios but I wont be returning to this particular location.\nAlso sitting fee's werent free this month so for the three of us it would cost about $30 - that is about the same price as their portrait membership program which gives free portrait sittings for TWO YEARS. The woman who rang me up did not mention the portrait sitting fee's OR the portrait membership. VERY dissatisfied with customer service at this particular location."
1,I only go there for happy hour--$2 beer and half off small plates and apps make it one of the better (and cheaper) HHs in the North-Central corridor.
1,"Loved, loved, LOVED the facilities.  The locker room is really nice and clean, they have water and apple juice for you to sip on, and they have these these amazing pools (hot, medium, and cold) which i jumped from as I was waiting for my massage.\n\nThe massage was...meh, hence reason the 4 stars rather than 5 stars.  The massage room was okay, a little small and not as relaxing as I had hoped for.  Oh well.  The facilities more than made up for it.  The massage and mandalay spa was just what i needed before I went to rehab at the hard rock!"

1,"This is a great find!  We have heard about it for a long time and after going there one night with friends -- We had to go back!  The owner/chef, Pete I believe is his name recognized that we had been there the week before and came to our table to say hi.  He was very friendly and made a special request of homemade meatballs. They were amazing and Huge.  Veal Parmigiana and a salad with goat cheese was enough for two. Great local place!  I hope it does not get to be impossible to get a reservation though! BIG PORTIONS."
1,Great breakfast. The best biscuits anywhere!
0,"I must look like a sucker. I needed a USB to micro USB cable and the guy says \""oh yeah, he gots one\"". Total price was $22.69 out the door. For a lousy 3 foot cable. It was retractable. But I should have walked over and picked a cheaper and BETTER cable. \n\nAs soon as I plugged it into my LG 11000 it put a message on the screen saying this cable is not recommended for this phone. OUCH! Not only do I get ripped off, but the cable is crap.\n\nI have had few good experiences with Radio Shack and should have gone to Fry's."
0,"The staff is rough as all heck. Unprofessional and unfriendly and unwilling to bag your groceries or do anything to go out of their way.  Other Lowe's are way more courteous, clean, and approachable  Convenience and speedier check out is the only reason to shop here."

1,"If you're looking for the most decadent of shoes, stop here, stop now. I own two pair, both bought from here, and they are incredible.\n\nThe selection is large, but getting a shoe in your size is the hard part. I suggest not going in with any preconceived ideas about the shoe that you want because most likely it won't be here. That's been my experience in the several times that I've been here. Just go in to look and try on and choose there. It will save you heartache and tears. \n\nThe shoes are beyond pricey, but they are the least expensive anywhere on the strip. Saks, et al., will charge you more for the shoes than CL actually will. It's bizarre, actually, but take my advice and save a few dollars.\n\nThe people in the store are going to be snooty, they sell an incredible brand, I just wish they would remember that they're in Vegas. I don't condone snootiness anywhere, but I expect that much more in Paris than some strip hotel store. Also, it makes the shopping experience that much less exciting when you're being looked up and down. And trust me, I go in with a very expensive purse and clothes every time. It doesn't matter. The snotty factor is high in that store. \n\nI will give this store a lot of credit; they have a huge selection, the shoes are all the latest styles and the store just makes you want to shop and shop. Beware of attitudes and lack of inventory and you'll do well here!"
0,"Really bad! Trash and toilet paper all over the balconies and pool area, people yelling from balcony to balcony.  Clogged sink and bath tub.  The bed is not made for a good night sleep!! I heard the rooms had been renovated and maybe some have, but not the one I got.  In general the place is not good.  The upside was, I checked out at 8pm and was refunded my money with no hassle! But I don't recommend staying there!"
0,"When in search of a gym, do the qualities you look for include insanely crowded, questionably clean spaces with employees who visibly hate their jobs? Great! You're in luck.\n\nTwo stars might even be a little generous for this location. I dislike going here so much that it's affected my motivation to actually work out on a regular basis - which is why I bought a gym membership in the first place. Granted, that was back when the Pure Fitness on Alma School was still open, and I could actually stand that gym. \n\nIt's cheap, if that's all you care about. It's also bright and pretty big - but not big enough to handle how many people are packed in here at ANY given time. Before work? Check. Lunch time? Check. Hour before close? Yep. Easter Sunday? You bet. Good luck coming in at any time that isn't ungodly early in the morning and finding a machine you want without a wait. You're gonna have to do a lot of aimless wandering and less working out.\n\nAlso, whose amazing idea was it to put the group class room in the middle of the gym - which EVERYONE must walk by a million times - with glass walls so that all the creepers and meatheads can stare at you during your yoga session? Extremely uncomfortable, and though they offer a good amount of classes, this feature alone keeps me from attending them.\n\nOnce you find a machine, you'll be lucky if it works. The cardio machines here suck, plain and simple. They're old, inconsistent, frequently broken, and simply terrible at measuring anything. Don't rely on them for that, ever. It's annoying as hell when I can't get an accurate heart rate reading for two seconds. I certainly don't have this problem with the machines at Priest and Elliot.\n\nSo, customer service? Do they actually train their employees to do anything but look miserable and try to sell? I don't remember the last time I was greeted here when I walked in. I don't usually see the same receptionist for very long, and they often don't acknowledge my entrance. In general, it's nice to say hello to the person who is helping pay your check, but whatever. I'd hate working here, too.\n\nAs another reviewer said, people here never wipe down their machines. SO. GROSS. I want to vomit every time I see it. Some huge dude drenched in sweat will drip all over his treadmill and then WALK AWAY. Never will I touch a machine here without wiping it down BEFORE I use it, as well as after. This just goes to show the kind of people that come here, too. No one cares. At all. And no, that girl twirling her hair and texting while she sits on the hip abductor is not going anywhere. Shoot me now.\n\nI could go on about this place for days, but I'll let you read the rest of the reviews for everything else that's wrong here. If you want a cheap gym and are able to get here at 5 AM, you'll be golden. If you're looking for a nice, convenient, friendly place to work out any other time of day, keep searching. This ain't it."
1,"I have practiced yoga for over 20 years, all over the world.  My last 9+ years have been mainly Bikram style (heated room, same 26 asanas and 2 breathing in same order every time, etc).  My review is based on one visit, in which I was fortunate enough to be taught by the creator of Sumits Yoga, Sumit Banerjee.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an 80 minute class in a 104/5 degree heated room.  It is not laying around on pillows.  That being said, there was an old (at least 70!) year old man next to me for most of the class (he did leave early).  Most of the folks were in the 20-50ish range, but I think that anyone could do this class if they are in good health (or at least check with their doc) and take it EASY to get used to the heat.  \n\nYou will sweat.  A lot.  A very very very lot.\n\n+ 1 Star - Cleanliness.  I have a thing about sweaty/hot yoga - I love it, but the smell still, after all this time, makes me queasy.  So how nice it was to be at a studio with little to no stink.  Wood floors in the practice room helped.  Staff seemed very conscious about cleaning up quite often (steamed windows were wiped, drips on floor were mopped etc)\n+ 1 Star - Showers.  It is important to me in practicing hot yoga that there are showers for after.  Granted, there are only two in the ladies (and I would assume 2 in the man's) but that is better than many and, from my experience, The average amount.  You need to BYOT (towel) as they have no towel rental (!!!??!) available.\n+ 1 Star - Big changing room for ladies.  I can't speak for the fellas, but there was plenty room for all us gals to do our thing. I am usually frustrated at whacking elbows with my fellow yoginis both before and after class so this was a nice, welcome change.\n+ 1 Star - Room size.  The asana room was spacious - there were easily 30 people in my class but could have fit 20 more with no problem at all.  Mirrored all but the back (door/wall) sides to help with alignment and focus.\n+ 1 Star - Air.  It is a pet peeve of mine about hot yoga classes that they usually have still, stuffy air.  I start to feel a bit suffocated.  This studio was especially nice in that there were ceiling fans, so though it was hot (104 degrees more or less), I didn't feel suffocated.\n+ 1 Star - The class style.  I wish Mr. Banerjee had studios in LA!!!! I enjoyed this style class immensely.  It was a combination of some flow, some traditional standing postures and some Bikram-styled asanas/combinations.  It was possible to modify and do more or less strenuously depending on your day/energy level.  I cannot rave enough about how wonderful the flow was mingled with the static poses; the transition to the floor postures was even ok and not too abrupt.\n+ 1 Star - Music.  I liked almost all the music that was played (mainly in flow portions of class).  Could have skipped that Bruce Springsteen song, but it was likely in there to appease the more \""rocker\"" types!  other than that, lovely tunes that fit the mood.\n+1 Star - Teacher.  Yes, it was Mr. Banerjee teaching the class, so it was the \""creator\"" himself.  But what better way for my 1st class to go! He is a wonderful teacher, supportive, driving, challenging, engaging, but also nurturing and not a martinet (hear that, Mr. Choudry?).  I genuinely felt pleasure in his tone, word choice and energy.  Obviously a person who believes in what he says/teaches but also is not snooty!\n+ 1 Star - Parking.  Although there is a McDonald's in the front of the lot (temptation! hello!), the rest of the lot is very open with lots of easy parking.  Nice!\n+ 1 Star/ -1 Star - Staff.  The front desk gal, although she was Very Helpful and loaned me a mat and towel for free seemed to be grumpy or sad or just ??  As she was the only other person other than Mr. Banerjee himself with whom I interacted, I was not charmed by her at all.  Lighten up, honey!  Geez!\n+ 1 Star - Retail area.  A few things to buy, including water for class if you forgot yours/want more.  Really liked the yoga clothing collection.  Some good stuff here.\n\nAll in all, I am sad that I don't live near one of the 6 Sumits Yoga in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  I found this class and studio to be perfect for me."
1,"I had one cat, and I liked her a lot. I started to feel a little bad though because she was alone a lot. One day my wife talked me into driving to the humane society \""just to look\"". I now have two cats and I like them a lot. The Arizona Humane Society was professional, courteous, and I had a great experience with them. We were given helpful ideas for every aspect of introducing a second cat to the home and drove away feeling confident, and the fact that Sherlock was covered up to five hundred bucks for an initial checkup was a huge bonus, we actually found a new vet because of it. I will recommend the humane society to anyone I know looking to adopt a friend, it's awesome."
0,Worst customer service ever!!!  Avoid this store if at all possible!
0,"AGREED!!  THEY SUCK!!  DO NOT HIRE THESE FOLKS!  My stove has been out since Jul 14, I am one week shy of a month.  Poor follow-up from reception.  They NEVER call you back.  My Home Warranty refunded my service fee due to poor service.  Awaiting 3rd visit...\""I'm on my way\""....over 45 mins later and I'm still waiting.  I just called and he's still at another location.  Will be another 30 mins; you have got to be kidding me??!!  ZERO!!  A BIG FAT ZERO is what they earned from me."
0,The music was great but the crowd was way too young. And I felt like I was about to fall down the stairs climbing that horrible climb. No. Not again.
1,"After taste-testing many of the restaurants and tea shops for boba tea in Phoenix metropolitan area, I can say that Bomboba serves the best tasting Boba tea.  Their Pad Thai is great too!"
0,Heres my tip...dont order the philly sandwich.  The ratio of chicken filling to the bread was like 10% and the bread 90%  and they should be ashamed to even call it a philly cause they used cheddar sliced cheese.
1,"This place is great! I was visiting from out of town and looking for a place that could airbrush me. They were very flexible with their schedule and fit my friend and I in with no problem. The staff was very friendly, the have great prices, good location, clean place, great hours, & easy to schedule future appointments with this online program. I was very happy with my results! \n I am moving down to Arizona in a couple months and i will go back to their location when im back!"
0,"Lack luster and some things need to change or be upgraded. I can honestly say I was surprised and disappointed and I am sorry to say it because I thought I was going to be blown away by one of the most famous hotels on the strip. Ive stayed in other parts of Vegas and around the United States and I can honestly say Cesars would not be my first choice. The room I felt was super plain and nothing came with the room, most hotels provide something and other amenities.  I just felt are room had none of that off the bat. They didn't seem to share that privy information either, even concierge wasn't helpful for one thing passes into their Pure night club. Pure nightclub was nice I liked the layout but I'm talking of my experience and stay at Cesars. They make it appear as if they don't want you to enjoy the the things they offer snacks and such are obviously hiked. \n\nThe neat things  and stuff on a more positive note, over shower head, the fact its connected to some shops and food places that are really good. Kuerig is in your hotel room to make hot water or coffee (hotel sells 4 kcups for 12.00, grocery stores charge 12.00 for a box of 18!). \n\nWe had to change rooms due to a situation and the room was not cleaned well it was obviously rushed and half done. They need to give the cleaning crew a tad bit more time, this is to be a home away from home, you don't want to have to wonder if something was done correctly.\n\n15.00 usd for wifi per each device and 25.00 per day for multi devices in your room only. Who does that?!  \n1.00 to 2.00 per minute for a LOCAL CALL IN VEGAS 702  NUMBER, really?! I have never in my life been charged for a local call in a city I'm visiting. Ive been to other hotels in Vegas and Ive not seen such a ludicrous thing. I used my cell the entire time unless I called a place in the hotel.\n\nNo free tea or coffee, don't need anything fancy but it just seemed they were out to make you pay.\n\nI feel I wont be back to , any other past and great experiences at other Vegas hotels without feeling like I had to bend over and grab my ankles."
1,"My husband and I came here on his lunch break, and was greeted right away, the Manager walked up and I asked what I was thinking about  getting and I told him that I ALWAYS get the smokehouse sub but wanted to try something different! He suggested a sub and I told him I'll just stick to the same sub so he offered to split his sub w me just so I can try it.... Wow!!! Now that's how u keep a customer coming back!!  Not to mention everyone is super nice always happy and if u enjoy trying different hot sauces they have over 25 different sauces!!!!"
1,"I couldn't agree more, Irish.  Hidden in a tacky strip center, the storefront leaves one a bit apprehensive.  Once inside all trepidation will cease.   From the wine list to the service, and most especially,the food, you can't go wrong.  Some nights you'll even find live music.  Even with reservations, you may have to wait a bit but its worth it.  Just relax at the bar and enjoy a glass of wine.  I suggest making dinner at Nora's the main event as there is no quick in and out at this restaurant.  But then again, I wouldn't want to eat at an Italian restaurant that didn't provide the whole shebang!  Nora's does just that."
0,"Bad selection & owner wouldn't even look at items I brought in to sell because she \""wasn't accepting anymore at  this time.\""  She also ordered lunch on the phone in front of me when I entered the store. Not the way to run a high-end boutique!"
1,"What can I say that hasn't been said yet!?!?!!? Came here around 4 with 5 gfs thinking we were coming at an 'off' time... yeah, we were wrong.  Still waiting an hr and 15 mins to get seated.  \n\nFYI- they don't skip people in line if ONE seat opens up and there's a group of 4 next in line.  So don't get upset if you say random seats empty... they're clearing it out for the next GROUP or PERSON in line.   At first we were like... WHYYYY are there open seats.. but then we realized.  \n\nWe told the person that we would take seats of two or three or five-whichever opened up first!  \n\nThe pan roast is AMAZING.  Level 8... I wish I got level 10 but we were sharing.  Ordered the rice on the side so that way all the sauce wouldn't seep into the rice right away- PLUS you can take leftovers to go!  \n\nThe chef and employees are all amazing and super nice!  Can't wait to come back. This definitely will be a must every time I'm in Vegas from here on out.  \n\nActually, my gfs and I are already planning to do a pan roast party at home, SOON!"
1,We have taken our dogs here since they opened and LOVE this place the STAFF is extremely friendly and My dogs don't home terrified like they do from other places. Prices are very reasonable and if you need just to have your dogs nails trimmed they do it fast and while you hold your pet.. My dogs don't bat a eyelash coming here.
1,"I've been living close to Eastern and Trop for ... like 8 years already but haven't had a chance to check out this place yet. And ... encouraged by great reviews (and :) ... as I find myself following B.K already) I decide to give Las Pupusas a shot. And it definitely lives up to its name ... I was hungry like a wolf so I ended up ordering 4(!) pupusas - 2 with Chicharron (Pork) and 2 with Loroco y Queso (Cheese).\nAnd that was my mistake :) because when girl gave me bag with my food it seemed a little to heavy. They put like a whole pound of spicy cabbage, good 8-9 oz of that liquid stuff you pour on top of it (I just don't know the name of it in Spanish) and 4 good size pupusas.\nI did ask them to cook pupusas crispy because it does taste better.\n\nSo, bottom line:\n+ quality\n+ quantity !\n+ price ... (although it's probably average for this type of places but still) .. my bill was like $7\n- well ... I'm not sure for the rest of the menu ... I will have to try something else but I'll reserve 5 start rating for places that really WOW me. This restaurant is a great value for a casual meal but nothing fancy. So 4 stars - solid GOOD!"
1,My goodness this place is good and bountiful.  It's and abundance of food for a descent prices.  They have very unique flavors of hotcakes and a variety of other dishes.  I ordered the country fried steak and seasoned potatoes which come with a side of buttermilk pancakes.  The potatoes amazing country fried steak was good however I could have had less gravy but no big deal.  Not huge cakes but a great side compliment and it will fill you up.  I will be back to try more of this menu.\nRockford pancakes were pretty good as well with nuts on the side.
1,Review is for the Frozen Daiquiri bar outside Coyote Ugly. I must stop here every time in vegas because they have the best frozen drinks on the strip. I highly recommend. Plus only $2 for an extra shot in your drink! :-)
1,Great anniversary dinner. Justifiably recommended by our friends.  Lovely and decadent. We loved it
0,"So I have been here 3 times and I really wanted it to wow me each and every time but it simply doesn't.  First time I was with a friend and we were drinking more than eating so when my ridiculously expensive bill showed up I almost threw up all the $12.66 martinis I had drank.  Seriously?!?  The only place in town where I wouldn't freak on that price is AZ88 because one martini and you are almost done in.  Our server was friendly but I had to tell her to stop rushing us, she came back every 10 minutes or so wondering if we wanted our check.  I told her I would flag her down when needed but that we planned on being there a while.\nSecond time I went for lunch and everything was ok but not amazing.\nThird time was last night and it will most likely be my last.  Every month 3 of my lady friends and myself try a new place, I actually was the one to suggest here. We started at the bar to have a cocktail while waiting for our whole party to arrive.  When it was time to move to a table our bartender asked us to close out our tab.  Didn't even offer to transfer it which is standard.  We ordered a started of cheese, roasted garlic, prosciutto, cornicons and oysters.  The little nugget of cheese we received was just that, a tiny little nugget.  Now I am a huge cheese snob, I have my very own travel bag from Venissimo Cheese shop in San Diego and every time I visit I come home with roughly $100 worth of cheese.  I know my cheese, I know the cost, I felt cheated that we each only got a nibble.  The oysters were good, not gritty at all, but there were a few staple accouterments that were missing, tabasco and crackers.  I ordered the beet salad which was middle of the road, but I did like that the beets didn't have a loamy taste.  One of my dining companions ordered the steak which was overcooked so she sent it back.  It came back better but with the same sides on the plate, they literally transferred what was on her original plate to the new one.  Terrible!  You don't let a plate sit under the heat lamp while you redo something, you make a whole new plate.  The worst part of the evening was after our appetizer our server informed us that it was almost 9 and the kitchen closes at 9.  WTF!?!  We are already seated, you know we are going to order dinner, there were at least 5 tables full in our section alone and you feel the need to rush our order?!?  Lame is a word that doesn't even do it justice.  To add the cherry on that lame sauce sundae, they kicked us out into the cold to wait for our ride!  It was freezing and all I had was a thin jacket WITHOUT gloves, I was shivering pretty bad by the time my fiance rolled up.  He was pissed that there were 4 women standing outside of the restaurant we just spent a pretty penny at and if there was a place to park he would have gone in himself to complain to the manager. (Thanks for looking out babe!)\nI will finish this off with the positives, they had cocktail onions.  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find cocktail onion served in this town.  Second their system for splitting checks is hands down amazing with us each getting charged 1/4 of the appetizer price.  I haven't seen that before.  Third the decor is nice."
1,"Why is everybody complaining about the size of this restaurant? That's the size, deal with it or take your food to go. And kids? Really, you're on the West side of Madison, buddy...deal with it! But, i do admit it gets busy, but who doesn't like a busy restaurant? That means the food is good, right?\n\nYour bill  can go quite high if you add a protein (chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu, and just recently new meatballs).\n\nOnly complaint, potstickers are terrible, they have no flavor. They look delicious, but do not be fooled. My favorite dish (and of many others) is the penne rosa.  \n\nExcept a crowd around lunchtime, and expect kids...when in doubt!\n\nOh, and great staff here, always friendly and fast!"
1,Very good service but the food is better!  All made from scratch.  Will be back very soon.  Portions are large.
1,"Abby and I were cruising around Old Town on bikes when we passed a sign, \""$2 tapas\"" 3pm - 6pm Monday-Friday. Even if the food is mediocre, that is worth a shot, especially to sit on the patio overlooking the \""waterfront\"" and Camelback mountain.\n\nWe sat down and as bikers weren't alone. There were several bikes locked up next to the patio, so I felt better about how we were dressed. Actually I normally wouldn't care about how I was dressed but the place looked so nice. One of the things I remember the most is the guy working the front door. He had this Godfather \""let me take care of you guys\"" vibe and made me feel really comfortable about trying out this new place. \n\nOkay enough about the place, the food is what makes this place amazing. We ordered just about everything on the menu and had about 2 drinks each and walked out full and spent less than $20 w/ tip! The food had soooo much amazing flavors and the presentation was very visually pleasing. \n\nIt sounds like they have a lot of interesting things going on at night but I can't wait to get back here for another happy hour."
1,"Yay for good Blockbusters.  There is one way closer to the house, but their selection sucks, the people are rude, and it's just plain ghetto.  This location is very large and has a great selection.  I think their selection is better than most.  The employees we have interacted with have always been very friendly and have a good sense of humor.  We actually have the Blockbuster online thing (think Netflix) and it works fantastically.  Whenever we come here to use one of our in-store exchanges, we are always in and out of there very quickly.  The other location seemed to have difficulties with that.  Anyway, this is my favorite Blockbuster in the valley.  The two reasons I subtracted one star is the awful parking lot, and I wish it were a bit closer to my house."
0,I really don't think I'm the target audience for a place like this.  I understand what they're going for with these artisan pizzas but I really would just like a little sauce on my pizza.  Just a little...\n\nThe flavors are usually good but the lack of any sauce and more often than not over cooked dough make it hard for me to want to keep coming back to places like this.
1,"I visited this place for an event showcasing other local South Madison eatery's and I am definitely a fan.  I actually cannot believe that I have not been here before.  The food is fantastic!  I ordered the tacos with rice and beans, so simple but so good.  The meat was really tender and well seasoned.  I should also mention that the chips and salsa pre-taco were also really good; you are given two options, one with kick and one without.  Both options were really good.  \n\nI look forward to coming back to this place and trying many things on the well sized and well priced menu."

0,"I sadly give North Mountain a less than enthusiastic review because I had such high expectations.  Unfortunately, while the beer was fairly good, the service needed some serious attention.  \n\nWe went the day after the grand opening and waited ten minutes for them to figure out where they were going to seat us when they had more than half of their tables available.  Then, it took another fifteen minutes for us to get a server who would take our drink and appetizer order.  By the time we finally got our beers and pretzels, we were so discouraged that we opted to go have dinner elsewhere.  \n\nAlso, this place isn't nearly as kid friendly as most of the other breweries in town--it's mostly an eclectic adult menu--or if they have a kids menu, nobody told us about it.\nI would definitely give them another shot, but they need to figure out how to serve their patrons in a more organized fashion."
0,"I appreciate the third wave coffee shops that have popped up in the valley over the last couple of years. I love what Cartel, Press, Echo, et. al are doing for the coffee culture. Cartel has the best Iced Toddy I've tasted, Echo the best pour over and most consistently bright latte art, and Press wins the \""most knowledgeable barista\"" award. \n\nBut I take issue with the way in which Giant is attempting to do this. \n\nI have worked in three coffee shops with varying degrees of coffee cred, and I appreciate the spectrum of a coffeebar menu--from drip, pour over, french press, espresso. I don't drink Starbucks, but appreciate their role in the second wave introduction of coffee to Americans--especially in the 90's.\n\nTwice I have gone to Giant in an attempt to get my favorite summertime coffee beverage. Two shots of espresso with a little chocolate and half and half shaken over ice. The result is a wonderfully frothy, refreshingly sweet cup of love. \n\nThe first time I went in I was frankly told that \""No, I can't do that for you.\""  No further explanation. No lengthy lecture about how the ice \""shocks\"" the espresso. No discussion of the integrity of the espresso. After this, I shrugged my shoulders, ordered a double espresso. Sure, I was impressed with the sparkling water (as I would receive in Europe)  I was given as a refreshing cap-off to my beverage, but it wasn't what I originally ordered. So, then, unsatisfied, I attempted to order my other summertime staple: an iced toddy. It was different, sweeter, nuttier than I'd had in awhile and I appreciated its character.  Luckily for me, the cranky barista who refused my order had left, so I went back up to ask about their toddy; what kind of beans they used, how long they let it cold brew, etc. It is a mix of all their beans, the girl said. \""Do you like it?\"" she asked. \""Yes!\"" I said. \""Oh,\"" she said, \""I forgot, we also pre-sweeten it.\"" No wonder. It's interesting that they sweeten their toddy, but won't serve me my drink. \n\nThe second time the gentleman listened to what I wanted and, again, I was told that they can't do it. I was told that they \""respect the fragility of the espresso\"" and \""we serve our espresso in a more traditional manner.\""  At least I was given a reason, and I respect that. \n\n But let me contrast this with my experience at Press Coffee. \n\nAt the bottom of Press' menu they have a little sign that reads \""if you don't see your drink, ask us.\""\n\nSo, one day, I did. And the barista listened to my request and giddily told me that he'd gladly make my drink, and beyond that, it would probably be the best one I've ever had. \""Why do you think it will be the best one I've ever had?\"" I asked.  He told me that Press believes that all of their ingredients are the best of the best and that any combination of them will produce a superior tasting drink. When I told him what Giant did (without naming names), he went above his call of duty in order to try and educate me (a critical phase of the the third wave). He defended Giant--he felt that protecting a beans integrity is important, while using this as an opportunity to talk about how third wave shops need to do a better job not alienating customers who have unique tastes. \n\nI understand that Giant is not alone in refusing drink orders:\n\nhttp://andiamnotlying.com/2008/murky-coffee-arlington-hold-that-espresso-between-your-knees/\n\nBut I am not that obnoxious customer who doesn't understand espresso. I'm an ally, someone looking to refine my tastes, expand my understanding of coffee and the third wave. I can't tell you how much I appreciate baristi like those at Press. They're the ones who are going to \""convert\"" the Starbucks drinkers, and, ultimately, conquer the world's coffee tastes. If Giant doesn't change their attitude I'm afraid their going to alienate a growing base of customers looking for top-quality coffee."
1,"I am from Santa Barbara and had eaten several times at the original one.  Having been disappointed by some of the other hamburger chains that have come in here in the last few years with much fanfare from people that came from the same towns I was worried that a hamburger from my own home town might be a let down from either a taste or value stand point.  I need not have worried.  I took a friend with me and we each had a mushroom swiss  burger and I had onion rings and she had sweet potato fries.  We both liked the food.  2 burgers, 2 drinks, fries and onion rings were under $19 incl tax.  And being a lovely day we found a spot on the patio and camped out for over an hour.  The staff was friendly and close to being too attentive.  Parking sucks.  Even after the original opening hype they are still packed for a Sunday lunch so they must be doing something right.  I know I will return."
1,"I had the Sizzling ninja bowl, which was awesomely hot and mighty good.  It had jalapeno and siracha sauce, which goes perfectly together with the ninja teriyaki sauce.  Oh, their donuts is the best in town too.  Hot girls serving you is a plus also."
0,Had a layover here....3 hours!!!! Did not enjoy it. Bathroom floors are sooo sticky and dirty. There are no really good places to eat. When you book a flight advice is to avoid this airport!!
0,"This review is for the two employees who happen to be working at the time, not about Geico as a whole. I have never felt so unwelcome in a business as these two associates made me feel. They were so blatantly rude and acted like we were wasting their time. I went in with a couple questions and they acted like we didn't even deserve the time of day. I have never been in a geico office thanks for the WORST FIRST IMPRESSION ever. Doesn't even deserve one star but I had to pick one"

1,"This is my hotel of choice on the strip.  I really like the layout.  There are enough restaurants to have enough variety in dining during my traditional 2-3 night stays.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  My only gripe has to do with self-parking.  If you are a guest to the hotel and want to self park, the check-in area is not very convenient as you have to walk through the casino to check-in, then walk back through the casino to get to the elevators for the rooms.  If you valet park, then you won't run into this issue, but I like to save a few bucks and park myself.  However, the Palazzo doesn't have this problem at all.  The parking garage elevator brings you right into the check-in area.  You can also access the Palazzo parking garage from Spring Mtn Rd (exit off the 15 frwy) and avoid driving on the strip.  Palazzo and Venetian are connected and accomodations are very similar.  As I like to self-park and avoid driving on the strip, I'll probably be staying at the Palazzo."
0,"Quite possibly the worst hotel we have ever stayed in!! Absolutely filthy! The hallways smelled, half the elevators didn't work and it took us half an hour in line just to pick up our key AFTER we registered! Never again!!!"
0,"First time coming to tropical smoothie - ordered a island green and added 2 additional fruits. I asked the young lady who made my drink if it was good this way she said \""no one had retuned it before.\""  My drink turned out horrible - I asked if I could get it remade the manager was fairly rude and told me they do not remake drinks. However, I could purchase another one for another $7. Had I known I was unable to return the drink I wouldn't have ordered it. Needless to say I am very disappointed in the lack of customer service and won't be returning to this store or referring anyone."
1,"UPDATE:\n\nMan, I love the food at KoMex. Their bulgogi tacos are some of the best tacos I've ever had, their teriyaki chicken is awesome, and I still like the cute girl who works here .\n\nMy problem now is that the wait is really long. I recently walked in to order a few tacos and stuff, and I waited almost 40 minutes. That's not cool. \n\nStill, I like it here. I'll just have to order my food ahead of time for my next trip."
1,"District American Kitchen and Wine Bar, I had great time this pass Sat., nice new venue with every thing you could ask for ,the food was off the hook , and it was happy hour, that started  at 10pm, the staff was friendly, great service , and you got the best of both worlds, they had Live Entertainment , and this band was hott!! had people dancing down the street , this venue is a diamond in the ruff.... Bluesman Mike"
0,"Mediocre, corporately-bland Mexican food (as one would expect from a chain restaurant, even though Los Gringos apparently isn't). The perky waitress either didn't deliver my simple request to the kitchen or they ignored it: I asked for my Chimichanga extra crispy, it arrived soft and doughty. Good chips & salsa, but that should be a given. Wouldn't go back and can only assume the diners giving four or five stars to Los Gringos have never had top flight Mexican. It you think the Olive Garden is good Italian food, this might be the place you; otherwise steer clear."
1,"I decided to try this place after reading the reviews about the awesome Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm a huge fat kid at heart so anything RV is right up my alley.\n\nThere was about a 15 minute wait when we got there (noon on a Monday). The place is pretty small so the wait times are to be expected. The menu is pretty big. They have about 12 different kinds of specialty pancakes, omelettes, crepes, breakfast items and a few lunch selections.\n\nI ordered the omelette which came with 2 pancakes that I of course upgraded to Red Velvet for an additional charge. The omelette was delicious and the breakfast potatoes were pretty good as well. I saved the best for last: The Pancakes. It was like dessert and breakfast all in one. The cream cheese \""syrup\"" is more like icing but it gives the pancakes the real RV feel. The pancakes themselves aren't too sweet so it is a perfect balance.\n\nNext time I want to try the S'mores pancakes but that's a whole different review. :)"
0,"after reading review had high expectations, unfortunately not me not my wife was able even finish our crapes, nothing else I can add to that"
0,This place was the worst restaurant ever.The lasagna tasted like crappy Stouffer's makes better frozen lasagna please do not ever waste your money go to McDonald's and get a  Big Mac instead.Way over priced .
1,"At first glance this place looks like any other privately owned coffee shop. When you walk in the mood is calm and relaxing. You're greeted with a smile and upon looking at the menu excitement builds as you can tell that this is no ordinary coffee shop. It becomes obvious that the proprietors Tiffany and Mae put a lot of effort into creating menu choices that are not only healthy, but delectable and unique. The coffee is wonderful and flavorful especially if one's tired of the over roasted bitterness of Starbucks and many others coffee. As far as the food goes I have trouble ordering anything other than either the hashtag breakfast sandwich or the mixed berry salad. My favorite smoothie would definitely have to be the kale champ as it is not too sweet and tastes incredible.  frequent this establishment as I feel others should as well. Oh yeah and if you're having a bad day you should pop in for an ice cream waffle. It makes everything better."
1,"Nice little restaurant with friendly owners.  We got lunch combos that come with soup of the day, fried rice, a crab puff, and a spring roll.  The lemon chicken and J&M house chicken were both yummy.  Fresh tasting food with good flavor.  Nothing was greasy so I didn't get that gross full feeling like I have at other places. I like supporting non chain places like this and would definitely eat here again."
0,"This was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. The 45 minute wait to be seated to eat didnt bother me until I understood why. We (a group or five people-average) saw our waiter maybe two times while we were seated. The waiter was so unorganized he skipped taking my wife's order and she had to wait until the food that was previously ordered was all gone to place her order (with the missing waiter). After my wife received her order and she finished eating, we then had to wait well over 20 minutes for the check. We all walked out assuming the check was paid, but to my surprise it wasn't, they chased me down in the parking lot and the first thing that was said out of the servers mouth was, \""I'm going to call the police if you dont give me your ID\"", what happened to \""Sir, I'm sorry but the check was not paid\"". I spoke to the manager about the lack there of attention of his server, and his response was, \""oh\"".\nFor a restaurant with so many positive reviews, I find it hard to believe that we were the lucky or unlucky people to enjoy the wonderful food and experience (based on other reviews on yelp) the Las Vegas Firefly.\n\nAs far as the food, I was sick shortly after leaving this location; but next time if I want to wait in line and be sick after eating I'll venture to the the Mc Donald's at the local Walmart for fried food."
0,This place is so hit and miss. Sometimes the food is excellent. Other times it's pretty bad and then you sit there wondering why you paid as much as you did for food you got. The good news is I think I figured it out!!!! There is one guy who is there a lot of times he is a stereotypical looking Hispanic that is fairly short and probably in his late 40s early 50s... He is no good! Everyone else that works there is great! But that guy seriously charges you more by a couple bucks for burritos. (My go to is the bean cheese and rice) because that's not on the menu it some how rings up at $5.50... If anybody else is working it rings up as three $3.80. And for some reason if you ever seen him in the kitchen the food just taste bad...  I have been here probably 15 to 20 times... However I think I am just going to give them 2 stars and move on... Avoiding certain people at restaurants is just too much work
1,"Very nice people who did an amazing job on two of our computers.  One was the transfer of files from an old computer to a newly purchased one.  The other computer was a laptop that was running very slow.  The laptop is now running great, it's like it is a new computer.  I am already recommending these guys to friends.  They do an amazing job!"
0,"My party ordered poutine and smoked meat, and it was very tasty. It's not as amazing as I was expecting genuine Montreal poutine to be, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. One minor complaint is that my entree didn't come with the advertised pickle, but I managed to survive.\n\nThe much larger problem I had with this restaurant is that the waiter gave a guilt-trip sob story about tips at the end of the meal. My bill was for $37, and I gave the waiter $40, expecting change. He started to tell me about how if they don't receive a large enough tip, they get taxed on it or some silly bullshit. I proceeded to tell him that I had intended to leave the actual tip on the table, which is what I always do, and I think that's fairly standard. He then said the exact same thing to our table mates.\n\nBegging for tips, regardless of how much customers decide to tip, is NEVER okay. This needs to stop. It made my party and I extremely uncomfortable. It appears that I'm not the only reviewer who had an experience like this.\n\nOn a final note, service was a little slow. We witnessed one table leave before being served after they'd waited long enough.\n\nUpdate: I complained about our waiter after our trip, but never received a response. That sort of behaviour cannot be excused. Don't eat here."
0,"Food was comparable the camelback location. Ping pong tables and patio was great. However,  the camelback crew needs to come down and train the waiters on providing service."
1,"I'm dinging it one star because it IS the home of the Dodgers and that in itself makes it not perfect. \n\nI visited this park yesterday, Sunday, March 29th. A Dodgers vs. Padres game. BEAUTIFUL stadium. I did think it was odd that the main entrance was in center field and not home plate, where I entered. Love the natural, rusted look of everything. Seems very large for a spring stadium. \n\nExcited out the center field entrance before game time and explored the practice fields and water features. Awesome area. I think I need a whole day just to see everything out there. \n\nWe sat on the grass, in left field on the foul side of the foul pole. Great area, beautiful view. Unlike a lot of the other grass area seating at other parks, we could actually see the scoreboard and all the fielders. A thumbs up in my book! \n\nAll the workers were really nice. I got a hi from most of them just walking by! \n\nCan't comment on any of the food/drinks as I didn't spend any money there. I brought in all my own stuff. \n\nI was disappointed in the team store. I was looking for something commemorating the first year of the park, like I was able to pick up in Goodyear. Nothing. Would have been nice to have. Really, that's the main reason I wanted to get out there this year, to get an inaugural year souvenir. \n\nGreat place. If it weren't so far away, I'm sure I'd go more often."
0,"I wore a pair of their shoes for about 15 minutes this morning. After about 15 minutes, I decided to look at my foot to see why it hurt so badly. To my surprise, I saw that a piece of sharp plastic on the inside of the shoe had cut my foot open, and my foot and the shoe were bloody. When I took them back to the store, they refused to exchange them because I didn't have a receipt, even though they had the H&M label on the inside, and they were very lightly worn. So I won't be buying shoes there anymore, I guess... So now, an hour later, after I called their corporate office, they have decided to give me store credit..."
0,"Sadly this is a shadow of its former self. So much has gone downhill -- except the prices -- that this once outstanding spot is now a to-be-avoided tourist trap.\n\nA simple meal for two will cost about \u00a3200 with wine but the service will be about what you'd expect of a nando's. Different servers and indifferent other types pop by the table about once every thirty minutes whether you need something or not. \n\nThe Sommelier poured about 200ml in my glass, which I had to send back. The starters were still a good 20 minutes away. \n\nIn short: food tasty but overpriced. Service worst I've ever seen at this price range."
1,"We were hungry, and we had just spent a ton of money shopping at the Miracle Mile mall.  So we wanted something cheap.\n\niPhone + Yelp + one $ sign + Planet Hollywood = Earl of Sandwich\n\nIt was the highest rated one dollar sign restaurant in the area, and it definitely deserves it.  I had \""the Original,\"" which is simply a roast beef sandwich.  However, their execution is perfect.  The fresh baked bread is soft and delicious.  The cheese and horseradish sauce perfectly accompany the juicy roast beef.  Dip a little mustard or steak sauce if you like, and BAM... perfection.  DAMN, I could eat another one of those right now!"
1,"Great Place Love there drinks the only mistake was walking over and sitting in 110 degree weather we should have driven over. The services is good I got a chocolate soda and my wife a slushie. The burgers are great, but like I said try eating in front of all theses cars with the engines going and the heat not good"
1,"They seem to have everything. Obscure films, B films, foreign films, nearly every weird movie I've found out on the internet, they have it. (One time there was some anime I wanted to see but they didn't have, but they explained that all the copies out there were pirated, and they'd be happy to add it to their collection if I could find a legitimate source for them.)\n\nSecondly... its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block.\n\nI kind of wish there was a way to return videos without wading into campus, though."
1,"This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week, which while I would prefer 11, works for me. Also, going at non-peak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face- ain't no crowds at 9:30 pm! I generally stay in the Women's Fitness Center, which is a gym inside itself, but every now and then I'll make it upstairs. The desk staff is always friendly, and there are plenty of amenities to utilize. The one area I haven't ventured into yet are the group exercise, mainly for scheduling reasons, but I am eager to sneak into one one day."
0,"When I was first introduced to the place a couple years ago, I thought this place was fantastic.  The slices were huge, there was always a huge selection of pizzas on display, and the wings were great.  But after about a year of going there, I kid you not, weekly, I started to see a drop in standard.  The pizzas weren't always warm, if you asked for say a mushroom slice, be prepared to get canned mushroom thrown on a reheated cheese slice.  The wings weren't always warm either, and sometimes lacked the sauce that once made these wings great.  Recently, I've noticed that they've gotten rid of the punch cards (I guess not many people were using them anyway), and my favorite honey-hot wings.  Instead, I was told that I could get honey-mild wings, or get hot wings and pay for a side of honey.  I'm going to stop myself here before I go on a rant, but that drove me over the edge and well, the only reason I'll be stopping by in the future, is out of nostalgia of the place this used to be."
1,"Earls Sandwich... it's simply THE BEST!!!!!!  Awhile I was in Las Vegas, friends and I stopped by here to grab a bite.  Everything was incredibly delicious!  After painting the town with fond memories, we made a trip back the same night to have some more!  And also stopped by the next morning to grab some for the road home!  Since I'm from Orange County, we found out a new location was opening in Downtown Disney and couldn't wait for it to open!"
1,"Family owned and run...  The barber staff does a great job listening to what you want, so the welcome your specific haircut details.  Boris is the owner, who can cut with the best of them, but the entire staff is very detail oriented and gives great haircuts.  Highly recommended for anyone getting a haircut in North Phoenix or Scottsdale."
0,"I have never had Adele do my hair, but based on reviews, I'm sure she is absolutely wonderful. I'd be very cautious of Marie; she burnt the crown of my hair off back in October and then attempted to fix it, only to burn off a side area while dying it a \""dark blonde\"" which was actually a dark brown. To have to live under a wig and tri-colored hair as it grows out for the next couple years without the option to dye it due to the burning is very emotionally painful every day. This is an extreme case and obviously does not happen to all of her clients, but just be aware of the absent mindedness, and choose your stylist  based on your research."
1,"Boooooomb! Great place to eat. Great experience and food is the whole shabang! Love the raw oysters, Cajun fries, fried oysters, Calamari, corn, potatoes, clams, crabs, shrimp, everything! I've never ordered anything that I haven't liked. I especially love that the raw oysters are fresh and compliment well with their special sauce. I most def go here at least 2-3 a month."
0,"The service here was terrible, the girl at the register was obviously not happy to be working today! We ordered half a dozen and I started to select which ones I wanted and she rudely said \""hold on!\"" And finished up the order. After we paid and I started selecting my donuts, one that I picked wasn't included in the half dozen price (which is why I would have liked to pick first)! So we had to pay again for the other donut and she acted extremely inconvenienced, are you serious?!"

0,"I hardly ever complain about a business on Facebook but I feel compelled. Many of my friends are Realtors and get their cars washed frequently. I will never go back to Danny's Family Car Wash. My car was still dirty after it was washed and I feel they did a poor job handling the customer service issues I shared with them. My shop cloths I used re-washing the dirt from my car, rims and paint when I returned home, were filthy. $30 I will never get back and precious moments of my life wasted in a futile attempt to gain customer satisfaction. Refunding my $30 would have been far less expensive than having poor reviews all over the social media channels.  Not happy!"
1,"I tried Cozymel's on a recommendation from my parents.  Living in San Diego, I never go to chain Mexican places - there are just too many other places to try.  I was expecting Cozymel's to be okay, nothing great.\n\nWe went for lunch, and I was happy to see a whole page of lunch specials for about $8.  Usually, an enchilada combo plate could set you back close to $15 at a Mexican chain.  Not here (during lunch at least).  \n\nI ordered the taco salad with black beans instead of meat.  It came in an enormous flour tortilla shell - tostada style.  It was excellent.  The ingredients were very fresh, and it had just the right amount of everything. The chips and salsa were also fresh and delicious - no gigantic pieces of cilantro in the salsa, yay!  \n\nOthers ordered a seared chicken burrito, tortilla soup, and an enchilada plate.  Everyone thought everything was surprisingly good.  The service was fine.\n\nSign up for their email list and get $10 off.  Cozymel's is great if you're looking for something reasonably priced and healthy-ish (depending on what you order) instead of stuffing yourself at a Vegas buffet!  I'd return."
1,"I  can be a bit critical of bbq, and I love this place.  The meat is good enough without sauce, and that's all I need.\n\nI recommend the smoked catfish.  I haven't had any smoked fish like this; it's amazing. \n\nThe service is nice, kind waitress.  I guess they can run out of food.  That's kind of like the good bbq joints you would run across in the South.  Go early."
1,"this place is AWESOME if you like crepes! they have so much variety for amazing prices. great customer service and beautifully decorated. oh! also a wide variety of drinks. during summertime, they usually give\nyou a side of fruit and during winter right now, they are serving soup (fideo soup which is super yummy). plus many different menu items, sweet crepes, crepes that would usually be in a sandwich, and breakfast crepes. my favs are the rosarito and the grand turk. no matter what you order, you can never go wrong! no other crepe place can beat this one!!! enjoy!"
0,"As per usual with gyms like Gold's, beware of the hidden fees. Gym is okay....equipment and surroundings are dated and past their prime. Make sure you read the fine print. I just went to quit my contract and found out I had been charged a fee of $39 for annual renewal, whatever that entails. You need to give 31 days notice of quitting so they can gouge another months fee out of you. The lady Amanda told me that I was unlikely to get a refund on the annual fee I saw and that I was to be charged another month also. They don't really care if you are unhappy at Gold's. They just want to get as much cash out of you as possible. I will continue to work out at my apartment complex at Camden. Much nicer and free bottled water."
0,Adam W\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't too impressed about the restaurant and the food.. Nevertheless I will start with what I enjoyed.. German cuisine is not Always the most popular but to prepare the many exotic dishes... It's going to be tough to compete.  The service and atmosphere was nice.  But when it comes to the food. You better win the customer over on the first visit if you want repeat customers. The presentation is and must be atr\nAttractive to the eye and and the taste must be able to stop the talking at the table but afterwards not stop by getting the word out.  I had the pretzel dumplings with gravey and mushrooms. . Sounds good and tastes good... But I just wished they had put real pretzel Instead of rye bread. Will I go back... Probably not... There are just too many other eateries that will give you a better experience.

1,"This is going to sound funny from a non coffee drinker but I go here for something else: the What's a burrito- breakfast burrito. Seems random that a coffee shop should make such obscenely yummy burritos but Cartel downtown does. I will get veggie or with sausage or bacon. I think the difference is the ingredients are really fresh and they put spinach, potatoes, cheese and pico in it. Yum! Most joints don't put spinach in their burritos. I also like the GBY I think it's called granola, berries yogurt. Really good. The vibe is also cool though the seats are uncomfortable so don't go their to work for long periods of time. Also no bike racks boo.\n\nBut get the burrito!"
0,"I was at the Venetian yesterday for the Consumer Electronic Show.  I decided to try B&B Burger and Beer instead of driving somewhere to eat.  \n\nI was surprised that the place was not busy at 12:45 PM.  I sat at the bar and ordered their Bar Burger (build your own), an order of fries and ice tea.  I mentioned my server that I don't want salt on the burger and fries.\n\nIt took 17 minutes before my lunch was served.  The burger was average.  I ordered it on a sesame seed bun with lettuce, tomato and added Provolone cheese.  The bun was not soft and chewy.  The lettuce was iceberg lettuce - no nutritional value to it.  A single slice of tomato - could not taste the tomato.  The burger was cooked medium instead of medium-well as I requested.\n\nThe fries had six to eight full length fries.  The rest were broken pieces of fries.  The fries were good and fresh.\n\nThe cost:\n\nBar Burger (burger, lettuce and tomato)  $10.00\nProvolone Cheese (all cheeses on the menu) $2.00\nFries $2.00\nIce Tea approximately $3.00 \n\nMy total bill with tax was close to $23.00 Wow!\n\nI would have been better off with convention food. \n\nA much better place to go is Bachi Burger in Las Vegas."
0,"I really wanted to like this place. The reviews here are mostly good. I had the Tangerine Chicken. I realize that this probably isn't a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I've been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn't have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]\n\nSome of the issues I found:\n1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. \n2. Price, it wasn't that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.\n3. Service: I have no complaints. I'm not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.\n4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn't say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.\n5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in \""brown sauce.\"" The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. \n\nHow could the food have been better. INAPC [I'm not a professional chief], but:\n1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. \n2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. \n3. Don't reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy."
0,"Horrible Experience! Stay away! You have been Warned!!\nOh My God, is this place terrible. Did they lose there chef? If not, they need too. Well, we arrived, a pre-set event with 12 couples for dinner. We arrived, and they were not ready for us. We actually arrived about 10 minutes after our confirmed time. It was a Chinese fire drill to get us seated 20 minutes later, 30 minutes after our confirmed reserved time. \n\""Strike One\"": Our salads arrived at the table and the kitchen failed to dress them! \n\""Strike Two\"": Then our Hanger Steak entr\u00e9es arrived Cold and Overcooked on the meat and the sides were raw and under-cooked. We should have known it was a goner when we asked for medium-rare and the server said the kitchen only does medium? If, we were there ourselves, we would have got up and left.\n \""Strike Three\"": The Dessert arrives. They called it: Blood Orange Cr\u00e8me Brule??  It was un-edible. Who ever made this and then let it be served should be fired on the spot. There is not a Culinary School in America that would call this Cr\u00e8me Brule. Ugh!!  Take this as a warning and head over the \""Eleven\"" where we dined last night, which was spot on for 3 magnificent courses. If this place is in business 12 months from now, I will be surprised.  Take my advice and head somewhere else."
1,"THANK YOU cool yelp eliters for guiding me to yet another wonderful spot. I've passed this on Atwood but it never stood out enough to convince me to take a night off of my usual Thai places.\n\nThe reviews all are correct - the food here is fantastic. It's super casual so it's somewhere I would go if you're really just looking to treat your taste buds for a low key dinner. I want to try ordering delivery, but the fees are such that I would probably only do it with a large group. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nTom Kha soup: this coconut broth soup is a favorite of mine and something I use to compare Thai restaurants because it usually doesn't vary so much. Monsoon Siam probably served the most unique version I've ever tasted; it was tangy and I want to say citrusy! I also liked that you could order mushrooms with this instead of the usual tofu or chicken. \n\nSun dried beef: ordered this because of a yelp review that claimed people \""sing praises\"" to this dish. After one bite, we were singing praises. It's sooo flavorful and not overly dry! A lot of food for $7, easy to share with at least 3 people.\n\nRed curry: spicy (be warned if you can't take the heat) without losing the inherent flavor of the dish. Very brothy, which I personally prefer. I got the tofu because of a yelper who said they don't typically love tofu but this tofu is an exception. I totally agree; the texture is sophisticated and it really takes the flavor of the dish.\n\nPad see ew: fluffy noodles! Great with tofu. My friend who ordered this was so happy!\n\nMy friend is a huuuuge Ha Long Bay guy, and admitted that Monsoon Siam's food is better! Can't wait to come back and try more!"
1,"My annual trip to spoil my taste buds at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon . . . can it get any better? Can this really be better than last year?\n\nOur last night in Vegas, and after dinners at Lotus of Siam, Valentino's, and Nob Hill, we were both looking forward to our dinner here, and getting slightly concerned about potential heart attacks -- which didn't stop us from ordering the foie gras, it just stopped us from ordering their tasting menu . . . \n\nThe amuse bouche was a foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and a Parmigiano-Reggiano foam . . . OMG!\n\nAnd it only got better for there!!!\n\nAgain, with careful scrutiny, bargains CAN be found on the wine list, which is generally stocked with some great wines and your typical \""Vegas Casino markup.\""\n\nBut -- again this year -- L'Atelier was far and away our best meal in Las Vegas . . . stunning."
1,"El Rico's Dos is a perfect example of what traditional Mexican cuisine should be. They offer all of the everyday Mexican dishes like enchiladas, tacos, chimichangas and anything else you can think of. I haven't found one item on the menu I don't like.\nTheir chips and salsa are delicious and bottomless. One can get carried away if not careful :] If you like salsa with a kick ask for a side of their hotter salsa. It packs a real punch. \nThey offer an array of bottles beers along with a selection of fine tequilas for margaritas or on the rocks if thats what you like.\nAlso if you decide to stop by on a Tuesday they have a special including $2 tacos and/or Tecates. You can't go wrong with this incredible deal. Their shredded beef and chicken tacos are excellent. \nThis establishment is very family oriented and the owners care deeply about customer experience and satisfaction. So don't be surprised if Rich the founder of El Rico's Dos stops by your table to ask how everything is. \nIn conclusion this restaurant is by far one of the best Mexican joints I have visited. I have never had a bad experience here and I most likely never will. \n\nP.S. Their Queen Creek location has recently closed down but this location serves everything the other one did if not more."
1,"Ok, so Pinkberry infiltrating the Charlotte FroYo scene wasn't my greatest hope and dream, but the Arboretum location has turned me into a believer. Walk into the IKEA-laden shop and feast your eyes upon some of the most audacious flavors known to the Yogurt. The staff always assists newbies and hands out samples like its a festival. My adivce: If you've never been to Pinkberry or you are trying froyo for the first time, sample all of them. There is always a good range of regular flavors and a few adventurous choices. \n\nThe staff always remembers us and knows that we get two minis. Thanks for the recognition! We may as well start a Pinkberry clubhouse nearby. \n\nToppings: The fruit is cut a little too large for my liking, but suffice is to say that it is fresh and not out of a gross can or frozen. All together now: \""Dark Chocolate Crisps are the best thing since sliced bread.\"" Aaaand there was much rejoicing throughout the land. These are the best topping for....any of the yogurts. I don't even care if it's mango, these little guys are your best friend. Perfect amount of crunch and chocolate flavor. Like a miniature chocolate symphony of crunchy greatness packed in each spoonful. \n\nThanks, Pinkberry for entering the Charlotte scene so tastefully. You've won over this FroYo aficionado. Cheers!"
0,"Crapsteak was a fine dining flop.\n\nI was really excited to eat at Craftsteak.  After watching many episodes of Top Chef and hearing Chef Tom C. chastise contestants regarding quality, execution and 'if it's not right, don't serve it', I was anxiously anticipating a truly fine dining experience of extraordinary quality.  Well Tommy, you failed.  Epic fail.  It was one of the worst meals I've had in an upscale fine dining establishment.  The meat was a poor cut, the service slower than snot, the meal cold and the sides greasy.  Presentation was thoroughly poor.  The wait staff bumbled over each other trying to figure out who got what.  I now refer to CraftSteak as 'CrapSteak'. When I now see Tom shooting his mouth off on TC, I laugh my ass off over the hypocracy. Tom, please pack your knives and go home."
1,"Amazing customer service!  Everyone was so friendly and hilarious!  The food was incredible, probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. All of of really enjoyed the food and the music too. Great place to eat on the strip!"
1,"Spring Roll Factory offers freshly rolled to order spring rolls, which seems like a rarity these days.  We went with the Factory Roll (pork and shrimp).  Very tasty and very fresh.  We also tried the Pho Tai and the Bun (noodle plate with chicken), which were both excellent.  The menu is small and they don't offer many options (such as egg noodles).  Our son is picky and he got an order of steamed rice for $1.  \n\nThe dining area is small but seemed clean and the owner was very friendly and helpful. \n\nWe'll definitely be back when we're in the area."
0,"Still using the soft opening excuse. No one greeted us today. Server on the roof recommend a beer they were out of. Went to sit downstairs and found it difficult to be served. We had a table just no server. With the exception of Andrew, I found the entire staff to be rude and lacking knowledge of their own menu. Our server never introduced himself and seemed to lack server experience. My wife was greeted at the table to a totally offensive \""joke\"" tied to the mason candle. I think it may have fallen off before we left.  We actually had a female server stop at our table to ask US about what we eating.     I went with excitement but left very disappointed. I will give them another try in a few weeks when the soft opening is over."
0,"I do not normally write reviews.  However, I would not be doing the restaurant justice without letting them and you know the service was horrible.  Our waiter was on drugs or something similar.  He left us unattended on numerous occasions.  After several hours we complained to the hostess.  A security officer came to check on us and apologized.  He explained that there was a private party and they were understaffed.  He returned about 30 minutes later and offered to take our order.  Soon our tweaked out waiter asked if we need anything and we replied our food would be nice!  This was the longest 4 hour dining experience of my life not to mention of my clients."
0,"Bought tickets at the fashion show mall store. First of all, what's wrong with having the line INSIDE the mostly empty mall hallway (with no adjacent store) in the AIR CONDITIONING as opposed to  the over 100 degree heat holding tix4tonight umbrellas if only to create the buzz of people crazy for cheap tickets?\nThey sold me VIP tickets to a show with either general admission or VIP.  When we got there we were seated well back in the theater and not in the VIP section. When I inquired as to the misunderstanding, the seating person said this WAS the VIP section if you got your cheaper ticket somewhere else. So beware! - you may not always get what you think you are. \n\nAnother point, was that the LCD screen outside changes continuously so I took a pic with my iphone only to have the guy there fuss about it saying I can't do that.  First of all, its a public display.  Secondly, I asked why they didn't put a sign up  - he said  \""because I'm telling you right now\"".  Problem: right now was AFTER I took the pic.\n\nI asked for a ticket to a different show the next night.  When they didn't have any tickets for that night the manager who was letting people in through the line came over and told the cashier that she had asked me what night I wanted tickets for and that I had told her 'tonight'. I thought that was interesting given the fact that she never asked me that question at all - she simple said what show are you wanting to see.  Then she told me \""you don't remember\"".  I think the heat must be getting to her. \n\nIn summary, if you don't mind standing in whats probably the slowest line Vegas, putting up with rude staff, seriously baking in the heat, and sitting in second rate seats all to save a few bucks  - good luck."
1,"Awesome burgers and great brews. Try the Rochefort 6, a great Belgian beer that I'll be looking for in the future."
1,"I don't care if Costco signals the general decline of humanity - I love it. It's a huge chain and I love it and regularly spend hours there strolling the aisles, tasting the samples, calculating the per item cost/value ratios. Okay I guess that's no surprise coming from the President of the Grocery Store Fan Club. \n\nI've not been to other Costcos in Arizona, but this is the first time I've seen one with a gas station. Yay! I don't mind saving a few cents off each gallon especially now when gas prices yo-yo faster than the stock market. Costco is THE place to go when you are setting up a home for the first time. I would know. I got everything from laundry detergent, books, food, camisoles and even a patio set here. \n\nAnd though navigating the parking lot on a Saturday is akin to wading through the fourth ring of hell, you can basically eat a free meal with the absurd amount of samples being handed out. One saturday I had lox on bagels, guacamole and tortilla chips, snack mix, pasta with an artichoke alfredo sauce and angelfood cake topped with whipped cream and a strawberry. yay! I've heard their churros are also yummy but have never eaten at the little cafe. clearly there's no need to."
0,"I normally don't post reviews on Yelp, but I was so shocked by the customer service that I just received. I used to come here quite a bit when they opened a few years ago, but ever since I moved across town I really didn't want to take the drive. My sister ordered cupcakes and I got a dozen dossants, the snotty associate rolled her eyes when we asked how many cupcakes we still needed to get a dozen, and didn't want to make us anymore cupcakes since we were basically going to wipe out the cupcakes that were already out. Never will I go back to this place...."
1,"Super cute clothes, super cheap prices!\n\nI absolutely love little boutiques like this with non-boutique prices :)"
1,"i finally finally made it to panevino! i always heard people gush about it and i pass it everyday but never got a chance to try it.. the restaurant was extremely impressive. modern architechture inside and modern decor as well. the view of the strip from the restaurant is amazing, and the ambiance was very relaxing.\n\nthe food was even better than i thought. the minestrone was the best i have ever had. really well made.. truly italian.the filet mignon was unbelievable! one of the best steaks ive had. cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth. youll wish you could have five more of them. its sooo good! i tried the lobster ravioli and omg it was heavenly. lobster and ravioli ratio was just right and the sauce was really good. i tried my friends pasta with seafood and it was amazing as well. perfect sauce perfect linguini. \n\npanevino is definitely one everybody should try at least once. it is a little pricey... actually its very pricey but its worth every penny. the food is soo good you will keep dreaming about it til the next time you go back. it is the perfect date place. so romantic, excellent views and relaxing ambiance. and kudos that the manager is there and is an honest to goodness italian man. if you're fluent in italian you can talk to him and tell him how great his place is."
1,"Great place. Must go at least once! Great food, great service, great atmosphere. \n\nReasons I gave it 4 stars: first reason is that well there is always better somewhere haha.... Also, when we were in there tonight, there was group of 12 people that decided to scream and talk over each other. Extremely rude. However that I'm sure is not usual for this place. It was a great time. Would have been better if those 12 knew how to act in public."
0,"NOT GOOD. with so many other options in town, there is no reason to eat at Macayo's. I understand that this restaurant caters to folks looking for a Tex-Mex style food. What I don't understand is how it can be so below average. They cover all of their food in cheese whiz (gross). I have been informed that Macayo's is a local favorite, and has been serving Las Vegas for years. It's time to move on people."
0,"Starting with the good first: The atmosphere was very nice. It was a little louder than I anticipated for a nicer place but completely ok. I loved the decor and the general idea of the place. The staff were nice...a bit too eager to have us like the place but they were nice.\n\nTheir juices were also good.\n\nThe bad: the vegan and vegetarian options were pretty bland. They used a lot of sauces to compensate for the lack of flavor in the food. I think part of the beauty of vegetarian, especially vegan plates is letting the natural food speak for itself. You can find better options around town. However, this place is nice for a group of vegans/vegetarians to go to as it offers more options on one menu rather than hitting up a regular restaurant and everyone has to order the same thing since it's the only available option on their menu.\n\nWould I go again? Once in a blue moon and only if I'm on that side of town."
0,"It could just have been lunch, but I was really disappointed.  I had been here for dinner 4 times and every time I had dinner there, it was stellar.  This time around we went for lunch and it really was borderline.  Not very good at all.  \n\nAll of the hot food came out cold.  The service was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The flatbread was soggy and they call it a flambe\u00e9, but it's a flatbread.  \nThe tuna tacos was meh...  the shell was cold.  We serve our shells hot, which tastes so much better.  The  manchego salad with shrimp was the best item we had, but the salad was $20 and was no more than a 9\"" plate.  Not worth the price.  I am not an elcheapo for good food.  I will pay any amount, if the food is good, but this salad was not worth $20.  \n\nThe honey coriander sauce on the braised short rib was way too sweet and we had a salmon dish with cucumbers and dill sauce.  It was good, but cold.  \n\nOverall - don't go for lunch.  There was only 3 tables in there at 11:30a-1p.  No wonder..... I should have taken that hint.  Don't go if the crowd at Mandalay is not going there.  BorderGrill was packed for lunch.  I wish we had went there.  \n\nI may give dinner another try, as it was real good, but will certainly stay away from lunch."
1,"Sex on bread! My friend and I discovered this gem while going to Moreno's and figured we would give it a shot. The Torta Dominicana is a coma inducing pile of awesome served on hot fresh bread. Imagine this please! Breaded steak, ham, refried beans, avocado, tomato, grilled chilis, and onions stacked high and blessed with hot sauce. Thinking about it takes me to my happy-place and makes the back of my head sweat (just like the sandwiches). Definitely try the Dominicana with breaded chicken instead of beef. It won't just knock your socks off, it will knock you out, steal your socks and point and laugh at you the whole time"
1,"***This Walgreens is huge and even upscale; it also has everything you need whether you forgot a travel toiletry or you need snacks or drinks for an impromptu party on The Strip; prices are higher than your typical Walgreens in other cities, but this Walgreens is still much cheaper than buying the same stuff at one of the casino gift shops***\n\nThis Walgreens does not have its own free parking lot, but there is plenty of free self and valet parking to be found at the major casinos on The Strip."
1,Fantastic steaks & the service was awesome. Had dinner & also brunch. I liked the dinner menu more but brunch was great too. Portobello fries are outstanding. Can't wait to go back.
1,This place is so great I have it on speed dial! My go to is the chicken kabobs with rice and salad.
1,"This was the first place I ate at when arriving to Montreal!!! Wow! The restaurant has an old school diner feel, and I believe the original owner still works here to seat the guests!\n\nThe omelette I had here was the best I've had! It is a very busy place so if you're a big group it may be challenging to get a table but definitely worth trying if you've never been. i will be coming back for sure!\n\nFood -  Great\nService - Friendly and quick\nAmbiance - Old school diner\nWorth the money - Yes!"
0,"I've tried to do business with this Day Subaru location, as well as the one in Moon.  Neither one, in my opinion is a very customer-friendly dealership, and both are out of the market on pricing.  I think there are much better options in the area.  The sales staff seems to be on average as far as product knowledge, but they don't have much else going for them.  The pricing is not competitive."
0,"We called Old Republic Home warranty 3 weeks ago because the fridge was on the blink, they sent out Reliable Repair. Reliable called the day before and said between 10 and 2, got there at 3:30.\nI had vacuumed the condenser on the fridge that morning so it was a bit cool when he got there, after looking at it for about a minute, he said it was working fine. The service guy was nice, and he also looked at the range and ordered a part.\nA day or two later the office called me and asked about the fridge so they could order parts?\nThe next week Reliable called to install the range part, they would be there between 12 and 4, it was closer to 4 when they got here. He replace the burner on the range and looker at the fridge and said it was still fine.\nNot once did he check the temp. in the fridge. Well, this Monday after doing our shopping on Sunday, we get up and there is water running out of the fridge, everything we bought on Sunday was melted and running out the bottom of the doors. We called back in an Reliable said they would come back out on Thursday. Today they called and said between 2 and 6, I ask them why so late and why it's not sooner wham it's a recall. I told them that if they have already been here twice that I should be looked at as soon as possible not at 6 pm 4 days later.\nThe girl started telling me how lucky I was they were coming back and doing a \""Free\"" recheck.\nI explained to her it was not free, I had paid $500 to Old Republic and had already paid for a service call.\nShe insisted that I was making out because of the \""Free\"" service call.\nIt made no difference to her that the fridge had been out for weeks.\nI told her what I thought..\nSoon there after I get a call from Khan from Old Republic, he starts asking about the fridge and why he should send anyone out. \""Because it's broken Khan\"" I told him I had moved the fridge into the dinning room and brought a loaner fridge in to keep things cold. He told me I  had to put the broken fridge back in it's covey hole or they would not work on it.\nI explained how hard it is to get to the broken fridge in the covey hole and how it could lead to other damage to the floor and carpet, he didn't care.\nHe also told me that if they damaged the floor or soiled the carpet in the adjoining room that he would take no responsibility for it.\nHe went on give me some good news and say that Reliable refused to come back out...GOOD, they did nothing and cost me a bunch of food.\nIt looks like both Old Republic and Reliable Repair are both 1 Star Companies and I can not recommend either for your home."

0,"I was first excited to try out some Portuguese food in Las Vegas because part of my family is portuguese and I am familiar with some of the Portuguese dishes. The Bacalhau A Brass is the typical dish I like to order everywhere I go. Although the picture from Vila Algarve menu looked like an original Bacalhau A Brass, the served dish did not look or taste anything like its description. It pretty much looked and tasted like mashed potatoes with a slight hint of cod fish. It only had two decorative olives which  did not resemble menu picture and does not meet traditional standards. The dish would be nicer if they were generous on the cod and the olives. The plate was way overpriced and the dish was pretty much tasteless. I don't think I set my expectations too high since this is a standard Portuguese dish and I had never encountered a bad one."
0,"Can do way better. Service sucks. Definitely needs to be cleaned up way more. It's pretty ghetto, here. Definitely don't gamble here"
1,"The staff at Joleon Salon does an amazing job on my color and cut every six weeks.  So when it was time for me to choose a place for bridesmaids to get their  hair and make and make up done for my special day, I chose Joleon Salon and day spa. They  did an amazing job on my hair and makeup for the bridesmaids and myself.   The Hairstylist and make up crew met us at Rainbow Gardens at 7am and their timing was perfect. By the time they finished my makeup the limo arrived:) They made sure we looked Beautiful.  Andrea was there to make sure everything was going according to schedule, and that everything was perfect. I would definitely recommend this company to all brides"
0,"Went to checkers on a friends recommendation that they used to eat it all the time in California. I will start off by saying that the food is ok hence the one star, if I could give this place a 0 stars i still would give just the one star for the food. \n\nThe reason for the 4 star reduction is because of napkins and 3 stars because of the really crappy engineered drive through. Its the thinnest drive thru we have ever driven through. we made a wide right hand turn from the pick up window and still scraped our rim. Ok so I thought maybe we are just somewhat retarded and decided to eat our food in the car and watch other cars and how they navigate what I felt was crappy design. It took us 15 minutes to eat our food and in that time frame we counted 22 cars, 14 of them being Suvs out of the 14 suvs 9 of them hit the curb or ran over it. The other 8 vehicles 3 hit the curb. \n\nI would never ever recommend this place to anyone especially anyone who cares about their cars. If someone from Checkers reads this, I really think you guys need to redesign that drive thru."
1,"Stepped in here on the request of my husband and was pleasantly thrilled at the place. This is a great aviary place. a lot of the birds that were surrended by their previous owners, some are 2nd or 3rd home birds.\n\nThey have small birds as well as large Macaws. some of the birds have health issues that they are being treated for from either poor nutrition, or environment issues so some have no feathers which is sad.\n\nthey have lots of toys to purchase and treats and they offer free classes to educate people on birds behavior and activities. \n\ntheir birds are available for adoption, and they also offer boarding services. If you own a bird this is a great place to stop in and check out"
1,Everything you could want from a small Mexican restaurant. No frills and amazing food prepared quickly and for a good price. Love it!
1,"Service here is always prompt, thoughtful(suggestions galore) and steady... and valet parking is a short stroll from the nearby Aria entrance. The ambiance is airy and open, and the bar setup (fruit instead of fake tapas) is witty and hip for a tapas-style spot. \n\nTapas: I begin each meal with a cheese plate(highly recommended) or the pan manchego? So far, I most enjoy the salmon with truffle(I often order two) and some other seafood dish I cannot presently recall. Lobster gazpacho is a must for those who(like moi) generally hate gazpacho or cold blends. Other notables, thus far: raspberry tuna dish(it actually works!), lobster salad, huevos estrellados, bass(Oprah-aaaaammazing, lol!), chorizo. The flan here is intricate and delicious.\n\nOne dish I hate here is the steak featured on the tapas menu. It tasted like mediocre sirloin... I admittedly--owing to its horrible texture--consider sirloin essentially dog food. I've never tried the paella but was informed that it tastes just like Spain's, which is not a good thing. To explain: paella(with or without saffron) is a stupid idea. Simply read the ingredients/preparation and you will sigh with comprehension... I call paella culinary meth, lol. If you insist on an entree the filet mignon(or I imagine any seafood or pork dish here) is a pleaser.\n\nImpeccable texture and taste overcome (merely above average) presentation at this spot--one of my faves for lunch or silly dinners. On my last visit, I enjoyed a quick bite/wine at the bar with friends. I have yet to try the early eve special but it sounds like a killer deal.    \n\n4 stars rather than 5 because some of the flavors repeat (a few dishes beg for drizzles; others for acidity to combat the olive oil and make things more spanish and less greek); however, I wish I could give 4.5 stars b/c they serve tender octopus And delicious fried calamari that doesn't even need the sauce or lemons."
0,"The place was  pretty busy on a Thursday night so I had some high hopes but in this case Yelps overall rating is about right - to a little generous if you are into food even just a little.\n\n\nWe ordered oysters on the half shell and while they tasted fine enough they served them to us covered with ice... Ah yeah, just a little presentation issue.\n\nI then ordered one of their specials the sea bass with veggies.  About a 3\"" x 3\"" 1/2\"" thick piece...  The fish tasted fine but the veggies were sad steamed limp gross looking things.   Again, the presentation was horrendous.  Just a piece of fish and some nasty veggies I wouldn't serve my dog.\n\nThe chowder was the best thing I had here.\n\nI wouldn't waste my time or money here unless you know what you're getting into.  If you're looking for fried food I'm sure this will fit the bill.\n\nOur Server did a good job and treated us well."
0,"We looked at a lot of reviews before we left, so we knew it was old and run-down before we got there. But it was cheap - $65 and $75 a night - and centrally located. So we decided we would just put up with it.\n\nThe rooms looked like there were straight off the set of the Golden Girls, but like a crappier more ghetto version of the show.\n\nThe hallway was dank. It was obvious they'd had a pretty major leak in the recent past. By \""recent\"" I mean possibly a year ago. It just smelled like a basement, and feet.\n\nOur room had a beautiful view of the roof full of air conditioners below. Our friend was lucky enough to get a room across the hall, so it at least overlooked the pool.\n\nThe bar staff pretty much sucked. If you were playing the slots the servers took foreeeeeeever to take your orders, and then another millenium to actually bring you your drink. I'm pretty sure I aged a couple of years while waiting.\n\nIf you happened to have spent your money by the time she got back or you just wanted to move machines, tough luck, you're not getting your drink! And she will make you feel like a turd for asking for it.\n\nTired of the slowpoke service, we headed to the bar. The bartender was also a condescending a-hole. The rail drinks tasted like dissolved pills mixed with rad fluid. \n\nI'm sure they whole crappy service / crappy drinks scenario is engineered so that you just buy your drinks. Didn't work. We just brought down drinks from our room.\n\nOh, and I'm giving one star because a) I have to, and b) the \""dealertainers\"" are creepily awesome."
0,"This place is awful, the service is so slow. Coming frmo NYC I expected a deli to be rather fast. Instead it took over 10 mins for them to make my sandwich. The Tuna did not taste fresh and the sandwiches were expensive. For the same price I probably could have had a nice sit down meal.\n\nThey really need to improve this food court, especially the delivery time. This was the first and last time I ever ate at a food court in Vegas. I rather just have the olives of my martini if i'm looking for a quick bite,"
1,"My FAVORITE place to get my nails done (I drive from North Scottsdale here every two weeks) They are always creative and do great gel. (If you like glitter, ask to see the loose glitter they put on nails... so pretty) The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because it IS just a little pricey.... and I've noticed sometimes inconsistent pricing from person to person so you never really know what you're going to pay. All in all it's worth the drive and price to me."
1,"This is a small centre with just enough - the cinema - been there a few times, Weatherspoons - has great Curry Club on Thursdays (fish and chips on Fri) and a a variety of restaurants - its close to city centre and next door to the Edinburgh Playhouse and across the street from John Lewis."
0,"I have been to this location many times to get propane in my truck, and every single time, I have left there feeling very frustrated. To get propane, you pull up to the propane tank area and ring a doorbell to let the employees know that you need assistance. There is no way to communicate with the employees without going into the building, and you can not see to the inside from the propane tank area. There is no way of knowing if the bell worked after pressing the button, and no way of knowing if anyone is at the register area to hear it.\n\nI have never waited less than five minutes for someone to respond at this location, and today it took me more than 25 minutes to get out of there. I went inside the building and could not find ANYONE manning the 'store' and no way to signal or summon anyone, but many employees were standing around in back. I called out to the nearest one, who was cleaning a truck, and told him I needed help. He said he would send someone out, so I went back to my truck to wait. Another five minutes passed, and the same employee drove the truck I had just seen him cleaning to the front. I made him aware that I was STILL waiting, and he said he would send someone. Another five minutes and I felt like I was being held hostage. not being able to leave because my tank was empty and I didn't know if I could make it to another station that sold propane. Yet another employee drove a truck to the front, and I let HIM know I had been waiting a very long time, and he said he would send someone out. Oy. \n\nAfter waiting in 104F heat, someone FINALLY came out and filled my tank, and then the \""pay at the pump\"" gadget failed to work, and I was asked to go inside again to pay. Once inside there was some other computer problem and I had to wait another few minutes for that to get sorted out. Twenty-five minutes to get gas in my truck is ridiculous.  I have never rented a truck from this location, so I can't speak for their customer service in that area, but I will NOT be using this location again except in cases of extreme emergency. VERY disappointed with my experiences here. \n\nLuckily I work near the Gilbert location, and their customer service is outstanding. I will have to arrange my schedule to fill up there from now on."
1,"We drove by this place quite a few times, so we decided to check it out.  I've went to Petes Fish N' Chips before and it was disappointing.  So coming here I thought I was gonna be a little disappointed.  Before you actually get the food, you think that it was gonna be real pricy. I ended up getting 4 piece fish and 4 shrimp ($9.99) with my sides being mac n' cheese and fries.\n\nThe food did take a little while to come out (if you know me, that stuff doesn't bother me, I'm patient like that) but when I got the box, it was so full that they couldn't even close it all the way (good thing it wasn't to go).  I opened the box and the fish was big.  The fries and mac n' cheese were under the fish, oh yeah and hush puppies.  Overall they give you a real good size proportion that fills even people like me up.\n\nNow the fish didn't have a super fishy taste, but it was better than Long Johns and even Petes Fish N' Chips.  The shrimp was delicious, the mac n' cheese was decent, and the fries were tasty. It was our first time, and we even told the cashier.  Even though the meal was a 4 piece fish n' shrimp, they ended up giving us 5 pieces of fish, which was pretty cool on their end.\n\nThe customer service was nice and friendly, and even the cashier was cleaning when it wasn't busy.  You don't see that much nowadays.  This so far is the best fast food seafood place I've been too, and those are hard to find in AZ."
1,"I was suprised this was in a nonedescript strip mall but had such panache! The food was delicious. I thought the guac was outstanding. The carne asada taco with a flour tortilla (yay) was very tasty and the Inca Salad was divinity. The salad had such a combination of textures;  quinioa, nuts, avo- with a citrussy vinegrette that was so so good.\n\nWe will definitely return. The Happy Hour pricing was a treat on the weekend!"
1,"This one is specific to the steakhouse. While the prices are a bit high, it is expected since it is a tourist attraction and does have the additional cost of being a \""Old West\"" attraction.  That being said, they had a $10 - 10oz deal on fillet or strip steak.  The sides are not the most exciting, but the steaks here have a great flavor and mine have always come cooked to temp.  AND you get great live music (mostly country and western, but they throw in some others). I would recommend taking the kids and enjoy all Rawhide has to offer.\n\nNote- call and make a reservation, sometimes the place is wide open, others booked to capacity (tourist buses), so planning can help make sure you get a seat."
1,"On Friday night we had dinner at Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria, across from the Biltmore Fashion Park at 32nd St. and Camelback. It's a relatively new spin-off of Tomaso's Restaurant which has been at that location for 32 years. Where Tomaso's is upscale, dressier, and heavy on the proteins, Tommy V is casual and carb-oriented. It's interesting that the prices on most of the appetizers, salads and pastas are pretty much the same at both locations.\n\n     Tommy V's is divided up into two rooms. You enter the bar area which also houses an open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. It's light-filled and colorful. and also very loud. The second room is more sedate, and unfortunately somewhat gloomy. It's dimly lit, and the faux brick, dark wood, and taupe painted walls don't help. There are some windows cut into the front and back walls, framed with curtains, which look into the bar area, and a third back room. Very weird. However, the gloom was dispelled when our cheerful waitress brought us a basket of crusty bread and some fabulous pesto butter, redolent of garlic. She informed us that happy hour was on (from 5 - 7), and we could get most of the wines on the menu for $5 a glass or $20 a bottle. We decided to share a glass of red Primitivo 'Layer Cake' (I don't know why it was called that, but you knew that I wouldn't be able to resist ordering it). It turned out to be delicious, rich and deeply fruity. Because we had arrived quite early - I didn't know how busy the restaurant would be and reservations are only taken for tables of 6 - we ordered a roasted beet and goat cheese salad ($8) while we awaited our friends Walt and Maria. While it was quite good, it didn't live up to the one we had at The Parlor since the beets weren't multi-colored and the dressing didn't have as much zing. However, there was lots of cheese and toasted pistachios.\n\n     When Walt and Maria arrived, our bread basket and carafe of butter was swiftly refilled (the bussing was top notch). I suggested that they try the Primitivo, and they ordered the Romaine Wedge salad ($7) with bacon and gorgonzola. It was beautifully presented, with a pile of whole romaine leaves holding the accompaniments and dressing. All the salad ingredients were quite fresh. I ordered an Eggplant Torta ($15), described as \""Baked Multi-layer of Eggplant, Cheese Fondue, Pasta\"". Ken opted for V's Kick Ass Burger 9 oz ($12) - \""Handcrafted with Short Rib, Brisket & Kobe Beef, Caramelized Onions, Heirloom Tomatoes, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Arugula, Truffle Aioli & Parmesan Herb Roasted Potatoes\"". The combination of meats made this too interesting to pass up. Walt and Maria decided to share a pizza. These are \""personal size\"", 10 - 12 inches, and range in price from $10 for a Margherita with mozzarella and tomatoes to \n$16 for a Proscuitto and Fig pie with gorgonzola and arugula. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind they had, but they said they enjoyed it, and it was actually big enough that 2 pieces were taken home. The burger was great. It was big and juicy with a fascinating texture because of the short ribs and brisket - it's now my favorite Phoenix burger, and the price is comparable to the other good ones served elsewhere. Ken loved the roasted potatoes, and while they were flavorful, I prefer nice crunchy fries. My eggplant torta was a pleasant, non-confrontational variant of eggplant parmesan. But having taken a Zantac, I was looking forward to confrontation - a spicy sauce and loads of gooey cheese. This was disappointing, but edible. It was also a fairy small portion.\n\n     There were no surprises on the dessert menu - tiramisu, cannoli, etc. We ordered a tartufo for the table. When it arrived, nicely sliced, there was none of the zablione promised on the menu. I asked the waitress about that and she tried to tell me that it had been \""mixed in\"". When I gave her a skeptical, unhappy look she brought over the owner/manager (I'm not sure which he was), and he apologized, saying that there's been a dispute with the distributor over that item. We weren't charged for it, which was very nice, since we did eat it all.\n\n     The parking in front of the restaurant is limited, but Walt said to tell you that immediately to the east of the strip mall containing the restaurant there's a large parking lot, not particularly visible to the street. All in all I'd say this was a good dining experience and we'll go back to try some of the interesting pastas like braised short rib gnocchi ($20) or butternut squash ravioli with amaretto cookies, toasted almonds and parmigiano sage sauce ($15). And especially to have another burger!!"

0,"First impression of Kaba Curry was not good. Our little family walked in an hour and a half before closing and all we saw was a HUGE group of guys waiting for their meal. And when I say huge, I mean they took up like half the restaurant. I knew we were going to have somewhat of a wait because there were no plates in front of them. There wasn't a sign that said to seat yourself, so we waited by the counter. There was a man behind the counter talking to another man (one of the patrons) and I'd say it took a good FIVE minutes for him to even acknowledge us..... and we were standing right in front of him. My boyfriend gave me the \""let's just walk out\"" look but this place has been blasting my IG newsfeed so I wanted to see the hype. \n\nWhen we were finally able to order, there was a list of stuff they had ran out of, so we had to rethink our decisions. (ugh) We waited a good 20-25 minutes for our food but it was nice and piping hot. The curry was OK. I think we prefer Indian curry so it may just be a preference thing. My BF ate the food, but I don't think he'll want to eat it again. The concept is great and they offer very creative toppings and sides to go along with the curry, but like I said, it may just be a preference thing. I would give the food a 3/4 but have to downgrade to a 2 because of the initial service. Perhaps I'll visit again and update after....."

1,"I agree with Ebony that sometimes Red Lobster does get a bad rap....but this location is a very good one......as long as you get here early (LOL). This locale is always busy.....but the food.....customer service....and the overall ambience of the place really shines. Molly was our server when the wife and I visited this locale for dinner this past Friday night. Right now they have a 15 dollar 4 course meal promotion.....and I am telling you it was the best 15 bucks I have ever spent. I started with the New England Clam chowder.....this is my favorite soup in the whole world BAR NONE. Then I had the Caesar Salad with the Cheddar Bay biscuits which I always have two baskets of ....because those Biscuits will really make you hurt someone they are so good......(LOL). I had the Shrimp and Grilled Chicken in a great garlic and butter sauce with garlic mashed potatoes.....OMG.....the chicken was so juicy and the potatoes just melted in my mouth.\n\nDessert was a very rich and delicious Key Lime Pie......ALL THIS FOR 15 BUCKS......WOW. I felt like I was stealing in a way (LOL) but again if there is a better deal in the valley for a dinner this good.....please let me know. So run don't walk to you nearest neighborhood Red Lobster and try this deal before it's gone. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"
0,"This place is such a rip off it's actually so disrespectful. Ordered a smoked salmon on bagel plate, and it didn't come with cream cheese. When I asked for some cream cheese, they gave me a small packet of philadelphia cream cheese and charged me $2 for it. No, they did not let me know beforehand that they'd charge me $2 for one packet of factory made cream cheese. That happened a couple months ago, but today my friend told me that they charged her $2.50 for a side of sour cream without teling her beforehand, so it motivated me to actually write about this stuff on Yelp.\n\nThe actual food is good, although truly overpriced. I just really find this sneakily charging outrageous prices for sauces so disrespectful to its customers."
1,"A few friends and I recently took a trip to Vegas. The only place my boyfriend NEEDED to go to was Bouchon, as he is obsessed with Thomas Keller. Someday we are going to make a trip to California specifically for French Laundry... But anyway! \n\nWe had brunch here and it was beyond phenomenal. We started off with the mussels and words cannot describe them. We thought we ordered the dozen but instead we were brought the larger portion and it's a good thing they did because we sucked them down. All together we ordered the steak frites, chicken and waffles, croque madame, and gravlax. I don't like salmon at all and I LOVED the gravlax. The croque madam was ok hot but got sort of unbearable when it cooled. I wish I would have got something else bit oh well. Other than that everything was great! It was one of my friend's birthday so at the end if the meal they brought her a complimentary Lemon tart of some kind. WOW!!!  \n\nThe service was amazing as well. We never went without water or drinks, and they were so stealthy. To this day my friends and I reminisce about how much food we got and how good it was."
0,"I am SO glad i didn't listen to my friends and booked a dinner at Rushi Roku as well while I was in town.  My friends are Phoenix/Scottsadle locals and told me that Ra is the place to be, but after we had a girls lunch here, I am so glad I didn't have dinner here as well.\n\nThe decor is standard but the food is pretty average.  However, the prices are very reasonable for lunch.  They have this huge fruity alcoholic that's fun to share.  The food was pretty average - I had some unagi sushi, shared the skewer appetizers, and had a sushi/sashimi box for lunch.\n\nI was disappointed since our friends were raving about this place, but then again, they're not really sushi eaters (more of the California roll types).  For people who like sushi/sashimi, I would go elsewhere if you're looking for more unique fishes like yellowtail, etc... - you will get better quality elsewhere."

I wasn't feeling well so I didn't try very much, but what I did try was so good, especially one with sea salt.  Sea salt and chocolate are kind of a problem for me when they join forces.  Sooo delicious. \n\nBUT what stood out to me that day (in 100+ degree Vegas heat where we'd already had BEAUTIFUL pastries purchased from another store MELT just from walking outside for a bit!!) was they offer you ice packs to put around your chocolate purchase in case you will be heading outside. Brilliant! I wish the bakery I'd gone to had done the same!"

0,"This was my second visit and alas, my last. \n\nOur first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.\n\nIt was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was \""Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.\"" WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert. \n\nOur first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1."

1,"Every time I make a Vegas trip I hit up this place on the way out. This is so far the closest thing in BBQ away from Memphis.

1,"This place rocks and is good for kids and adults alike. My husband has been coming her for a while and has always gotten a great cut. He has a longer hairstyle and a thick beard. So many other barbers are hit and miss with quality depending on who you get, but this place delivers every time. Since my husband has had such a great experience, when it was time for our son's first haircut we chose to come here. This place isn't necessarily geared toward kids, but the guy who cut my sons hair did a fabulous job. My 1.5 year old son wiggled around pretty much the entire cut, and the barber was super nice and understanding. I was impressed at how fast the barber cut my sons hair, which is also a big plus with a wiggly toddler. Thank you for making my son's first cut a positive experience, we will be back!"

Our complaints to the idiot server did nothing  In the end we had to scrap the salt off of the various dishes in order to eat them  At the end of this awful meal someone (possibly the manager) offered us 5 truffles  because she was told about our complaint.\n\nI am so disgusted that I cannot stand to look at Mario Batali when he shows up on the TV."

I have never written a negative review on any business, but they are liars and have the worst customer service once they have your money. \n I wasn't ready to enroll because I was having back pain and didn't know how long it would last, but JUSTIN talked to JOHN HOLMES the GM there and they said they would give me a 10 day no obligation trial.  After 6 days I still had the pain and my husband injured his food so I decided I better cancel and try again when we can actually get in there.  Unfortunately JOHN MALCOVE (another manager) was insistant that there's no such thing as a 10 day trial, only a 3 or 7 day trial.  Talked to member services and after a week of research they said they have to take their word against mine.  So I'm out not only the $50 enrollment, but first and last month fee for both my husband and I.  Almost $200 for nothing!  Thanks LA fitness."
0,"I love anime and games, but this store is lackluster and overpriced.\n\nAs soon as I heard about this place I knew I wanted to check it out. I'm an anime fan, even if not to the extent of some of the people around this town you see dressed up at the conventions. If a shop opens up carrying anime stuff, you can rest assured I'm bound to check it out eventually.\n\nAfter finally getting a chance to check it out, though, I am severely disappointed.\n\nAs soon as I walked into the store I was greeted by a girl dressed as Princess Peach (from the Mario series), so you can tell they are fans, which is good at least. As soon as I entered, I took a lap around the store looking to find their selections of anime DVDs, And another lap. And another.\n\nTHE STORE DOES NOT HAVE ANY ANIME DVDS.\n\nAre you kidding me? The whole reason I go into an anime store is to collect discs of my favorite titles or discover new ones. An anime store that does not stock anime DVDs is like Pizza Hut deciding they are not going to sell pizza anymore. They also do not carry any actual video games (it is not clear if they intend to stock any of this material in the future, but if they are not, they need to reconsider.)\n\nThey do have some cool memorabilia (cosplay props, household items, keychains, collectables, figures, etc.), but nearly all of it is severely overpriced. The Dragon Ball Z Scouters (AKA the things people war on their faces to tell power levels) cost over $10 more here than they do at Tokyo Discount. And Tokyo Discount has stores on both end of town, with no hectic Town Center parking or traffic.\n\nI was so eagerly looking forward to visiting Anime Revolution, but a revolution this is not. When it comes to anime and anime accessories, just go to Tokyo Discount instead. They actually have anime DVDs, and have a better selection of memorabilia, most of which is priced fairer. Stop in if you're at Town Square anyway, but do not make a separate trip just to go here."

Cadillac ranch has Happy Hour all night on Monday, so it was 1/2 price drinks and appetizers for as long as you stayed. Being a huge soft pretzel fan, that's where my money went tonight. Originally $8.99, these are really, really good, but probably not for full price. Two huge hot pretzels and a very unique dipping sauce which was a vat of cream cheese fondue. It was a dreamy combination. They also have a huge projector screen TV in the middle of bar and an outdoor and indoor bar. Nice place for happy hour and football, especially on Monday's."

The spaghetti noodles looked like they had been sitting there for quite a while, the gravy had a thick film on it and the mashed potatos were dry and crusty. The fried chicken was cold and the salad bar looked like it had been sitting for 3 days, the broccoli was brown on top. \nMy daughter and I both agreed that the drinks were good, and went to eat elsewhere. \nI never expect much from buffet joints, but this place was much worse than any buffet that I have ever been to.\nThe staff was friendly, but sadly the food was old and unappetizing looking."
0,I am a first time   Eater at churches. I walked in and everybody turned around behind the counter and looked at me and didn't say anything. I waited there for about five minutes for somebody to even say something to me. When a group of black people walked in after me they were like hey what's up welcome to churches. I am a white female. Two more parties of black people walk in after me. They said something to each of those parties each! I've been ordered the three-piece with two sides now. He didn't bring it up wrong and I asked her mashed potatoes no gravy he clearly saw that there was gravy on - potatoes and still put it in the bag. So then I had to pull it out and give it back to him to make a point of him to give me the right things that I ordered. I will never ever ever going to that church is taking again because of the racism that I felt was there and it the horrible fucking service. I've been asked for Honey he just told me that there was no honey left so I just walked out he never gave me a receipt and I will never go back.  Hands-down the worst eating experience I've ever had
0,"The Orleans Showroom is a nice venue where nearly every seat is a good one.  The sound is great and the stage is pretty huge.  I have seen a dozen shows there and staff for the most part are helpful.\n\nMost recent experience is folks coming from the back- the cheap seats and block views from the higher paying seats.  Please don't sell $113 seats and let the folks from the $30 block the view. I get it- people like to get up and dance- a good song comes on and people get excited but Ushers please do your job.\n\nI asked the usher to ask people to go back to their seats because they were blocking the view.  The Usher said \""It sucks doesn't it?\""  Yes, sir, it sucks when you don't do your job.\n\nNormally a nice venue but Management- please manage."
0,"I came here once before about 2 years ago and had the cheese enchiladas and thought it was good. I just recently came here and realized that this restaurant is not very authentic Mexican food but is targeted to the more Caucasian crowd. I don't mean any offense but, the food is not spicy, even though they say it is. The tacos had very little meat and te cheese enchiladas were a lot of cheese, and the tamales had no flavor. \nThe prices for the meal are not outrageous but not consistent with what you order. \n\nAs for the staff they are not very friendly and come off as if they don't care what the customer thinks. We were served by a guy of the name Moreno (that's what the ticket says and I'm not sure because he didn't have a name tag.) he never checked to see how our food was and hardly walked around to other tables to see how they were doing. He took more time trying to get a black folder to give our ticket and walking around us with our ticket rather than givin it to is directly. As for the bus/water boy was doing an amazing job clearing tables and all the duties that Moreno couldn't do. \n\nI almost forgot about the cheese crisp. It was very greasy but oddly the tortilla was hard and cardboard like. It was gross."
1,"Redbeard's has long been a place which I frequent. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007 I've been coming here (not sure why so many out of town people think its new, its far from new). They have a pretty good selection of beer. I wouldn't say they are a craft beer emporium or anything like that, but at least they value brews other than Coors Light and Bud Light.\n\nTheir menu has a pretty good variety of items on it. They do some more restaurant/dinner type entrees throughout the week as well. I would not say their wings are the best in da 'Burgh, but they are pretty good.\n\nThey recently revamped their menu and increased their prices(having worked in the restaurant industry for many years I understand the need to do this), but it seems they took off some our favorite items. For that I have to give it 4 stars.\n\nThey have a great outdoor seating area which is open almost year round. Others have complained about the loud music. I would agree. The music can be loud, but its  a bar folks!! If you want to watch the Pens, Steelers or Pirates play, you certainly can. Sit in the bar area and the volume is usually pretty loud.\n\nThey have a nice dining room for a bar too. You can request to sit in the far back room if its a more quite atmosphere in which you seek.\n\nI recommend the chicken quesodilla or a burger. Just watch out, its build your own burger and they charge for each topping, but please, don't bark about the price. We all know you can make a burger at home for a buck or two(its one of the best money makers for a restaurant)."
0,"This Dunkin' Donuts is a hit or miss for me. After living on the East Coast for five years, I know what a true Dunkin' coffee tastes like... extra cream, extra extra sugar. They just can't seem to get it right here. Their coffee always tastes like bottom of the pot and their donut selection is lacking. One morning I pulled up to the drive thru at 8 am and they were out of Old Fashioned and Boston Kremes... I almost had a heart attack right.in.the.middle of the drive thru when the lady uttered the words \""We're out\"" and I looked at my car display that read \""8:00 am\""\n\nOther mornings I'll come and they'll be out of plain white bagels... I kid you not! Don't they keep frozen donuts and bagels on hand, you know in case of an apocalypse?"
1,"I still call this place \""Sylvia's\"" from its original name \""Sylvia's La Canasta.\""\n\nFood here is legit. And they have a fully stacked salsa and chip bar to hold you over until your food is ready. The seating area is comfortable and ample, stretching out into the shaded patio looking onto seventh ave. \n\nThe area is nothing to worry about. There are a couple of pockets near there that aren't the best but I wouldn't let it affect my decision to go there or not. . .\n\nWhen this place opened, it was a small corner store with a few regulars and a growing number of true believers. After a few years, its popularity began to soar so they expanded the restaurant and grew the seating areas. \n\nWhat can I say? I'm a softie for bootstraps success stories like this one. \n\nFood is delicious, authentic and cheap. I highly recommend swinging by for a daily lunch special, but the service and food are worth the trip around the clock."
0,"one of the advantages of doing your masters degree at age 33 is that you get to be surrounded by students ten years younger. that youth can be refreshing, enlightenting, de-aging. \n\nit can also lead to having to go to student bars and clubs when those students turn 22 and 23. they will plan their birthday parties at these same bars and clubs.  the advantage of these clubs is that they are often cheap. at stereo, drinks are 1.50.  they could be free, and stereo would easily be the worst club i have ever been to in my entire life.  dont get me wrong, i spent years of my youth going to clubs nearly as bad in other countries- cave themed clubs in mexico where you make out with waiters to get an extra tequila shot, clubs in torremolinos and cancun where foam shoots out of holes and girls pretend theyre bi and make out with eachother. \n\nthis club doesnt even offer that. it does offer possibly the worst dj i have ever heard in my life. a smelly smoke that shoots out at you from the dj stand in amounts that may give your first born an extra limb or cyclops eye.  its filled with high school and maybe first year univ kids whose hooking up, post club will directly lead to the dumbing down of future generations.  the only possible remedy for the horridness that is this club o shit is  that there are pool tables on the main floor. however as the volume of the shit music from above is still enough to make you contemplate suicide, it doesnt compensate sufficiently.\n\nif you have to go, drink at least 9 shots immediately before entering"
0,"Old school Las Vegas charm my butthole.  \n\nLets bullet point this:\n\n- The room was dustier than my apartment.\n- The staff was rude at best, terrifyingly weird at worst.\n- The food choices make you glad there's a Subway down the street.\n- The casino makes you glad you're surrounded by two million others.\n- All the annoying drunks tend to congregate on the patio outside Margaritaville\n- Their marquee performers are Donny and Marie, who should be deported to Afghanistan (and not to entertain our troops)\n- Terrible, overpriced bars.\n- Insane check in and check out lines.\n\nAnd now the pros:\n\n- It's cheap."
1,"After a first visit ever to a Famous Dave's a couple of weeks ago (in Mesa), it was time to try another location & see if this store could match the awesome experience I had at the other one, so I whipped over here for lunch today, this time joined by Mike C.\n\nTheir Lunch Specials give you plenty of great food for $8.99, but this time I went \""whole hog\"" & ordered the St. Louis Rib-N-Meat Combo, just for fun.  This brought out a feast of homemade style, seasoned potato chips, potato salad, Wilbur Beans, 5 meaty spare ribs and a leg & thigh of their barbecued Country Style Chicken, plus a corn muffin and whipped butter.\n\nThis was one of the more expensive ordering options on the regular menu at $16.99, but it was a big, delicious feast!\n\nI am going to give this visit one less star than the one to the other Famous Dave's because our server, \""Famous JIm\"", was pushy, upselling menu choices & repeatedly trying to get us to buy their gift cards."
1,"Reading the bad reviews for Zumanity made me want to right a great review.  I would gladly go see this show again, even though I know everything that will happen.  We went on our honeymoon and that show was a ridiculous amount of fun!  The performers are also extremely gracious.\n\nIf you are offended by tits, dildos, huge packages, fake fabric penises, etc.--just don't go.  Of COURSE there was crude humor.  It was raunchy!  AND FUN!\n\nThe costumes were great, the humor kept us laughing, and the acts were great!  Props to the fishbowl girls who didn't bust their faces open on the glass.  I was literally terrified that they would!  But Cirque du Soleil performers are amazeballs--end of story.\n\nGo.  It's not a waste of money.  If you don't believe me, buy from the half-price ticket booth set up near New York New York."
0,"Extremely old and outdated (you know, the feeling you get when you step into a grocery store like Von's or Albertson's and it was all original inside , never renovated?). I went here many times when I lived in the area, but haven't been back since (no reason, especially since I don't like it). If it was a popular movie, it would tend to get crowded since this is the only theater in the immediate area, especially during summer time."
1,"Love Chaya!  \n\nThey recently moved, so they now have a lot more room.  So if you have to wait for a table, it won't be nearly as long as it used to be.\n\nSushi is always fresh, tasty and very decently priced.  Rolls are a perfect size and the nigiri is a generous cut.  \n\nI have yet to have any of the other options (other than sushi) but from the reviews I have heard, they are excellent as well."
1,"I always buy the same thing when I go to a Mexican food restaurant: a bean burro, enchilada style (red sauce). It's a simple item, but it's my all-time favorite food. I thought the burro and the enchilada sauce were excellent. Having a side of beans with my bean burro sounds redundant, but they were yummy. I liked the rice as well. I also would have liked to order a burro by itself without getting the beans and rice. Eating too much wreaks havoc on my six-pack abs. Okay, I admit it. I actually have a one-pack, but it would be great to have the choice of getting items a la carte. I thought the chips, salsa, and red sauce were all good. All the servers and greeters were very friendly. I sat at the bar and watched the 2012 Summer Olympics as I ate. I think they had three (or four) flat screen TVs in the bar. On one of the TVs tonight, the Diamondbacks were playing the Dodgers. I hope La Fonda is successful at their new location. Including the tip, my bill was about $14.00. That is a tad steep for someone who really only wanted a bean burro, enchilada style. I will go back, but I'll have to reduce my normal number of visits because of the cost. I added some photos of my dinner and of the outside of La Fonda, which is located just east of McClintock Rd, on the south side of Baseline Rd."
0,"Maybe I'm getting too old to enjoy loud music - so loud you're basically yelling at the person sitting next to you - at 10 AM on a Saturday, but RnR wasn't for me. I feel like it's trying too hard to push for an experience that resonates of amazing, crazy, youthful, full of party animals, and outrageous, but it ends up feeling cheesy, forced, and a little more on the unpleasant side.\n\nThe menu is big, and drinks range from reasonably priced to whaaat? NO! There are some good bottomless brunch cocktail specials on the weekend. I didn't try the food so I can't really comment.\n\nAfter having one round, we left. I think given the right mindset (and time of day), RnR could be fun, but it'll be a good while before I give it another go."
1,This place has the best happy hour ever. I highly recommend the pork nachos. They are delicious and a steal at happy hour. The atmosphere is fun but can be a little loud.  The open layout is nicely done though.
0,"The catfish was awful. I don't know what I was thinking ordering catfish from a Philly place. I just saw the sign and couldn't help but order it.  They weren't prepped right (full of skin and fat)  and I couldn't wash away the nasty fatty fish taste out of my mouth. Even if the person wasn't on their phone the entire time, it wouldn't have tasted any better."
1,For a circle K this place has it going on 2nd Circle K that has impressed me. It's close to home so I drop in for a little H2O or the occasional snack.....
1,"I have to preface this by saying I went here years and years ago, and want to go back to see if the quality has held.  A colleague and I were in Montreal for a conference, and I heard the concierge tell a hotel guest about it.  The lobster, mango and avocado salad was excellent, and we chose to go back for three consecutive nights until we had to leave town, and, sadly, Restaurant Julien."
0,"I'm gonna keep this review short and simple.\n\nFood: 1/5\nService 1/5\n\nPork chop extremely overcooked (see pic)\nLobster Bisque: extremely salty\n\nService: had to ask for water refills, notified about soup and he said he would let the chef know, no other options for soup offered.\nPork chop was dry and hard told server (Dennis) and he just said \""oh\"" and walked away never to be seen again. Thanks Silverado steakhouse for the outstanding experience for my Christmas dinner. I will never step foot near your establishment again nor would I ever recommend you.\n\nYelpers beware!"
0,"I was craving korean bbq one night and decided I'd eat somewhere I've never been before, so I ended up at this place. I ordered a combo that came with some spicy tofu soup and a few pieces of short ribs for $18. The tofu soup honestly tasted like mildly spicy water, there was hardly any flavor. The short ribs were somewhat good. The whole time while I was eating, nobody came to my assistance asking if I needed anything else. Minutes later a young lady came and asked me to pay even when I wasn't even done with my food (I found this kind of rude). I told her I wanted to order something else because I was still kind of hungry, so I went and ordered some beef cubes which came out to be $28 (Pretty pricey for a plate with a few pieces of meat). She still insisted me on paying for my first meal and then pay for the other stuff later. The beef came out to be a little over cooked, there was no juiciness to it. The whole entire time, still, no one came to ask me if everything was okay. I wasn't too satisfied with the customer service. All in all, I could've gotten all you can eat korean bbq over at Korean Garden, Tofu Hut, or Sura for way less with better service. Don't think I'll be coming back."
1,"I love this place. It's probably the best thing that has happened to an airport. Just imagine a great place for food, not expensive, and inside an airport... Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There's an LGO.\n\nThere's already an LGO \""intersection\"" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it's inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.\n\nI love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It's worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You'll get there in like 2 minutes!\n\nThe food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You'll love that you did. :)"
0,"I have never been to a similar type of show as Reve. I actually bought the tickets thinking it is a cirque du soleil production, which it wasn't :-) There is lots of great acrobatics, and some pretty scenes and beautiful colors especially at the end when the flowers pop out of the ceiling. However the story line was not very clear, there was too much going on all the time which made it difficult to focus and truly enjoy. The synchronized swimming was actually not very synchronized all the time :-) \n\nMy 5 year old daughter was with me which was a big mistake. Most of the performers were half naked and if dressed they might as well have been naked, and frequent parts with suggestive dancing. NOT recommended in my opinion for kids below 13. Cannot comprehend why they would allow kids as young as 5 to enter. Found myself often wishing it would end soon so I could get out!\n\nThe stage is nice, theater is nice, but overall, I thought it was a waste of money. Not my cup of tea."
0,"Les brunch qu'ils servent ne sont pas \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 la poubelle ce qui signifie que les plats sont assez bons. Cependant, il n'y a rien d'exceptionnel et il existe des places pour d\u00e9guster de bien plus m\u00e9morables brunchs.\nParfois, pour certains restaurants, on ne ressent pas qu'il s'agit d'une cha\u00eene. Or, l\u00e0... on le ressent grandement dans le service, dans la mani\u00e8re dont c'est g\u00e9rer, etc.\nIl y a de bien meilleures places pour profiter d'une bonne matin\u00e9e de brunch."
0,"I bought a Groupon for a facial at Canyon Falls.  Nice place....however, when I added Dermaplaning to my facial, I was charged $50.  I thought it sounded a little high, but went ahead because I was there and don't have a lot of extra time.  Come to find out the menu said that as an add-on it was $25.  I guess Groupons don't count as a real service?  When I brought up the overcharge on my review that they requested via email, I never even received a phone call.  So I will vote with my wallet; I will go back to my regular Med Spa Dermahealth.  Much less $ and when they do the Dermaplaning as part of a normal facial, I don't end up with scrape marks on my cheekbones!"
0,I am not sure why this place has such a high rating. The burrito (super burrito) carne Asada is no bigger than a Taco Bell $2 burrito. The carne Asada is very bland and dry. Don't waisted money on chips and salsa as they give you a cup and send you to the free salsa bar and your entree already comes with chips. ( wish they would have stated that earlier on) . The only reason for 2 stars is cleanliness and ordering time were both good and the salsa verde is in the top ten. I may try another location as I feel this one may not be to par with the original.
1,"So we came here for lunch. My friends have been here before. The decor here is gorgeous. The servers are excellent. They are all super friendly, helpful, and very attentive. We ordered a bunch of omelettes, sandwiches and salmon special. I, myself ordered a special omelette and it was delicious!!! Usually when I order omelettes at other restaurants, the ingredients inside do not fill up the whole thing, but every bite of my omelette here was filled with all the yummy goodness!!! The salmon was alright... a bit overcooked, but the sandwiches were deeeelicious as well! Overall, YUMMY!!! ^_^"
1,"Whether it's a breathtaking view of the city, a romantic sunset view, or a healthy hike, South Park Park is the place to be.  As a visitor from California, the landscaping here is just beautiful.  It's free and best of all, even if it's 100 degrees here, because of the low humidity, it feels like high 80s California weather!\n\nI highly recommend coming here for a visit either early in the morning for a healthy cool hike or for a spectacular sunset/city view in the evening.  Bring lots of water, a good pair of walking shoes, and sunblock.  I highly suggest a GPS and camera, too!  :)"
1,"My husband and I were craving macarons but didn't feel like going to sambalatte so what did we do? Look for places on yelp, duh lol. Manan bakery came up and their macarons looked pretty good compared to others so we hit the road. Once we got there I instantly started to drool! I mean their display case is just filled with tons of goodies! When I saw the macarons I started to feel suspicious about the place. Why? Because they look EXACTLY like the macarons at sambalatte! Bought 8 of them to see if they were the same and well to satisfy our cravings. We also needed a cake for Easter and they had some really cute ones. there were chocolate mousse cakes and chocolate caramel. Of course we got chocolate caramel for those who were wondering. Service was friendly don't have any complains there. Anyways back to the macarons...tell me why it is the same EXACT macarons from sambalatte!!!! Now I can't help but wonder who gets it from who! Either way I'd go to Manan since they sell it a couple cents cheaper. As for the chocolate caramel cake it wasn't too sweet but it was flavorful except for the caramel part. The Carmel had no flavor and was just straight icing which wasn't what I expected."
1,The Pad Thai was quite good and with a brownie sundae with spiced chocolate to finish I left in a good coma!  Service was very good and the staff was friendly.
1,"Second time I've been here. Now I remember why. It's easy to say the beer is good, because almost all beer is good. However- the beer here is divine! I am a true fan of the Cross-Pollen Nation. It's a fantastic stout based beer. Lighter than an imperial, but with flavors of coffee and fig.\nSmoked salmon bubbles.... That is all. My date had the baked lobster and scallop cavatapi... Essentially very rich lobster mac and cheese. Fantastic!\nTyler, our server, rocks my socks. \nCheck it out. Going back to my date now!"
1,Great Thai and Chinese food. Friendly family staff. We were served by their very cool 11year old son. Kind of place you want to support. Food was excellent and very reasonable. Go for the curry-
1,"I am extremely surprised that this place doesn't have more great reviews. I love \""great\"" bbq.  I do not care for dried out, flavorless, under-smoked, fast food, or only so-so BBQ.  Dillon's Grand has the very best BBQ baby back pork ribs.  I love food, and they have, in all seriousness, THE BEST, baby back ribs I have ever tasted.  Slow-Smoked Baby Back Pork Rib Plate, is what you must order.  They have three locations in Phoenix.  I've been to the Dillons Grand which is a little out of Phoenix, but they have two other locations.  It is well worth the drive to which ever one is closest.  The onion rings are also killer!  You won't be disappointed.  I don't live in AZ, but this place sure makes me wish I did."
1,Definitely different for your average white boy.  Go for number 39
1,One of my favorite hotels In Vegas! Rooms are huge and the bathroom is also nice and big. Hate paying more for 2 beds but then again it is Vegas. Pool is pretty nice with lots of lounge chairs. I'll be back for sure
1,"Gus! The first thing I thought of, naturally, was the fat mouse in Cinderella. I knew things were going to go well after that. \n\nWe arrived to a beautiful and charming restaurant and were immediately seated. Our server switched flawlessly from French to English as they seem to do so well in this part of the world and as he listed the dishes, I knew we were in trouble. Give me all the things! Thankfully, Risa was able to pick some of the best items and order for us. Their salmon tartare was incredible. Perfectly fresh and gorgeous. We also enjoyed the octopus appetizer and though that's not typically my thing, it was savory, a little smoky and not at all chewy. And accompanying all of these are three hot salsas on the table. Apparently Dave makes them. His restaurant menu is littered with nods to the southwest (chipotle, serrano) and these three little delights were no exception. \n\nAt that point, I'd gotten into my second cocktail. Their margaritas, Dave assured me, were as good as any I'd get in Texas. I had my doubts but when that fierce concoction arrived, I had to raise the white flag. It was perfect. As good or better than any I had growing up near the border of Mexico. A good margarita in Montreal may be hard to find - but Dave's got it down. \n\nOur mains were the pork and the (giant) steak with seafood. We may have over-ordered but by god, we we managed to eat every last bit of those delectable dishes. Then the dessert came. Seriously, trying to kill me. Thank goodness I had on leggings-as-pants or else things would have been dicey in the old button region. Our desserts were a dense chocolate cake with creamy frosting, some kind of de-constructed caramel-y apple dessert (tarte tartine?) and a lemon tart. I'm not even a dessert person and I was elbow deep, fighting for bites. \n\nRestaurant Gus is adorable and perfect for friends, a date night or that evening when you just want a glass of wine and a good dessert. When you go here, high five Dave and the staff because they're awesome."
1,"Shout out to Ron that works out in the garden center,. He's got to be one of the nicest Home Depot employees.  always friendly and remembers not only who we are, but others as well.  He's a tremendous asset to our community.  Thanks Ron."
0,"The view is incredible! But if you're planning on a good meal to go along with the nice view,,,think again! This place was AWFUL!!!! From the bland salad and the horrible appetizers and the very -over priced dinner, it's just one disappointment to the next. If you just have to go here,,,get a drink, sit in the lounge and enjoy the music and the great view. DON'T Eat here you will be very disappointed!"
1,Cool place - nicely decorated - love the art work for sale (wish it wasn't so pricey) -great beer selection at good prices - bartender Jeremiah was great !
1,"Pleasantly surprised at this little gem.  I had the curry tofu and my partner had the orange tofu... we finally stepped outside our box. (I usually will order something like the moo goo gai pan at restaurants like this)\n\nWe are glad we stepped out of the box because it was excellent.  The orange tofu had an excellent glaze and still kept it's nice softness on the inside.  Same with the curry. The curry was nice and spicy, just like it's supposed to be and doesn't kill you with the spice.\n\nWe didn't have an issue with the rice like other reviewers did... not special, but not bad either.\n\nThe staff were real nice.\n\nThere was a steady flow of people moving in and out of the place, even at 1pm.\n\nIt was quick, easy, cheap and tasty.  Definitely worth it."
0,"I ordered a salad with chicken for lunch. When it came, it was hard to distinguish the tomatoes b/c they were so small and pale pink. Some of the lettuce was rotten. It took almost 30 minutes for our lunches to come out, and the place was not busy."
1,"They switch owners like toilet paper. Food Is great, decent prices, workers are friendly and good ambiance.. Sucks that they charge for the salsa and chips now.."
0,This place was terrible!!! They took over 15 minutes to get the food.. We ended up leaving after paying without the food because they weren't wearing gloves and kept touching lifting up their pants! I will never eat at this place ever again!!
0,"I tried the Berry Crepe, it was ok, nothing special. They charge me $1.50 for a cup of plain Tap water."
0,TERRIBLE!!! \n\nPlaced a order for One Combo & 2 Sandwiches... They only had one cook and we waited over 15 minutes... Ok we understand there busy... But that doesn't explain why ALL my freaking food was ice cold.. Did the chef forget to cook it or what? I got up and told the cashier.. When I told her all my food was cold she just stood there all puzzled not knowing what to do... \n\nThis time they took 25 minutes to remake the order even though we were the only ones in the restaurant! \n\nI told the cashier we have been here almost an hour and wanted my money back! She was hasnieat at first but I walked out the 5 minutes later with my money and charged $5 bucks for my 2 small drinks.. \n\n If your in a hurry to eat or don't feel like idiots you shouldn't eat here.
1,Nice selection of local micro brews. Service and atmosphere was good. Had the BBQ pizza and was very nice.
0,"My first experience with this place was on a friday afternoon for lunch. All my other friends had the lunch buffet and I ordered off the regular menu. My meal was a large portion and good value, but not even an hour after eating there I got very sick. Their chicken gave me food poisoning, I don't think I will be back soon, every time I drive by and see it I have bad memories."
0,"Our tickets were comp'd and we still walked out!\n\nI love Sinatra, but this show was jusy bad. First, our seats were obstructed and uncomfortable, behind a sound stage ... Very strange layout. \n\nSecond, I can play Sinatra music off my old 8-track and enjoy it more. Why no narrator, introducing what we were watching or better yet, a Sinatra impersonator - I mean, this is Vegas, right?  Last, from our view, the dancing wad not even in sync with each other. \n\nMr. Wynn, I have so much respect for you and your accomplishments, but this show is (in our opinion) just bad."
1,"What a fun spot! Came here on a Wed night out of the blue with the hubs & some friends. I have been wanting to stop in for quite a while, and I was glad to have the opportunity.\n\nWe were sat promptly, and water was on the table quickly. The menu was SO interesting to read, and immediately I found four or five items that sounded delicious. Being pregnant, I stuck with water, but the rest of the people at our table enjoyed some great beers of draft - they were happy with the selection.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Vegetable Chop salad & a side of the bacon cheddar biscuits. ( How could you NOT order something that fabulous?) Hubs ordered the Pork Osso Buco Confit (and yes, I did have to go to Beckett's website to get that name, no way I was remembering that on my own.) Two others at our table ordered the Cast Iron Chicken & Chicken Meatballs. \n\nBefore we knew it, our orders were at the table. They LOOKED delicious, and from the first bite we weren't disappointed. The pork my husband ordered was nothing short of incredible, and my salad was the perfect size & well proportioned (I hate when you are overloaded with too much lettuce and not enough veggies.) Our table mates devoured their meals - not giving us a bite, which was understandable.\n\nFor dessert we ordered a Peanut Butter Smores milkshake. Oh my richness-heavenly-milkshakeland. That milkshake definitely brings the boys to the yard. Oh, and it came with a chocolate covered strip of bacon. Are you kidding me? Awesome.\n\nCan't wait to go back!"
1,"I really liked this place! My boyfriend and I went on lunch as I have become addicted to boba. I've always loved tea but boba has become my new addiction. My boyfriend got the peanut butter banana smoothie with boba and I got the lychee black tea with boba.\n\nThe service was quick and they were friendly. I didn't realize that this place was in a mall so parking was kind of hectic. We walked in and found the store fairly quickly and ordered our boba. The placed seemed very busy compared to the rest of the mall! We waited for about 6 or 7 minutes before we got our drinks and started walking around the rest of the mall before heading back to our car.\n\nI like lychee and I like lychee flavored things but this drink was just too sweet for me. If you LOVE lychee, and I mean love it, then I would definitely order the lychee black tea. I wouldn't have minded it if it wasn't so sweet. I tried my boyfriend's and it was AMAZING. So good. I could drink gallons of it. I mean, it would take me a while but I would do it!\n\nI want to try a peach green tea next time or a smoothie but we will definitely be coming back! They were quick, the prices were good for how much you get, and they have a huge variety."
1,"If you're an electrician or a lover of high tension power lines, this is the place for you! Some people love to see Cacti, some people love the ocean, and some (very few) like power lines.\n\nOther than the massive towers running through the course this place is in fantastic shape and offers some excellent golf. I was visiting the area and wanted to play as many places as I could. The previous day I played The Boulders South which is probably the best desert golf I have come across. However, this place is great too. The layout is very challenging.\n\nWe started playing from the Whites (which were moved up, less than 5400 yards) for two elderly gentlemen. Many pars and a couple of birdies later I realized I wasn't even thinking about strategy. It was too short. So on the back 9, I played from the Black tees which puts the course just over 7000 yards - now this was proper golf!\n\nThe course is in great shape and must be played. The twilight rate is $61, which is a huge difference from over $100 which I think it not justified here because of the view. The clubhouse is being renovated so I didn't get to see that. \n\nIf you're in the Scottsdale area and don't want to drive too far, this is the place to go."
1,"Finally a burger joint that makes good on their promise of a Kobe burger. I loved the ordering process where you add what you want each step of the way. My burger came out perfectly done and with the exact toppings I asked for (unlike Lush) The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot. Service was friendly and not pretentious at all. To make things even better, they have an amazing selection of micro brews on tap. Goose Island's Matilda? Wow! Definitely going back here."
0,"HOLY CRAP is this place way overpriced!  We had some time to kill in Concord today while the rest of our group did another activity  and thought the kids would enjoy going to the new aquarium.  We paid over $90 for two adults and 3 kids.  To be fair, there is a discounted rate online if your plan ahead, but this was a spur of the moment decision.  \n\nLet me put this into perspective - our annual family pass at the NC Zoo cost $64 and covers the entire family for as many times as we'd like to visit. It also gives us free and reduced entry into other zoos and aquariums nationwide.  A similar annual pass at SEA LIFE would cost $285 for just this location.  Or $850 if we wanted to include other locations.  \n\nAfter the wait and expense, we were expecting something fabulous and were horribly disappointed.  Even the kids were bored after the first 15 minutes.  It really is a collection of large fish tanks with very little educational value. Out of curiosity i checked the website for upcoming special events to see if we were missing something, but there was nothing listed.  It took us less than 30 minutes to walk through and I can't say we learned anything new or interesting while we were there.\n\nTwo thumbs down from everyone in our group.  Save your money and visit one of the other 5-star kid venues in the area.  I'm really annoyed that we visited today and will definitely not recommend this to friends or family.  In fact, I might make it a point to warn people about this tourist trap.  If I could give this 0 stars, I would."
1,"Love, love, love, love, love Kobatl! Ron & Gina are awesome bartenders! Oh, and Drewbie too! And Arturo, and.... well, just about everyone. :-) Kobalt is not a wild crazy party place (most of the time) but it is one of my favorite places to sit down and have a great cocktail or martini. I rarely drink beer, but they have a decent selection of it, bottles only though, no tap. \n\nMy favorite thing about the bar, besides the friendly (and often hot) staff is the atmosphere. It's located in Park Central mall, right off the Osborn light rail stop, so super easy to get to and super safe to get home (don't risk a DUI! Take the train!) if you live near a light rail stop. There's also a bike rack out front, I love riding my bike down Central to Kobalt (maybe stopping at Hula's for a bight to eat first, but that's another review). Careful leaving your bike overnight if you get too drunk though... I've had a wheel, seat and eventually the entire bike stolen. BUT that was 3 incidents and I had left it there overnight many times. Helpful hint: if you're too drunk to ride, call Discount and ask for a minivan cab, they're the same price and they have room for your bike! Some cab drivers will take it in their trunk too, but not all (the Kobalt bartenders won't mind asking the cabbie when they call though). \n\nThe atmosphere is great because it has WINDOWS!!! A LOT of them. The exterior walls are all glass, ceiling is high/vaulted and glass too. So there is a very open, atrium feeling. Great place to day drink because you can enjoy the fact that there is daylight and you're not just sitting in some dank, dark, windowless cave. The vibe is definitely more upscale than many Phoenix gay bars, but without any air of pretention or snobbery. \n\nTheir Patio is great, possibly my favorite in PHX, definitely in the top 3. (Bunkhouse and Bar 1 being the other two) I don't smoke, but I love sitting out there when the weather is nice. A large portion of it is covered, so it's great on the few rainy evenings we get.\n\nAs far as entertainment goes... (which is something I wrote a lot about in another review) I think this is where Kobalt falls a little short. I hate saying that because I really don't want to say anything bad about the place, but there's not much to see or do but chat with the friendly bartenders if you're there by yourself. (Although Kobalt gets a decent crowd so the bartenders are usually pretty busy) They have some good-sized TVs, but they're usually on a TV station with the sound off and captions on, or they're playing a closed-circuit loop promoting the bar's events, or a slideshow of previous events and fun staff photos.  Sound system at Kobalt is good, and they usually play good music, so that's a plus. There's also a jukebox (which you can control remotely via iPhone or Android! Cool geek factor) But that's about it. They do some shows, I love it when I catch T.C. Taylor there! She is awesome! But I don't really think it's a regular thing, since they have no real stage or dressing area like The Rock or Ice Pics. I guess what I'm trying to say when it comes to entertainment at Kobalt is: Bring Friends. It's one of the best places to sit with a group of friends and chat and drink, but kind of boring if you're on your own. \n\nOh! I will say though, on the entertainment front... one of my FAVORITE places for Karaoke! They have Karaoke 2 nights a week (I think) The crowd is hit or miss, sometimes there's a ton of people and sometimes just a few, but the rotation usually goes pretty fast, so you get plenty of chances to sing. The bartenders usually sing too, Drewbie and Kela (I hope I spelled that right) are great! :-) They're sound system is perfect for Karaoke, they have some of the best mics in town, and everyone just seems to sound better there. Kind of like singing in the shower, but you can keep your clothes on. (Which is kind of a shame because some hot boys go there, and work there!)\n\nCrowd varies widely at Kobalt... young, old, gay, lesbian, etc. Really depends on the night. Friday happy hour is their biggest night and it is usually packed with very attractive guys! Fridays get really crowded, you'd think it was New Year's Eve or something! Other nights are just right, not too slow so you're sitting by yourself in an empty room, but not too crowded that you can't move. \n\nSo in conclusion (Finally! And thank you if you made it to the end of this) Kobalt is a great place to go with friends (or make new ones, I find most people that go there are receptive and friendly, except for the snotty 20-something's that think they're hot, but they only show up on Friday nights).\n\n:-)"
0,Horrible drive thru! I waited 10 mins after i paid before they told me the fryer was not on and they were unable to service me.
0,"I had lunch on Friday, July 8 2011. They changed the menu. Horrors of horrors.  The salad that was perfect , farmers , was a soggy mess with too much dressing.  The bread, which was perfect,is now a tasteless brown bread. They are re branding to health food, why? Why not french style. Perfect fresh food cooked well? The salad was filled with tiny grains of quoina, if you like to have a million tiny grains stuck in your teeth this is the salad for you. Also, raw green beans.....WTF?\nThe manager was nice but fox is on a downslide. Probably getting ready to go public. Too bad another chain with mediocre food."
1,Awesome selection.  You can find stuff that they stopped making after the Carter administration.  Super cheap too.
0,"I found this place on Yelp, so a group of co-workers and I decided to give it a try. Well...big mistake! It was empty when we got there, that should of been the first sign! We waited for a minute to be seated, no one came so we sat our selves, we waited 5 minutes for someone to help us.....no one came to our table. So I got up to ask the lady at the register to help us, she pointed at our table and nodded her head yes. Shortly after she came to our table, gave us menus and with a rude attitude she poured our waters, never said a word, turned around and went back to the counter. After looking over the menu for about 10 minutes because we had to, we were ready to order so we looked over to see if they would even acknowledge us...Nothing! There were 5 employees standing by the counter, not one bothered to help us....it's like we were not there. So we left. Never again will we set foot in this place, worst service ever!!!!!"
1,"For a while I had been trying to remember the name of the steakhouse I went to that had, by far, the most incredible steak I have ever tasted in my life. I was able to locate this steakhouse via Yelp and immediately recognized it.\n\nFirst of all, it's probably been about 3 years since I've eaten there, but that does not mean that any ounce of my being has forgotten about the delicious steak and everything else I consumed that very night. Now, I love a good steak. I order steaks the way they should be ordered, medium rare. And I am not usually a fan of having any type of crust or marinade on a steak because I love the real flavor of the meat. I am only saying this so that you know that this review comes from someone who actually loves steak.\n\nNow, if you are finding yourself in Vegas or are going there for whatever reason, and you are looking for a good steakhouse, you MUST go to this place. Sure, it will cost you a pretty penny, but to me it's worth it.\n\nAmbiance is good, steak is absolutely cooked to perfection, and all the side dishes are killer."
0,"This was my message to the manager..I wanted to message whomever and tell you that your food is excellent. The service on the other hand is not. I am not one to complain and I will make this brief. My boyfriend and I went to your establishment around 10 pm Saturday night. We were seated by the hostess table and sat there for quite a while. I looked, made eye contact, and smiled at a server but after watching her walk by us four times I realized she wasn't our server. While waiting to get her attention prior to ordering many other tables were sat. The server eventually came over and asked what we would like to order. This server was indeed the same girl that I attempting to get service from initially. She apologized and was happy to take our order. I ordered queso, a pollo burrito without pico and and a yinzarita. She promptly came back with the queso and informed me that it was going to be about 15 minutes to make my drink. She then asked if I wanted something else. I said no and that I would wait.  There were three females who also ordered yinzaritas. I know they were seated after us because I thought about asking to be moved to that table. We got our food and I still had not received my drink. The server did come over once more and tell me it would be a few more minutes. I had pretty much finished my food and I realized the girls at the other table were all sipping yinzaritas. After a few minutes the server came back again, said it would only be a few more minutes and I asked her to just cancel my order.  I mentioned the girls having their drinks to my boyfriend and he (being passive as always) said, yeah, I was hoping you didn't notice that. I didn't ask for a manager or complain to the server I just wanted out of the restaurant. That was the second time eating at Steel Cactus and we had issues with rude staff before. The manager was more than polite but it doesn't make up for a bad experience. We will not be coming back to your restaurant. I hope eventually, you get either new staff or retraining needs to be implemented. I will be telling my friends about my poor experience and the few people I've already told have then told me their bad experiences with your restaurant. Good luck, with your reputation because its going downhill fast."
0,"The only thing this place is good for is to get drunk off of margaritas. That way u won't be able to taste how horrible the food is, and won't notice how crappy the service is, unless they're not keeping the drinks coming. By the time they brought out our food, the lettuce in the fajita salad and southwestern salad was soggy. The Mexican rice was dry, and the kid's nachos were served with stale tortillas. The only thing that was good was the so called \""filet mignon\"" fajita meat and the white peach margarita. \nI noticed a private party in the back with about 3-5 dedicated servers; which would explain why our service was slow and nonexistent."
0,"Came here last month with my boyfriend for some sandwiches.  Such...a...disappointment.  As someone who frequents Mill Ave and all of its shops/restaurants/bars often, I often walk past In Season Deli and it's rarely even open.  I thought we had lucked out when we actually saw two people in there so we strolled in.\n\nWe asked for two turkey sandwiches with the works and he also asked for a side of pasta salad.  Now there was only one older woman making the sandwiches, but it literally took about 20 minutes to get our food.  There was literally a fly swirling around their display case of their pastas, puddings, etc.  The lights in the case were blinking the whole time, made it very unappealing.  \n\nNot sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but they didn't even have any of their tables or chairs pulled out for customers, (maybe there weren't any yet that day?) so one of the employees pulled them all out for us and turned the misters on which was enjoyable.\n\nThe sandwiches were nothing special.  Something you would expect to see in a 2nd grader's brown bag lunch.  Regular wheat bread, oscar meyer brand turkey, one piece of lettuce, soggy tomato, mayo, and mustard.  His pasta salad had a film on it from being old, he didn't touch it.  Their sign actually fell off the wall as we tossed our food, it was priceless.\n\nReally wouldn't be surprised if this place closes down."
1,"I love my workouts at planet fitness! The environment is great, no lunks! The equipment is well maintained as well."
1,this place is the best the big meaty beef ribs to dim sum was the best my family loved it the prices are cheap and good or you can take some to go. this is our stop for dinner not too far from the strip. and the staff is helpful and quiet .and the seating is booth and chairs and tables.
1,"I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants, but if you're going to go with one, this might as well be it."
1,"Everything a restaurant should be . . .\nFriendly service\nFresh food\nFast cook time, short wait\nEasy parking\nNo hold time waiting to place my order\nVery reasonable prices, maybe a little on the cheap side\n\nThe blah . . .\n$3 for a 2 liter bottle of Coke is a little steep, I get its convenient, but still a little high."
1,This is based solely on the Titanic exhibit. Very cool. Lots of actual artifacts from the ship and persona on the ship. Even a huge piece of the ship if the ship which they own for 10 years before it is moved.  Good history lesson and cool replicas of how the ship was that you can walk through including the grand stair case.
0,"I don't know why they're always so busy, the food was horrible! They make you pay on the way in and then you're stuck! Do not recommend!"
0,"Incredibly overrated and overpriced. Egos on wheels. Get over it, you're a food truck with mediocre undersized portions. Deluded hipsters."
1,In just one visit we were able to sample a wide variety of great Indian cuisine. The Chicken Tikka Masala is incredibly smooth. The Chicken Biryani is great for anyone who is not fond of spicier dishes. The Lamb Vindaloo is fantastic and the perfect amount of spice for the dish. For dessert we sampled the Gulab Jamun which is absolutely delightful. The service was excellent with plenty of beverage refill offers and check ins from the staff.
1,Food and service was outstanding. Very flavorful and presentation was exceptional. Unfortunately the front end folks had an attitude because of our appearance (dress). If you can get pass that every thing else is worth the trip.  Thumbs up to the food and service. Thumbs down to the arrogant stiffs  up front.
1,"6...6....6 dollar sandwiches????\nEarl doesn't mess around.  As much as I don't like writing reviews for chains, this one is an exception.   \n\nEarl of Sandwich has brought me back from the brink after getting the drunken hangover shakes.  Conveniently located on the floor of Planet Hollywood, EoS serves Quiznos type of sandwiches, only wayyyyy better.  He's good for pregaming before a 12 hour rager.  I've had two types of sandwiches here. \n\nThe Caprese is your standard mozzarella, tomato sandwich with balsamic reduction. The Hawaiian is also your standard chicken, ham, cheddar and BBQ sauce.  \n\nTheir broccoli soup is chunky good, and their cookie will give you diabetes.  Earl Earl mm mm good"
0,Ho hum Mediocre food mediocre service. Glad I had a coupon.
1,"Came for the fame, and it did not disappoint! (other than my wallet... oh god). \n\n$50+ and I think their price is going up every year!\n\nThis place is HUGE, I get lost at where I am sitting for the first few times getting food back to my table. Nice decoration, they design it into sections and each section gives you different atmosphere. Ambiance is a little darker than my liking. \n\nService is great, attentive and courteous. They would swap your drink even before you finish your previous glass. Nothing to complain and meets my expectation of a buffet this price range. \n\nFood quality definitely superb! With varieties from various parts of Asia, Europe, and America. Their cookware are all super expensive Le Crueset or Staub. Fresh seafood, and GET THEIR WARM KING CRAB LEG near the pizza section. From many posted pictures in yelp you can already tell they give you TONS. Desert is good, their gelato is okay not the best I've had, but I am very picky when it comes to desert. \n\nMy dilemma when eating here is that since I'm paying so much already, I feel like I intentionally skipping all of the food that seems cheaper to make and will fill you up (carbs), like fried rice, taco, bread, hotdog... etc. However, I know I'm also missing out quite a lot because they could taste wonderful. And seafood is... just seafood. They are fresh, and high quality, but other buffets for $10 or $20 cheaper will have the similar seafood as well. So its a struggle to decide what to pick up to eat if you only have one chance. Maybe they should raise the price a little more, but make it a one-day-pass sort-of deal. So you don't have to stuff yourself up so quickly and can have more time enjoying all of the dishes. \n\nOh they change their dishes every other hour or so, so sit for a little longer, you might find something new."
0,I decided to get gel on my toes. One lady told me a price and when I went to check out it costed $50 just for my toes. Imagine if I had time to get my fingers nail done. What a rip off.\nOops! Wrong location. Sorry meant for Tropicana and Arby Rd.
0,This place is a joke. There were a few girls dancing who looked like they were high on heroin or meth. The drinks were way too expensive!! I would rather give my money to the homeless then this so called gentlemens club. What a waste.
0,"I saw little flying bugs in the pastry cabinet! EW EW EW. On the pastry and flying!!! There was only one guy working so I wasn't too upset about how long the wait was. There were three people waiting for their drinks. But it gave me enough time to choose what I wanted. I ended up getting large passion fruit tea and it tasted like water. My stomach was kinda sick afterwards, not too sure if it was just me over thinking the bug thing or what. But this was my first and last time at this Starbucks. I'll stick to the actual stores."
1,"Gyros are awesome!  Owner is Greek American!!!  Not a fan of the waitress Nancy though- she is straight out of Ed Debevics. Insulted me for ordering a reubin and a pancake on the side.  Ask to NOT sit in her section.  Seriously, she's THAT bad.  A good indication of this is, when you ask her her name, she never gives you an honest answer.  She literally lies to your face so you won't complain to management about her.  I'm surprised she's still there!\n\nGood wait staff and highly recommended is Greg.  He's very attentive, kind and quick on his feet!  Just look for the big burly muscular Dude- that's Greg."
1,"A group of 10 of us came here for dinner during the week on a last-minute reservation.  They were very accommodating. Ambience in the dining room is nice but nothing special.\n\nAppetizers: We had crab, oysters and calamari at the table.  I didn't eat the first two (not my thing) but others said crab was good, not mind-blowing.  The calamari was fantastic, no chewiness and cocktail sauce was great.  \n\nMain course:  I had grilled halibut steak, which was absolutely kickass; cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and HUGE. I could barely eat half of it.  Others had parmesan halibut (she loved it) Mahi (he liked it very much) and steak (she loved it). \n\nSides:  Everything here shined.  Roasted corn was BOMB, green beans were perfect, and their signature mashed taters with crunchy topping were great.  Why I don't make my mashed potatoes with a crunchy topping I don't know. \n\nDessert:  we each had a few bites of their tres-leches-like cake (not sure what the actual name was) with a caramel sauce on top which I could've eaten two servings of.  We also tried their key lime pie, which was good, but not out-of-this-world or anything.\n\nOverall, very good experience and I would definitely go back!"
0,"There are a large amount of stores here on a number of levels, but it's difficult to find anything (see Stripburger).  There are information kiosks/maps, but they are horrible at telling you how to get anywhere (see Stripburger again).  While they generally tell you where you are, they aren't particularly good at telling you where the elevator/escalator/stairs are to get to the next level.\n\nSo: There's a food court at the top level, all the way at the end of the mall, but if you want to go to Stripburger, it's at the bottom on the same end of the mall, on the outside.  Everything else?  Just wander around.  You'll enjoy it more.  If you go looking you might have a tough time."
0,"Used to come here all the time in the past (few years ago) and the tong sandwich was always great.  However, came back over the Thanksgiving holiday this year to get my tong sandwich fix while back in town, and the meat was over cooked and dry.  May have just been an off night for Compies, but this meal was a 1 out of 5."
1,"Sure, you could hate on LGO for:\n-the difficulty of finding a parking spot (although people are always coming and going, wait 2 minutes and someone will vacate a spot or there is ALWAYS parking across the street)\n-the crowd or occasional snobby worker (more often than not, the people are friendly and I don't wait more than 5 min to order even though the line looks daunting)\n-the \""our dishes are good and we know it\"" high prices\nBUT, if we're basing the review of LGO on food & experience: 5 stars.  \n\nMy biggest complaint would be the vegetarian sandwich, but I lived and I learned and I don't order it anymore.  Looking for something veg?  The sweet potatoe sushi roll, vegetarian breakfast burrito, and the mother earth pizza (which can be made vegan and/or gluten free) are all great choices!  \n\nOther highlights: the commuter sandwich with turkey, the AMAZING pizza, and their splendid iced green tea (or anything else from the coffee bar).  \n\nBut finally, I dare you to taste a Tammie Coe pastry that doesn't blow your mind.  The best is the Ooey Gooey cupcake - don't be led astray by how good the red velvet looks, just get the Ooey Gooey, TRUST ME!  If you're feeling dangerous, the Old Fashioned (which looks like a hostess cupcake) is wonderful, as are the cookies and cakes.  If you're not a confection kind of person and you can resist the pastry shelves, move due south within the restaurant to the Gelato shop where the ice cream is equally as delicious as the rest of the food!"
0,I had eaten at the old Scottsdale location of Oreganos many times. In order to have a larger building the old town location moved a while back. I gave the new building a few chances. I just can't continue to go there. The place is now such a cave. You can tell they did as little as possible to get the place open. But that's not what really sealed the deal. I actually have stopped going to Oreganos all together since they changed their pasta supplier. The new pasta has a terrible consistency and is very gummy. I had been going to Oreganos for about 15 years but the changes that have been made recently have stopped me from going to all locations. It's sad that it used to be my favorite restaurant but when they seem to have traded quality for profit it's no\nlonger the place it used to be.
1,"Love,love,love this place! My husband is a huge Carna Asada Fries guy, and this place is perhaps the best we've tried.  They pack on the meat, and really hook you up. The best part is that they're open 24-7. We live in CA, so when we have late night flights into LV, we come straight here, knowing they're open, ready to serve us, even at 1am. LOVE IT! By the way, Speak spanish to the cashiers, and they'll love ya even more."
1,"Gluten-free pizza, boys and girls! And you'd never know the difference, other than the fact that it's more delicious than regular pizza. I'd categorize these pizzas as definitely gourmet, due to the high end ingredients and unique combinations. It's a small franchise and I hope it keeps growing, because it's the best pizza I've had in the city. \nThis is a jewel in the heart of the grittiest part of Saint-Henri, not far from other unassuming hotspots like Grumman 78. I say it's unassuming because many a night, you can go in (say, on a Sunday night) and have the place completely to yourself. It's airy, cozy and clean, lots of candles and a big, beautiful painting on the back wall that I'd love to own. \nWe have always been treated very well by the staff here, always felt comfortable and like we belonged."
1,great BBQ great service my fav is tri tip sandwich ribs also great and love the sauces!!!
0,What happened? New owner? New management? We remember coming here and talking to the owner while he deboned a fresh piece of salmon and talked about curing and making sushi. Now the owner looks like he just stepped off the golf course and flaunts a $20 tip to sushi chefs making sushi with below grade fish. The 'Panko' tofu was good. Tonight it was Gordon's from the freezer. The yellowtail will assuredly make us sick. We will miss you Sushi Room.
1,"Located in a kinda run down neighborhood, but worth it to stay in such a unique cool place. Everyone that works here is very friendly. Right after checking in and going up to our room, I noticed it smelled like stale smoke (even though this is a non-smoking hotel). They immediately switched our room, in fact they upgraded us to a much larger king room. Not bad at all for a free breakfast with a small but nice selection of meats, cheeses, and fresh fruit. The kind gentleman who works in the kitchen/tends to the breakfast buffet even went in the back and found us some water crackers for the Brie, upon request."
1,"I really like the food at this place. I go there all the time, but the service is poor. And I hate to say it but, while they will help you (after asking them for something 3 times before they do it), unless you're Asian, don't expect to be waited on promptly. \n\nTheir food is amazing and the Salt & Pepper Calamari is the BOMB!"
1,"If Raku had a location near my house, I would probably go everyday. I'm not kidding--Raku is THAT good. Normally, on trips to Vegas, we usually venture to restaurants on the strip, but after seeing the reviews for this place we knew we had to give it a shot. And boy, am I glad we did!\n\nWe started off with the house special tofu (both cold and hot)---probably the best dish out of all the plates. The texture of the tofu is out of this world--creamy, yet firm with great flavor! If my love for tofu wasn't already beyond the fence, this dish kicked it out of the world! A MUST. \n\nWe also ordered:\nfoie gras- super creamy, melts in your mouth\npork cheek-great smokey flavor\nasparagus- again great flavor\ngrilled duck--slightly gamey and chewy\nchicken breast with crispy skin-SO SO GOOD. not dry at all, full of flavor\n(small bite) chicken and egg-(This is similar to a don bowl, amazing taste and great portion size on top of the tapas)\nkobe steak-it's kobe beef! enough said. \npork ears-crunchy texture and great flavor\n\nOn top of our wonderful dining experience, we also saw Olympian Apollo Anton Ohno sitting behind us!! He was with an Iron Chef contestant and some other people. If Apollo and an Iron Chef contestant eats here, I think you're in good shape to experience a fantastic meal here. \n\nCan't wait to go back!"
0,I ordered a Subway Club with lettuce tomatoes and mayonnaise and I had to explain to the guy making the sandwich 3 times what I wanted on it. Then my sons ordered a meatball sub and the guy kept insisting on it being toasted even after we humbly declined. Finally they got the order right after after 10 minutes of explanation.  The manager did however give us a free upgrade to a combo meal because of the incompetence of his sandwich maker.

0,"I had a negative experience with this property company and \nthe owner.\n\nIt took a long time for them to fix problems.

0,"Well... This was our second, and LAST time at this place... We were looking for a place to have lunch at Luxor where we gambled and shopped today. It was about 2:20 pm on Sunday. This is a long Veterans day weekend. We were offered a Hangover brunch menu which was fine. We ordered the steak and eggs dish for me and a sandwich for my husband. I also ordered some coffee, which came in a PAPER cup...!!! This was supposed to be a place that is at least one step above McDonald's, right? I was stunned, because everything else was much fancier, like nice glasses for water, atmosphere and all.. I didn't want to sound difficult or anything, I just wanted a regular coffee cup, but when Iasked for it i was told they had them put away... ???!! I also had no spoons or other utensils on our table, and even after the paper coffee cup was brought noone thought of bringing me a spoon... Had to ask another waiter for it... And even when he finally brought the spoon it never crossed their mind to bring us forks and knives to eat with... Basically, we had to ask for every little thing to make us eat comfortably...The dish took about half an hour to get to our table, and of course, the steak was burnt... At that point we were just so hungry and tired of waiting, that all I wanted was to eat and get out of there..I am not even mentioning the fact that when my husband said he didn't eat pork the waitress didn't offer to substitute it with chicken or something, and ended up charging the same price for a meatless version of his dish.. Needless to say that on a 30 something dollar bill we gave only a $2 tip for the terrible service and food we got. I hope they read this and improve, otherwise they would lose all the customers- there are plenty of places around to eat in Vegas!"
0,"This place touts itself as a beer bar but the selection was substandard for any serious beer aficionado.  I opted instead for an Arnold Palmer.  My BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger was decent but the fries were off.  They tasted like they had been waiting around for awhile.  My buddy liked his thin crust pizza.  I doubt I'll return to this place.  In Champaign-Urbana, there are much better burgers (Farren's) and much better beer bars (Crane Alley, Seven Saints, Radio Maria).  Old Chicago just doesn't cut it."
1,"Emily and Team have assisted me in the purchase of two homes and currently manage my rental home.  They do a great job of communicating all aspects of the renting and purchasing homes. Paperwork and upkeep of two homes can get a bit overwhelming but Emily and her team take all the time you need to go over line by line of paperwork and her negotiating skills are like nothing I have seen before! Emily goes out of her way to show every house that you are interested in and sends emails and her correspondence and follow up is always timely.  I love working with Emily and the The Duarte Group because no matter how many clients they might be working with they always make you feel like you are their number one priority. I would highly recommend The Duarte Group for your residential sales and property management needs because I have never had anything fall through the cracks. They are reliable, efficient and some of the most professional people I have ever worked with!"
1,Great place and beautiful patio!  Adovo Chicken Pasta and Poblano Chicken Chowder are favorites!
0,"The only reason we chose to eat here was because my parents and I stayed at the Mirage and this is the closest buffet.... but there's almost no reason for me to come back =(\n\n- mediocre decor and hype\n- stained containers and cutlery\n- ridiculously salty crab legs\n- poor selection of dessert that didn't look good to me, if u are a  dessert person, go elsewhere!!\n- food from different parts of the world were served in different sessions, but they were very spread out, and it almost took me a minute to walk from the Italian session to the Japanese session! \n\n+ the only plus was that their prime rib was actually pretty good.\n\nI didn't expect a lot, but for $25.95, I guess I expected it to be okay. Still, I was disappointed. We went to Paris for their lunch buffet the day after, and I felt way happier and more satisfied for just $17.99!!"
1,"I love this place for their many rotating taps, because they almost always have at least one Sour on the menu, and the service is usually very good.  However, their food leaves a little to be desired."
1,Asked around for a unique dessert in Montr\u00e8al and was told about the mille fuille at Chez Delmo. It was amazing along with their chocolate hazelnut torte! Had a bellini too. Our bartender was really great to talk to. Will go again when I'm back in Canada.
1,"The food was good! Corned beef was a tad salty, but the Santa fe burrito was awesome. The service was egg-cellent. If you can be seated in Louann's section do it! She was great and tipped us off on the groupon deal. We'll definitely be back!"
1,"Very good hot dogs. These beauties are charcoal grilled so they have that authentic family picnic taste. I ordered a footlong chili cheese dog with the bun grilled and an order of onion rings. The hot dogs were great and the onion rings were dynamite. Everything is made in front of you, so no soggy dogs here! Whenever I'm back in this area, I'll be coming to Ted's."
0,"Poor service, long check-in process and time...total hassle. Will never, ever rent from them again."
0,"This is to inform all patrons of Arcadia Tavern of a situation that has occurred to me while recently visiting on 12/28/2014.  I had just finished watching the Cardinals play when I noticed this Bartender of whom I seen work at another establishment some years back. I asked him if he had worked there , and he immediately looked up a me and rudely insulted me with an ephitet that is completely discriminatory and \nunexceptable for this time and day for any type of business. \n\nThe situation became so threatening,  that this employee seemed to reach for a weapon and asked to call 911. I was then asked to leave the premises because they had called the Phoenix Police.  I immediately respected the situation and left Arcadia Tavern.  I decided to call the next day and talk to management about the situation that occurred between this bartender and myself, and they just hung up the phone on me several times.  it then took a few more attempts to get management to talk to me.  Well, after finally talking to one of the management there, I was told that I was not allowed at Arcadia Tavern any longer and that a trespassing charge was filed against me.\n\nSo, my fellow patrons what I'm informing you here of is to be very cautious of visiting and spending your hard earned money at the Arcadia Tavern. This business really don't care about there long time customers. Please be very  weary of the management here ,and the staff they have in their employ.  This business is extremely wrong and extremely unprofessional that it would be a shame for this to happen to anybody else.\n\nTherefore, please be careful visiting the Arcadia Tavern in the future, it's not a good place and it definitely not a community restaurant to spend your money and time with family and friends.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTD"
1,Best donuts anywhere. Krispy Kreme has nothing on this place.
1,"Be careful....you get charged an entertainment fee in addition to tax with each drink...???\n\nPlace is fun, piano players are funny & have a great attitude. Place is very loud & seating is limited. Get ready to pay if your not a local $5.00 per person & I heard if you want to sit down at a table its a $10.00 charge. Not sure if that's per person. \n \nNo chairs @ the bar or tables around the inside bar area so if you don't get a table prepare to stand while you are there. \nNot a good place to go on a first date since its so hard to hear yourself or others when talking. \nOverall the place is fun!"
1,"One word: \""rich!\"" The fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken is fabulous!! Just freaking amazing and so rich just like the tiramasu oh em gee I think it's the best one I had. Literally writing this review as I'm eating it at home. They also included a salad and bread roll to the ginormous portion of the pasta. They also had a wide selection of drinks that they deliver which was great!! Big portions for a great price for awesome rich good tasting n filling food!!!!"

0,"My wireless router died last night, so I needed a new one. Went to the Staples on Green Valley because it's located the closest to my house. I walk through the door and say \""good morning\"" to the two 20-something employees glued to their phones busily texting (probably texting each other). Not even a peep out of either one of them.....never took their eyes away from their phones. Well, I'm used to those idorks behaving like that, so I just keep walking.  \n\n  I go over to the computer section believing that is where the routers should be. Nothing.  I start aimlessly wondering around the store in a futile attempt to find what I'm looking for.  Again, nothing.  I actually considered trying to talk to the text twins, but decided against it.  \n\n  As I start walking towards the front door.....lo and behold, what do I see? Behind the so-called \""tech desk\"", I see routers!  Unfortunately, there are only three of them, and two of them are the same model. None of them are the model I had in mind.  Why didn't I ask the employee behind the desk are those were all they had in stock?  He was on his cell phone!!!\n\n  I left that place with a promise to myself never to go there again.  I ultimately went to the Staples on Lake Mead. I've been to that one before with good results. Good news! That one had the router I wanted and now I'm writing this review! Isn't technology great???"
0,"I wish I could comment on the quality of food, but the first 10 minutes were so horrible I couldn't even stay long enough to eat. \n\nWalked in with a group of five, including two children under 10, and immediately was overwhelmed by how absolutely loud it was inside. There were multiple TVs blaring and no one to greet us, but rather a bartender who screamed from over the bar to pick a seat. We chose patio seating outside in hopes of actually being able to hear each other speak.\n\nWe get outside and our waiter takes our drink orders. Before we could even order for the kids, he said that they couldn't have their juice drinks on the patio. Weird, but okay, fine. We asked if we could set them down by our bags and the waiter, without any remorse, said no-- we had to throw them away or put them in the car. Already off to a bad start and we didn't really care to stay for more, so we gladly left. \n\nSure, if I were to bring in a Starbucks coffee and sit down at the restaurant, I would understand, but these were KIDS with gatorades. Typically, the argument against bringing outside beverages in to a restaurant is that the restaurant wants you to purchase a beverage from them, but we weren't even given a chance to order drinks for them (which we had planned on) because of how abrupt the waiter was. And then not to even let us set them aside? Ridiculous. \n\nRules are rules, but be courteous and friendly while delivering them, and maybe make sure everyone has ordered before you start barking them out."
0,"It was one of the first nice weekends in Montreal and we had heard that there were some nice rooftop restaurants open for brunch.  We arrived and sat down and were quickly surprised to find that they were not offering brunch, only lunch.  The sign in the elevator said brunch was offered from 11 to 3:30 but that was apparently just for the restaurant downstairs.  I'm honestly not sure if that's true.  We decided to eat anyway because we were starving.\n\nWe got some drinks and ordered an appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent, but that was the only positive point of the meal other than the weather and the view.  I ordered a veggie burger and it tasted / looked like a cheap patty that came out of a frozen package.  \n\nAfter we ate we then proceeded to wait for what must have been at least a half hour before our bills came.  The place was filling up and our waiter looked busy but unfortunately we were tucked away in a corner that was essentially forgotten about.  The waiter was apologetic when he finally did return which was appreciated.  Overall I would definitely not return as the food was below average and the service was pretty poor."
0,Worst. Restaurant. Ever.\n\nMoldy food (rolls should never be green. How do you not notice that before/while bringing out food?). Atrocious service. Then they have the audacity to charge for it.\n\nThis being Vegas let's make odds on what will happen first: the health departmet shuts them down OR the incompetent management bankrupts them. This place only survives on sucker tourists.
1,Took my Punjabi friend there for the buffet lunch and we really enjoyed it!  Will be back again & again!
1,"Love Love Love this place!!! There is nothing like it in Vegas.  Their panini sandwiches are so fresh and are huge.  A great deal for the price. They have a variety to choose from, you can't go wrong with any option but I always order  a side of jalapenos. Their smoothies and salads are excellent as well. I can never pass up one of their strawberry oatmeal smoothies; a perfect option for breakfast."
0,"C.A.S.A. how I have tried to like you. I would say I've been there 30+ times and certainly more than that if you consider it's previous life as Chronic Taco (same owner, same problems). For the purpose of this review I will stick to the outside bar since that is where I have spent of the majority of my time. \n\nI will start out with the one positive that the food here is fairly decent for inexpensive bar food. They have a creative twist on several entrees that make it worth the occasional stop in. \n\nLocation-wise the sun makes it difficult to enjoy this place year around and it can be down right blinding during sunset. Location isn't what really kills this place though. It is the lack of any operational savvy by the management team and disengaged owner. I certainly see Scotty there fairly often but he never seems very interested in anyone other then his friends. I often joke when I get dragged here that they will certainly mess up my drink run out of a key ingredient (like soda water) or just in general make a mistake. However, it's not even the mistakes that kill this place for me. It's the horribly rude bartenders and managers. It's so bad it's almost funny. They give me someone else's credit card back and glare at me like it's my fault ? Ok C.A.S.A. . I've tried. I hope you are successful, but I just can't come here anymore."
1,"came here with the hubby for the first time, for our date night,had a great time...and the steaks was delicious!...staffs was friendly and helpful. overall the place is beautiful. :)) hubby and I really enjoyed the foods."
0,"Food wasn't anything to rave over. Service was kinda horrible. I had the spicy tilapia tacos and the went overboard with the sriracha. My girlfriend had the chicken and black bean eggroll, let's just say it should of been called black bean eggroll.  Not sure if I'll be back here. I really had high hopes for this place."
1,"This is the BEST place to get your CROSSFIT on!! I am 33 years old, with a desk job for the last 3 years.  I needed the right place, people and knowledge to get me back in shape for the long haul.  The instructors are caring, knowledgeable, and so much FUN!  I was hooked the first week, lost a few pounds and gained muscle in places that I would have never done with an ordinary gym.  Every day is a new experience, new challenge, and new goals that are set as my body changes for the better.  Joseph and Chris are on point with the work outs they choose and push your limits in a positive way.  I am TRULY grateful I found this place!!!  I will keep you posted on 90 day goal to do one(1) pull-up with NO support."
0,"The food deserves 4 stars, but experience deserves 1 star. We went because I had living social deal and won't go back. We went on a Friday night at 7 and was glad that there was an open table. We had the pita & hummus and split the rocky point burger, both were delicious. I gave them 2 stars because of the atmosphere. I understand it's a sports bar and can be loud, but one of the servers was in on her day off I'm assuming and brought your small child in..fine...but we could have done without the yelling and high pitched screaming/baby talk. They acted like no one else was there and several tables seemed annoyed with it. It definitely ruined our experience and am surprised management allowed it to go on as long as it did. At one point they were so loud, all of the tables looked over. I would think you would behave a little more maturely at your place of employment but guess I'm wrong. We had to listen to it the ENTIRE meal. Even thinking about it now is making me angry, real mature!"
1,"its more than a casino and hotel. they have shops and restaurants inside, and club pure. serendipity is conveniently located right outside the building, so you can go downstairs and get some frozen hot chocolate!\nthe hotel is really nice inside; very spacious and classy looking. they have very comfortable mattresses and pillows so its easy to fall asleep and not miss home! pool area looks pretty too."
0,"I don't understand the 4-stars folks.  Yes, the outside is pretty, yes, FLW did a great job on the design.  But you can come for lunch and see all that.  There's no reason to actually stay here.  The rooms are completely falling apart.  I had to move from my first one because the a/c sounded like a jack hammer AND the toilet didn't work.   The second one's carpet was soaking wet and the toilet worked...sometimes.  But after waiting an HOUR for the bellman to bring my key for the first move (when they originally said 10-15 minutes) I just sucked it up and stayed in the second broken room so I wouldn't be late for my meeting.\n\nSome of the food is pretty good and there are some creative options (the Ranch Stack at breakfast, the duck-fat poached fries at lunch).  But the service varied widely.  At Frank & Albert's, I had a bartender make me a to-go order who was so friendly and helpful.  The next day at brunch the waiter totally forgot about me and I couldn't get a refill and eventually had to ask someone else to bring me my check.  Plus, the room service took forever. \n\nI also had a few spa treatments.  The massage was so good that I sought out a comment card to let her manager know.  I believe her name was Katie.  The facial was very mediocre and only lasted 38 minutes  (rather than 50 as advertised).  I wouldn't say my skin was in great condition afterward.  And the facialist was also trying to sell me some cleansing brush and products.  Not my favorite relaxing experience.  \n\nOverall, 2 stars for being pretty, the good massage, and because customer service wasn't consistently terrible.  But  I don't think I'll return next time I'm in Phoenix."
0,"I inadvertently crossed paths with one of the managers at Image 2000 and when the brand name Xerox was mentioned (which Image 2000 does not sell), he became incredibly rude and defensive.  It was amusing to watch a 50-something man start acting like an insecure little junior high school girl who was just told that her rival asked her boyfriend out.  He became so irate at the mention of the name Xerox that it was obvious that he's lost a lot of business to them.  His demeanor alone would certainly drive me away."
0,"6 MONTHS AGO I brought my chow girl in for a lion cut here and the groomer did a beautiful job on her and had her done in 4 hours.\n\nTHIS MORNING at 8am I took my same chow girl in and requested a \""lion cut\"" which she has had at least 6 times before not only from here but also other groomers. Today she came out looking like a giant chihuahua with cut marks all over her body especially all around her neck from being shaved too close. When I picked her up I was very disappointed in what they did however I did not notice all the cut marks until we got home, they had tied a rag (torn piece of material) that was supposed to be a bow around her neck...probably because they were trying to hide the cuts around her neck.\n\nThis place is horrible and the groomers are unprofessional. Previously they accepted credit cards and checks now they only accept cash. They had my dog from 8am in the morning til 4pm at night. By far the worst haircut ever.\n\nI called to tell them about the how dissatisfied I was and I was told she was too matted and it was more humane for them to shave her close...how is it humane to cut up the animal all over her body with a shaver? I stated that they did not even leave any fur but a few strands on her tail...you cannot tell me that was too matted as well, her response \""we will put this on your card for next time around to leave more fur.\"" Manager could have cared less, she continued to say the same lines over and over as if she has said them before.\n\nIt's a shady place, do not trust them with your animal, I am sorry I did."
1,"Everything on the lunch buffet was great. The dosa (Indian crepes that are stuffed) are VERY delicious! A person can get full on nothing but the vegetarian options,  there are plenty of meat dishes too.  Leave room for desert. Very friendly staff.  Parking near the capital is a little hit or miss but that is how it is everywhere downtown."
1,"It's like \""they\"" say, it's all in who you know. Well, I knew someone. \n\nAfter bypassing at least 150+ people waiting in line, we waltzed through the red velvet-like walled hallway and were greeted by a gorgeous view of a waterfall.  The club itself is in the shape of a horseshoe, with a couple of bars on either side surrounding the pool and waterfall.  There are plenty of comfy couches for table service which I'd imagine would be the way to go in here if you were with a group. \n\nAnd don't forget to check out the stripper pole on the right of the club."
1,"Hands down the most amazing vet one could ask for. Every time I bring my bunny in they always ask to come pet her, and finish her appointment on time or ahead of schedule. \n\nWhen I brought River in to have her fixed, they called the next day to follow-up and check on her, and then returned my calls promptly or put me through to a vet immediately to answer some medication questions that I had. \n\nI am so impressed with their care, as well as their follow-up. I would highly recommend them."
1,"What can I say but WoW!\nMy wife recently read about this place in the paper. \nIf you did not know it was there you would probably never find this place. It is situated off 51 ave. just north of Thunderbird.There is a strip of stores that run east and west and they are situated about half way down this strip of stores. \nWhen I walked through the door I knew immediately I would like this place. \nMy wife and I shared a pastry and a couple of short bread cookies. Don't ask the names we just picked what we thought would be a good selection for a first visit. OH! You get a piece of chocolate free on your first visit. \nI did not look at a menu but saw some of the specials posted on the walls. Now I am planning a trip soon to have breakfast. \nDecoration is for me hard to describe. Comfortable, friendly, clean, a place to meet a friend for breakfast or lunch, not just once but many times. There are two separate rooms where you can sit and eat plus outside. In the room we were in there was a wall with many different foods from England. \nEven though they were very busy the owner and one of the helpers took time to talk to us. \nEverything we had was very good. Or what I should say much better than good. \nGive them a try. I know you will be as impressed as I was."
1,"Very good service and very good food. The place is nicely decorated and the whole meal is affordable. The food is very tasty and very well cooked.\n\nAs a French, my only regret was on the chicken: although the sauce was very tasty, I believe that the quality of the meat was rather poor. But I guess it is complicated to find a good \""poulet fermier\"" (free range chicken) in the US ;-)"
1,"Highlights of our truly amazing meal at Scarpetta include some of the best handmade pasta dishes I have ever had. While the more complex agnolotti were delicious and certainly worth a repeat order, the best of all were the simplest: spaghetti with tomato and basil; pici with lobster. \n\nAppetizers and meat courses were also terrific, but secondary to the pasta. The one notable exception was a rib cap (cap of the rib eye), which I have never seen on a menu. It was tender, perfectly cooked, and literally bursting with a rich, fatty, beefy flavor. \n\nService was top notch, though we were in a private room with dedicated wait staff. The bar, though narrow, offered a fine selection of liquors with bartenders who know how to make a decent cocktail. For an aperetif, I strongly recommend the Aperol Spritz."
0,"OK..this review is for the sushi side only!  Remember that...we did not experience the hibachi side.\n\nTo sum it up, we'll never go to Hayashi for sushi again.   We ordered a sashimi plate and it was very good - couple of pieces I sure didn't recognize, but all four servings were very good.  Then to the rolls - salmon skin rolls were not.  Not even according to the menu.  Neither was the hamashi (sp?) roll.  Both were not good, not made the way they were described and the seaweed was tough.  So that brings us to the spider roll.  It was ok, but the tough seaweed kinda took the fun away.\n\nAnd the waitress was no help.  She admitted she didn't like fish and instead of taking care of replacement, she made 3-4 trips out to the sushi bar (if you go, don't sit in the back room) to get his side of the story.  Cream cheese in salmon skin roll...no sesame seeds on hamashi roll? What kind of fish was that?  Oh, red fish.  I understand. What's not to understand?\n\nI'm still praying for a great sushi bar on the west side."
1,We ordered a cake from Caketini for my sister's baby shower back in September and I'm still thinking about how tasty it  was! Definitely the best cake I've ever tasted. I live out of state and have been craving that cake for months now! The design was exactly what we wanted and the taste was even better. We chose a vanilla cake with vanilla custard....to die for. Everyone at the shower was ranting and raving about how delicious this cake was. I will be back during the holidays to get my Caketini fix!
0,"I typically do not write yelp reviews good or bad, however I relay on yelp reviews heavily  when deciding where to go and what to use. This is a perfect example of how accurate yelp actually is. It makes sense this company has such bad reviews. I arrived to the airport and was told by a man to go to the shuttle window that it was only $8 and would only take 20 minutes. Yes it is 8 dollars but now I am out nearly $200. The shuttle took 20 minutes to show up and 20 minutes to wait for all passengers to load and then 20 minutes to deal with my luggage THEY broke. The driver who was so rude came on the bus and escorted me to the back where he showed me he snagged my bag on another bag and apologized it ripped all the way to the handle. The manager came out they both apologized and said the claims department would fix it. The claims department after I contacted them said they were denying it on wear and tear, when i told them it was a new bag used 3 times they instantly said it was my fault for over packing. I have now asked for a supervisor to contact me and no one will call or email me back. My claim is simply denied and I'm left with a brand new broken bag and they are blaming me! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY SPEND A LITTLE MORE ON A TAXI. Also as a result of how slow they were I missed dinner with my friends. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with, with hands down the WORST costumer service. My next course of action will be the better business bureau and this company could seriously careless they are a disgrace."
1,"They got me at Red Velvet frozen yogurt! It's crazy good!!! The tart flavor was good but I got to admit I still like Pinkberry's better. \nThey also have Tammy Coe's goodies, but considering I'm trying to eat better, I have to work hard to ignore them and concentrate myself on the yogurt. Luckily, with flavors like Red Velvet, it's not too hard to do.\nThere are other frozen yogurt places near Zoyo. I like it much better than Golden Spoon, which lately have a very weird aftertaste on it sweet flavors. \n\nI met one of the owners and he was very nice!\n\nI would like to see other toppings like mochi and cheesecake bites. \n\nThey have a frequent costumer card that I'm sure I won't have trouble filling."
0,I am getting INCESSANT calls from this company. It's ridiculous.
0,"First off, they are nice people, Buuut, I was unimpressed, and it was expensive... The food, NO THANKS!  the pita meat was reheated,  tasted old, shredded lettuce out of a bag, old tomato, just not $9.00 worth of pita in my opinion, and that was just the pita, they wanted 2 bucks for fries, ahhhh, no. Save your coin and go somewhere else."
1,"Everything in Vegas is an imitation of something from somewhere else. Famous restaurants in NYC, LA, Chicago, Yountville, all open outposts in Vegas. So when I discovered a true Vegas restaurant that is one of a kind, it was like travelling back in time. \n\nMichael's is THAT kind of a restaurant. \n\nIt is truly unique and authentic Vegas experience, the traditional, classy, old school Vegas. When the mobs used to run the town. When public nudity was frowned upon. When a magical oasis sprung up in the middle of a dessert and drew people from all over in. \n\nDon't let the off-putting South Point Casino (and rodeo boys) deter you from visiting. The fact that it is in an unsuspecting corner of a kitschy casino - apparently they literally moved it from the old spot into this new spot - makes it even more fascinating. \n\nThe meal was enough to feed a village. My tip? Basically skip lunch for the sake of dinner. Trust me. Also allot at least 3 hours for dinner. After all the courses, it's essentially a French dining experience.  \n\nEveryone's meal started with a massive pickled plate of beets, carrots, cucumbers and assorted pickles. We ordered fresh stone crab appetizers on a decadent ice bowl, with a bib I could not refuse. The table-side Caeser salad was so involved it required two people. The dressing was maybe the best garlic to lemon ratio I've ever had. The Michael J's salad had avocados and similar ingredients, and was equally refreshing. \n\nIn the middle of our meal came a palate cleansing lemon sorbet with Dom Perignon with the perfect little bit of lemon rinds. Some other unique details of the service include the almost kitschy massive wine glasses with golden letters \""Michael's restaurant\"" on the side and the beer that was put on an ice bucket the way one would serve champagne. \n\nAs for entrees, the Chateaubriand for two just blew me away. The cut was unbelievably tender, and both bearnaise and hollandaise sauce decorated the plate. Asparagus, baked tomatoes, broccoli and carrots were perfectly pan-cooked, again with table-side service. \n\nAt this point I may have loosened the buttons on my pants. \n\nDue to time constraints, we had to skip the key lime pie (flown in fresh every day from Key West) and plethora of cheesecakes. In its place was a complimentary dessert plate of chocolate and white chocolate dipped strawberries, petite fours, chocolate covered kiwis, bananas and pineapples.\n\nThere is no doubt I will go back to Michael's every time I visit Vegas. It's a pilgrimage, no, a right of passage, an homage to the history of the city. And if you don't want to get too philosophical, it's really just a really superb meal."

0,Stains in the carpets. Fixtures falling off the wall and a big green line through the Freaken TV overall this place is a ratchet shithole. No wonder Paris Hilton sold this piece  of shit hotel before everything fell apart on her.
0,"I'm truly surprised that the reviews for this place are as high as they are.  I've been here a dozen times and I've never had a meal that was better than mediocre.  \n\nPros: The service has always been really friendly and attentive and our food has come out quickly and correctly without exception.\n\nCons: Everything tastes like it has been sitting under a hotlamp for several hours.  The food is--at best--bland and highly processed and the prevailing \""taste\"" is salt.\n\nIn short, it's the kind of place you would either go with your kids on a Saturday morning or go to try to gorge away a hangover."
1,"I have seen this place grow over the years.  Great place.  People who work here are not only knowledgeable, but actually care about the product.\n\nThis is an old milk distro center.  Misters if you sit outside.  Bonus."
0,"Overrated. Guys, don't wear tanks to this buffet cause they won't let you in they'll make you buy a $12 shirt unless you are staying at the wynn and can go to your room to change. Food was not that great and service was even worse.  The lady that was supposed to serve us got our drinks once and never came back to check for refills we had to get other waiters to get us more drinks.  We wanted to try this buffet going off the ratings and reviews on here and also spent more at this buffet than any other but were very disappointed with it. Studio B at M Resort and Wicked Spoon at Cosmo way way way better food and service."
1,Check out their outside grill.   They have great sandwiches; the cook is always friendly and helpful.   Great place for a good grilled sandwich; their ribeye steak sandwich is great.    Cannot miss having a quick lunch at AJ's.    .
0,"Bad service starting from the check-in desk.  They make you wait even though there were clerks standing not helping anyone.  When finally decided to call the next in line, they have such bad attitude and just don't want to spend one extra second with you.  The insulation is terrible in the room.  Being a time share, there were lots of kids staying there.  We could hear kids running all over on the floor above us and the screaming from next door.  The only pleasant person was the time share sales guy.  Thanks to the warning from others, we didn't take the bait. Even if you have to pay more, it's worth it stay away from this place!"
0,"I was out and about on a Saturday night at 8pm and decided to give Vintner Grill one last chance.  It was really sad\n\n1. This place used to be packed and without reservations you couldn't get in.  Prime time Saturday evening and if was a quarter full I would be surprised.\n\n2. The vibe was bad and the employees seemed... well... beaten down.  I'm not sure what's up but unhappy employees make for a poor experience.  My guess is a change of management is in order.\n\n3. The ever present smell of old fish still permeates the air.  Even if the the ventilation system int he kitchen needs improvement... fresh fish doesn't smell that way when cooked.\n\n4.  I ate at the bar and actually had prompt and pleasant service by the only bartender - Char.  She was the saving grace of the evening.\n\n5.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer which I felt was risky based on the old fish smell.  It actually wasn't half bad but then I was into my 2nd martini when it arrived and pretty hungry.  I little too dark on the outside but didn't taste burnt but tasty.\n\nThis is my 2nd not so great review and the last review the manager wrote me privately and asked me to give them a 2nd chance.  My response was \""why should I?\""  but I did it anyway.  I'm sad to say if it hadn't been for Char, the whole experience would have been worse.\n\nIt's a shame such a beautiful restaurant with abundant outdoor seating that's both comfortable and lovely is clearly mismanaged and well past it's prime.  I think they are going to have to work pretty hard to pull themselves out of what seems to be disfavor and probably need to hire a restaurant consultant to get some objectivity and change staff, etc.    Perhaps Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares can help eradicate the horrible odor and fix what ails Vintner Grill."
1,"I had just turned 21, so I don't recall entirely what was going on. \nBut I had quite a wonderful time.\n\nThere's a nice inside area with dancing/dj etc\nand a chill outside area where you can get fresh air by the pool.\n\nHighly recommend it!"
1,"My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference."
0,"I m writing this review for the gilbert rd/ baseline location but it seems the complaints are similar from location to location\nTheir food is good but god help you if you go there when its busy like we did on friday night 10/16/14\nYou don't get a single second to decide what you want before they sling it in your aluminum dish. Then they slide 4-5 of the same looking burrito under the cooker with no ID to the customer. GUESS WHAT?? You get the wrong burrito and they throw your food around like its a jailhouse mess hall. I watched a female employee throw a cup of guac at the cashier who did not catch it.\nIts cafeteria style and when its busy.....its a freaking zoo\n\nSo.... You get the wrong burrito and pay more at the register.  Watch out for extra anything because you'll pay for it.\nEven though we had a free burrito coupon....it was a nuthouse and the employees are slinging so fast that you simply dont have time to decide anything.\nSo you get what you get and with 30 people single file in a long line...who's gonna listen to you??\n\nHey Cafe Rio- time to rethink your assembly line process and instead of upchargng for grilled steak and chicken, just have them be priced as separate burritos on your menu. Grilled meat is a mexican standard??? No???\n\nRight now....Chipolte is my go to burrito for price and service...sorry cafe rio."
0,"Monopoly. Yeah, I went there. Really, if you want high speed internet do you have an alternative? No. Cox knows this and charges appropriately. The service is for the most part reliable but as luck has it when it goes down it seems to do so at the worst times. \n\nI really wish there was an alternative to paying out the nose for cable and internet services. We mainly watch 2-3 channels and that seems to be Nick Jr. and the Disney Channel for my 2 year old, the phone line is mainly used by people looking for the previous person who had our number, and $70 a month for the internet portion that's fast but not fast enough just leaves us going Ugh! every month when we pay the bill. \n\nIf you call in you can get good service, but we've also had clueless technicians come out and mangle our wiring, and they called in and added things that mucked up our bill. It's like sometimes the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing over there, and the consumer is the one who ends up having to fix their mess. \n\n2 Stars: One for Internet speed, One for customer service reps who are nice."
0,"Great food but, very bad customer service.  The management was not helpful and didn't try to make us happy.  Management needs better training on servicing their customers."
0,Great service and tastes good.. But boyfriend and I got food poisoning after we got home...so not eating here again.
0,For Taiwanese style of breakfast.  The  seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone.  Disappointed!
0,"I'm sorry. On a few levels. Needed a breakfast place in the area yesterday and went with Yelp. This is the first time I've been disappointed. with Yelp consensus reviews. \n\nI love Jewish delis and have learned to \""settle\"" in Phoenix. \n\nBut I'll never settle for Eggs Benedict on a bagel with a slice of Kraft American Process Cheeselike Food Product between the deli ham and the poached egg.  Don't offer something if all you're going to do is mortally insult it's memory!\n\nThe coffee at least is the swill I grew up with B.S. [Before Starbucks} - just like I remember in Jewish delis and everywhere for that matter - but that's another rant altogether. \n\nMeh-be the lox is good. Meh-be the good corned beef is piled sky high. I'll probably never find out."
1,"Came a few days ago for a lease, wasn't sure of size needed, so I guessed, three times! Finally got it right, but hey, the store didn't bat a eye lash when I returned the ones that didn't work, they just asked if I needed help picking out a replacement. \n\nSince my cat has been loosing weight, I could not get the size down, so after my attempts, finally got the small dog size and sure enough it worked. Now to get the cat used to it before we need it. \n\nThis store has everything you could need. They is even a new section by Martha Stewart, everything for you little pet. But her stuffs pricey, a lease from here collection, $19.99, boy that's steep! \n\nThe store is clean, neatly kept, well organized and they have grooming services. The employees were friendly and helpful, they looked like they enjoyed their jobs, and I would make this a regular place."
0,Seriously the worst bar service in Madison.. I can't get over the fact how such a great place can't either get good help or isn't willing to hire a manager to teach their staff how to be attentive and a little more courteous.. The food is great.. If you're willing to spend two hours waiting for a drink and then asking the server three times if your table is ready..
0,"This store is right near our house, so I run in often.  It's pretty lacking in the features of a grocery store:\n\n- service is terrible - the cashiers are super slow, confused and sometimes disheveled.  \n- the self-checkout machines have an issue just about every time.  i use these everywhere i can, typically with great success....and the attendant is usually nowhere to be found.  When they finally arrive, they're confused and slow.  \n- the selection is paltry - they have pretty obvious things but don't expect many brand choices, options, etc.\n- the prices are a bit steep, compared to bigger, nicer stores, plus they don't seem to have a lot of sale items\n- the produce is pretty terrible.  the guy who works in that department will cheerfully help you pick a pineapple, though.\n\nIn summary, if you don't live just down the street, avoid this place."
0,"We were eager to try So-Cal, so last night was the night. Maybe we expected to much from a restaurant that says they \"" want to give you food that you can get stoked about\"". \n\nOk, it started out good. We got the Oysters on the half shell and some of the Mission Brewery Hefeweizen. The Oysters were fresh and very tasty. The beer, cold and refreshing.\n\nI ordered the mahi tacos, and my husband ordered the shrimp tacos. With each bite we kept saying to each other, is this it? We came here for this? We waited 30 minutes for this?  The tacos did not have much flavor. Tacos from Rubio's taste much better. The beans tasted as if they were out of a can, and whats with white rice with tacos? Is that what they do in So-Cal ?\n\nMaybe the cooks were a little to much in a \""California State Of Mind\"" last night, and forgot the seasonings on the fish."
0,"I really don't want to write this. This restaurant used to be on our regular rotation. That is why it is so disappointing that it has gone down hill. Yesterday I was there for the lunch buffet - which is the trademark of this place - and it about made me sick. The issue is the 'tongs' that are used to pick up your sushi from the buffet table - they are gross ! Now, I understand all buffets suffer from this issue to some extent but what was happening yesterday was a whole new level. With each new tray of sushi being brought out the staff simply took the tong from the old plate and put it on the new plate. Also - and this was the worst of it - they laid it on top of the new plate of sushi. \n\nNow, if this was one server and one plate - I wouldn't be writing this - but this was consistent throughout the 45 minutes I was there during the lunch hour. By the end the tongs were visibly filthy. I mean - sauces and rice and whatever being transferred from the old plate to the new and the servers just took it in stride. I mentioned this rather loudly to the other patrons at the buffet table and 2 others held up their tongs with a disgusting look on their face.\n\nIt was gross.....and unacceptable....."
1,"One of our best wedding anniversary dinners took place here at Hugo's Cellar.  I made sure to make a reservation over a month ahead of time because I really wanted to take my wife here for our special day.\n\nThey are located in downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street inside the Four Queens Hotel.  The ambiance was almost perfect for a romantic dinner evening.  Felt like we had traveled back in time because of the decor and atmosphere.  They greeted my wife with a single long stem rose which made my wife very happy.\n\nThe food was very good.  Their table side salad was excellent.  Our steaks were delicious.\n\nAll evening, the service provided to us by the staff was top notch.  Very classy.\n\nThanks for a wonderful and memorable anniversary dinner.  Hugo's Cellar is a fine establishment to take your special someone for that special occasion."
1,"Just got my neck and back done. Staff is awesome! Professional and friendly. Treatment is way simple and, to me, painless. If your like me, and have always wanted your neck permenatly cleaned, this is the spot for you!"
1,"Ok, We had to come back a 2nd time since the first time was excellent.\nand the 2nd time was just as yummy!\nI got the Pad Thai, it comes with shrimp AND chicken!  I was surprised it came with both but that's a bonus right?  The shrimp was cooked perfectly as was the chicken.  The chicken however is thigh meat which I wasn't prepared for, but it's still amazing pad thai. I didn't finish it so I'm now eating it for lunch 24 hours later...at my desk...cold.  Eating it cold brings out so many more flavors that I didn't experience when it was hot and fresh like the Thai basil, lime juice and cilantro.\nI'm a fan of Angelina's for sure.\nThe service was superb, I don't know who our server was, but he was cool and very attentive.  \nI have absolutely no complaints...except they need to fix the chairs so they slide on the carpet easier :)"
1,"After a night of clubbing at Tao, we made a pit stop here to satisfy our late night hunger. We got seated immediately and our seats were right by the entrance. I think my friend and I shared a bowl of BBQ Pork and Roast Duck Noodle Soup while the 6 of us shared Dim Sum (Har Gow and Siu Mai). Each Dim Sum came with 6 pieces each so it was perfect. They were very accommodating and the food was pretty good. When it came time to pay, my friend and I wanted to pay for the birthday girl's share. I wasn't provided a receipt after paying so I went to ask for one because the birthday girl kept asking (wondering why no one took her credit card). All in all, not bad for my first time here."
0,"I hate this place.  I have been here twice, and the portion sizes are pretty ridiculously tiny for anything that's not pasta, or bread, or french fries.  I got a generous serving of french fries with my chicken sandwich, but the sandwich itself was mostly bread and maybe a half a chicken breast pounded flat.  There was not much of the cheese sauce that was supposed to be on the sandwich, either.  Did it taste good?  Sure, when I managed to get a bite that actually had all the ingredients of the sandwich in it.  Also, the top piece of bread was hard, probably because it'd been under the warmer for a while.\n\nI feel like they charge high prices for mediocre food; I do like having a spendy meal every now and then, but Destihl is not where I would go when I do."
1,"Hungry after the 6 hour drive, we walked down to Rue Saint-denis for some poutine since it was near our hotel.  Waitress with friendly (this was our first restaurant experience in Montr\u00e9al).  I ordered the poutine with the caramelized onions and merguez sausage.  The bf ordered just the classic poutine.  To complete the meal we ordered a pitcher or Boreale.  I wanted the Boreale noir, but the waitress said they were out, so the lager it was.\n\nThe poutine was very tasty.  The curds were hot gooey, and the sausage added a nice savory element to mine.  Overall, we were both pleased.  The petite portions were still pretty large and satisfying, so we ended up skipping dinner that night after this late afternoon snack."
1,"It's like getting authentic street tacos, but in a nice clean restaurant with tables to eat on. There are so many choices of meat! But luckily the tacos are 2-biters (or 3 if you take small bites) so you can try a variety of different kinds. My favorite is the Adobado- or spicy pork. I feel like that one packed the most punch. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the carne asada fries and he wasn't too overly impressed. He didn't like that the cheese was cold and wasn't melted, so it wasn't as epic as he thought. But maybe the adobado fries would have been better with the spicy meat. We'll have to try that out next time :)"
0,"Atmosphere was good, but the hookah is the biggest rip off ever. One quick light coal, and it's overly expensive."
0,"I just finished filling out the request to put this place on \""Extreme Makeover: Grocery Store\""\n\nOutdated, and just plain depressing.\n\nThe happy: standard selection of regular grocery, decent liquor selection. They sell flowers. It's tied for closest store to downtown.\n\nThe sad: deli, bakery, produce all suck. The cashiers look like they are trapped in some sort of Roundy's prison."
0,"Beer's cold, problem is the 2 times I've been there so too has the service.  Sometimes you need a cheap Mexican food fix and this is the place for it.  This place is IN Mandalay Place..... I'd suggest spending the extra couple of bucks on food at Border Grill in Mandalay Bay for more upscale and flavorful Mexican cuisine."
0,Went to the bar for happy hour and our bartender was so rude...and so was everyone else...They acted as if we did not exist...They're lucky I left them three cents instead of the two I really should have given them...boo for them!
1,"Let me preface this review with a little history...\nI'm married to a chap from England. \nI've been to England. And I eat. A lot. Not too memorable, if you get my drift.\n\nHad I not seen a soon-to-be-opened Scottsdale location, I never would've tried this place. You know, British food and all (keep in mind my British husband who loves these things called mushy peas,  \""Bubble and Squeak\"" and some sort of kidney pie). Ewwww...nuff said.\n\nWell, out of curiosity, I looked up the menu, and off we were to the Tempe location. \n\nIt's VERY dark in here, and I imagine that on some cold, winter day, I'd like to spend a few hours in here drinking beer, listening to the awesome music they play and fiddling around with some of the menu items I haven't tried. And I know that when it's hot here, we all like to hide from the sun a little. But seriously, it's a little difficult to see the menu. And the food. \n\nOn my first visit, I had \""The Porky\"" which has pork, potatoes, apples, onion and sage. It's served with this delicious red wine gravy. I should've stopped after I asked the waitress for a to-go box, but I couldn't stop eating. It was wonderful. As in AWESOME.\n\nToday, I had the Lamb and Mint. It had lamb, rutabaga, onion and mint. Also, that wonderful red wine gravy. Killer good. \n\nAnd by now, you're probably aware that all of these delights are contained in this \""pocket\"" of dough, baked and neatly sliced in two when they serve it. \nIf you sit at the right-hand part of the bar, you can see the cooks prepare all of the food, and it's really quite an art. \n\nThe best thing is this: they have all different pasties for all different tastes...italian, mexican, vegetarian, greek and even an American Thanksgiving pasty with turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, stuffing and cranberry sauce. \n\nCheck out the menu and try this place. ! They have fabulous food, good music and lots of fun beers. \n\nGod save the Queen. And Cornish Pasties...."
0,"The employees are sweet and work as a team. But I would NOT recommend going there for ANY of your wedding needs! TRUST ME, she does NOT do business the way it's supposed to be done! You want to talk about getting down to CRUNCH time for your wedding, even if you planned ahead and placed your order wayyyyy in advance, you will NOT get your ordered items until a couple of weeks before your wedding! This lady bashes her employees, asks them to lie to customers about ship dates  *very disappointing*  Not to mention the poor money managing skills.. Who gives checks to their employees and asks them to wait AT LEAST a week to cash them?!?! Or who waits almost a month to give an employee a single check?! I had received 2 paychecks from my current employer before I got my first check from her! You ultimately make the decision of whether or not you want to go through this store, but trust someone who knows what that store is like and how it works behind the scenes. (None of her employees respect her, like her or agree with how she does things)"
0,"I requested an intimate table for two months in advance and we were seated at a four top near the casino floor despite there being far nicer tables open.  As we were so close to the casino floor we were bombarded by not only the sights and sounds of the casino, but the cigarette smoke as well. Then, one of the servers spilled water all over our table and never bothered to wipe it up, leaving our placemats and flatware in a puddle.  And they served our entrees less than 5 minutes after they served our appetizers which was not only unprofessional, but just downright rude.\n\nMy Husband's Toad in Hole was tasty, and they cooked his steak rare, just like he requested, but the British Ale and Onion Soup was just so-so, and my Shepherd's Pie lacked seasoning.  Seriously, just a bit of salt and pepper would have been nice.  You'd think lack of seasoning would not be an issue at a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant! The only saving grave was the delicious cocktails and the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  I'd say go for drinks and dessert, skip the dinner, especially for the price!  \n\nI've now been to all 3 of Ramsay's Vegas establishments and would recommend Steak and Burgr hands down above this one.  I'm surprised they hail it as Gordon's hang out when he's in Vegas, because we found it.. well.. disappointing."
0,Mediocre at best. They boil the crab legs to the point that they are mush. Overall it is your typical buffet experience...store bought cake desserts etc. On top of that the meal was way over-priced. $18 for frozen seafood. We will forgo future visits.
1,"The restaurant storefront with patio seating is on Church street.  But you can walk through the building at 400 S Tryon and find it.  When you see those funky white toadstool-pillar looking things just blast through the double doors like your wallet's on fire and keep going straight back.  \n\nGoing that way will take you into the \""to go\"" area which is the upstairs half of the restaurant.  But it's just another five feet to the main dining room for a sit down lunch if you have time.\n\nThe \""chicken salad\"" is a real grilled chicken breast  on a nice bed of greens.  It comes with a hard boiled egg, in case you needed more protein, and croutons.  They're very good about specializing your order with requests like \""no onions\"" and \""no cheese\"" which gets high marks from me. \n\nAnd they're just darn friendly here!  Everyone in the restaurant is relaxed.  I enjoy feeling like I'm not working for a few minutes while I enjoy a healthy lunch.  And when I'm in the mood for burgers and fries, they've got that too."
0,"I'd come here with a group of acquaintances from a convention across the street.  The majority of them had chosen Gardunos because they don't have many Mexican restaurants where they come from.  \n\nThe restaurant is a typical Mexican establishment, although I question its authenticity as a Mexican establishment when they list two versions of Fettuccini Alfredo in their chef's specials.  \n\nMy acquaintances ordered the tableside guacamole, which I've always found to be a rip-off in any restaurant, especially because it's not like a teppan show when they're mixing the ingredients up.  Sure enough, the guacamole mixer was rather uninspired, as were the ingredients she brought with her.\n\nI had the Stuffed Sopaipillas, mainly because I love sopaipillas.  You include sopaipillas in your menu, I will try them.  And they were... OK.  In the end, it might as well have been a burrito I'd had.\n\nMy friends may have thought they were someplace serving pretty good Mexican food.  Considering they made some banal choices (cheese enchiladas, chicken burrito, etc.), there was nothing to complain about save for the service from an over-worked waitress.    In the end, I'd had comparable food at some of the fast-food Mexican places in my area.  Better than Taco Bell, but not worth the effort for a sit-down place."
0,"I have been going to North for 10 years. It once was a cool,layed back place with great service and food. The bartenders knew their regulars and there were a lot. Sorry Sam Fox. No longer true. It is so hot in there and the service is awful.. I asked if I could sample 2 wines. I was given a dime size of wine each time. I settled on Conte Fini Pino Grigio. A safe no brainer. Bartender opened the bottle then sat it down at the bar gave us 2 empty glasses, then left. She didn't even pour 1 glass. And the wine was warm. The pizza of the day was cheese and sausage. I asked if I could get it with out sausage but with a little basil on top. No I was told. It would cost a dollar. Ok I said. The pizza was like cardboard with crust. It used to be great. What happened? It was crowded so I guess they don't care."
0,"I've been to Vegas more than 10 times and this time used a VIP host for my weekend.   I was so pumped about going to this place and the hype from other Yelpers was enourmous.\n\nThis place is a club with the \""regular pool\"" area added to the club at night.  If you like places with 5000 people then go here. \n\nIf you have been to clubs as many times as I then hit up a smaller place.  I felt like I was at Spring Break, not  high-end club in Vegas.\n\nI know people will kill me for saying it, but Tryst is way better.  Much better atmosphere and actually a chance to talk to people.\n\nXS is a Zoo, the Cabanas are on the second level overlooking the pool so you are not really in the action.  Ask for a table near dance floor if you want to see people.\n\nI've been to the French Riveria (Monaco) and Cannes - This place has no idea what French Riveria Clubs look like or feel like.\n\nThe DJ played the same song 2-3 times in a 3 hours span.  I walked in with Randy, Simon, and Ryan Seacrest... They even left after 1 hour.\n\nSave your time, money, energy, and hype - Go to Blush or Tryst and have a blast."
1,"I've been here several times, but most recently I went there with a girl friend who was visiting from Vegas.  We decided to stop in real quick and enjoy the happy hour specials.  The specials were fantastic, probably one of the best happy hours, but besides the pricing, the food and house margaritas were delicious.  The service was great (we had bartender Ben who was awesome).  We even met local Charlie who let us try one of his special flour tortilla chips that we were curious about;  which were great.  If you're an enchilada fan, I would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.  We found the combination to be great together.  The cheese crisp and fideo are always a favorite too.  I find the 'water park' as mentioned by another Yelper and the patio to give this restaurant it's charm.  If it wasn't summer, I'm sure we would have been out on the patio."
0,"Before even going through to the doctors, I would like to first say that the receptionists there are among the rudest and most obnoxious I have ever seen. When I called in, they don't know about what they're talking about: when absolutely there are certain free services for students, explicitly mentioned on the website, they said I have to pay. Then I quoted the website and they CUT ME OFF, \""Oh, you have to pay when *extra* treatment is done to you.\"" I didn't ask for the extra treatment at all and was just asking for a visit copay. Previously, they had already mischarged me and my insurance, which took me weeks to get the incorrect charge off. Read: They wasted HOURS of my time. Because of their incompetence and negligence. When I was there, seeing patients were in line, the receptionists were chatting among themselves, and would obnoxiously brush you off when you ask questions. Is that the service of a teaching school? Shame on Midwestern - the CVS service is much much better! Don't come here - you will waste your time - this is an honest review coming even from a student at the school."
0,"We arrived on Friday 5/10 the room we were given was on the 68th floor and we were excited to check it out. Upon arrival we noticed that this room had very filthy and worn out carpets. stains and spots everywhere. Well we didn't complain much initially as that was the only thing seems saw out of ordinary. On our second day of stay we went to the desert and we left early in the morning . Once we came back at 3:30 pm the housekeeping was not done yet. We wanted to take bath and we had no clean towels. we called the front desk and complained they brought some towels and apologized. On the 3rd day I found a very dirty and soiled towel in the bathroom folded as a clean towel. It was really nasty and I have taken pictures of it. I called the front desk again and reported the issue. On my last day of stay which was Sunday I was told I could get into the Marquee pool for free since i was a hotel guest. At the door the bouncer wanted $20 to let me in. I went to the boulevard pool and my God was this pool not filthy! All type of objects were floating in the water and there was a way too much chlorine in the water that I could not even breath. Well this tells me that the water rarely gets replaced and in order to keep it from molding, they have to add a huge amount of chlorine to it. As a final surprise the housekeeper walked in on us as we were packing for our check out. While I had told the front desk exactly when I would check out, this is not communicated to the housekeepers.\nIt felt like we had a 2 star hotel room but paid a 5 star price for it. This  was my worst Vegas experience and will not be back to Cosmopolitan again."
1,Is the $24 hamburger worth it?\n\nYes. Yes it is.
1,"Do you wear light flannel in the summer and listen to Decembrists? This place is for you! \n\nBut really, if you're looking for atmosphere maybe you'll go to Michelangelo's. But if you want straight up well made coffee and vegetarian breakfasts, this is the place."
0,"The food is pretty good, if you actually get what you ordered. I only get take out and as much as I try to check something is usually wrong when I get home. Ordered chips and salsa and only got chips covered in cilantro? I don't get it. The guacamole was a neon green and I decided to steer clear of that. Horchata is watery. I prefer Roberto's and will drive the extra distance next time."

I have been going to it for about a year, but I'm changing my prescriptions over to another Walmart because I just can't take the trashiness anymore. \n\nI love Walmarts overall, but this one is the reason that I can't always recommend them to friends.

0,"I came here on my lunch break at work, because it is right up the road.  They have an ecelectic menu for lunch, with a lot of gyros.  I decided on the fish gyro and called it in.  It was ready within seven minutes or so, not bad at all.  A couple of my coworkers and I came to the store together to pick it up.  The line was almost out the door, it seems really popular for people who work around here.  Honestly though I think it is just because there aren't many other choices around here.  \n\nWhen we got up to the counter a waitress asked the cashier, \""Did they give you a tip?\""  We thought she was joking so we laughed.  \""Seriously,\"" she replied.  Wow, how rude!  Not to mention my fish gyro was dry and I had to load it up with tartar sauce, thank god I was really hungry."
0,"On our last night in Vegas, we decided to have one last meal.  On our way back to our hotel (Excalibur) we passed through the NYNY.  Did a search on the restaurants in NYNY and found that America was the only non bar open at that time (1 am).  Menu looked decent, certainly appeared to be better than McDonalds.  Hostess was nice, we were seated right away.  Waiter comes and takes our order, and then we wait.  And wait.  And wait.  45 minutes passes, no food, and I haven't seen our waiter in at least 25 min.  I flag down the hostess, who says she will find out what is going on.  About 3 min later I see our waiter saunter in from out of the restaurant.  He goes to the back, and surprise surprise, our food is ready!\n\nI had ordered a burger, my wife the night's special, a sirloin steak, medium well.  The steak was burned to a crisp, definitely medium well.  My burger, while it did not appear burnt, tasted burnt.  The bun was soggy as well.  Not what we expected after waiting 45 min.  We contacted the manager who was very apologetic, and offered to get us some cold sandwiches from the menu.  We declined and he did not ask us to pay for the meals.  He said that he would be talking to the cook about it.\n\nWe will not be going into this restaurant on our next Vegas trip.  Seriously, you are better off going to Denny's or McDonalds if you are hungry late at night."
0,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with the service I received from this place.  I went there with my family and the waitress seemed as if she did not want to serve us, or she just was having a bad day however when you are in a customer service job you should make the customers feel as if they are there to have a good time.  I am sad to say that the bad service over shadowed the good food that they served. If you don't mind a hit and miss on service have a good time cause the food is very good."
1,"Went to Lao Laan-Xang for lunch on a quiet Saturday and had a delightful meal. My order was for one vegetarian egg roll as an appetizer, the Gang Gallie curry with chicken, and jasmine tea.\n\nThe egg roll took a while to get out to me, but was hot and fresh. It was fat but not overstuffed, filled with cabbage, carrot and some other vegetables along with a good taste of seasoning. The wrap wasn't under-cooked on the on the inside like so many other egg rolls I've tried. I'm pretty sure the sweet & sour that came with was homemade, but it was so light in flavor it was unnoticeable against the bold seasoning of the egg roll itself. Kind of a shame, really.\n\nThe Gang Gallie was a yellow curry and coconut milk base with chicken, green beans, potato, onion, Thai eggplant, and what I think was acorn squash -- it definately wasn't carrot as it said on the menu. They served it in the ceramic cooking vessel and the portion size was incredibly generous. A massive bowl of white rice was served alongside for ultimate carb overload effect. It may have cost $11.95 on the menu, but I was able to take home enough to make a second meal. The curry was very nice; all the vegetables were cooked just right and the flavor of the vegetables came through the spice.\n\nMy jasmine tea was good. Enough said. =o)\n\nAs far as spiciness goes, I had ordered the curry at spice level 4. On the menu this is described as \""Native Lao\"" and I think that's accurate; you could eat this continuously without \""overheating\"", so to speak. They're not trying to hurt you. It's spicy, but not crazy...if you are comfortable with spicy food, order at a 4. It's not overpowering.\n\nService was attentive and nice. It's a small restaurant, so only one cook and one waitstaff was on duty. The food came out slowly but not unbearably so. Lao Laan-Xang was quite fairly priced and the food was good. If you haven't been, it's worth the visit."
1,"I have tried a few different classes & have really liked all of them. The instructors are great and very kind. The classes/workouts are fun, and intense. The location makes for really easy access. They also sell really cute workout clothes (both their own brand and Lulu Lemon).  I would recommend it for sure- I love it."
0,"My husband had been bugging me to try this place for a while now, so I finally gave in. I am not a big waffle eater but I decided to get one and a coffee. I came in with my husband and daughter at 3pm on Good Friday. One person was working, a young girl. She asked what we wanted. I asked her to give me a minute, I had never been here before. So I got a waffle with bacon and maple icing, my husband got the cinammon roll waffle and my daughter got a plain waffle with whipped cream. I saw a waffle maker, but she put our pre-made waffles, not made to order, in a toaster oven type thing and heated it up. Maybe the waffle maker is just for show. I also ordered a coffee, no coffee in any container. I advised the girl and she said she would get some. So she proceeded to heat up our waffles, bring them to the table, make the two ladies behind us some coffee. At this point I was slightly frustrated. Not only did my waffle, which by the way is the size of a pop tart, taste like card board,it wasn't even hot.I could barely cut it with the plastic knife and fork. I went to the counter to tell the girl I no longer wanted my coffee, and I would like my money back. She states, It's almost ready. I also advised her the waffles were horrible. I asked her if I could get the manager's name and number. She said, he isn't here. I just gave up at this point. She did provide me with the owners name and the email for the business. I just think that for $4.50 a waffle, they would be made to order. I never did get my money back either. So we just walked out, without my coffee. We will definitely NOT be going back. They should also have planned better for a Holiday and get people in there that actually want to be there, and be helpful."
0,"Came into the store to get paint for 5 rooms, so only 10 gallons, small order for them, but big for me. One guy working with a customer. 4 more customers came in and the sales guys emerged from the back to assist and jumped on them. I stood at the color wall staring at the sales man as he avoided eye contact with me.  I even verbalized the lack off assistance and was ignored. Watched the guy walk in back after actually making eye contact. Horrible service. Maybe they should stick to contractors and stop pretending they like to help the general public. Sales associate that finally did assist was brand new and was helpful and charming. When the new guy is out servicing the veterans something in the business model has failed."
1,"WOOHOOOO\n\nAfter a miserable flu week of tasteless food, a friend recommended How Lee, saying that the sichuan food will clear my congestion. As someone that loves any and all spicy foods, I was up for the challenge. As the many of the past reviewers wrote, YOU MUST ORDER FROM THE SICHUAN MENU! You will be greatly rewarded for doing so!\n\nThe chili pots put me in a flurry and by the end of a meal, clothes were shed and I was left panting...sure enough my congestion was gone. Delicious delicious delicious.\n\np.s. This isn't the How Lee from a few years back. New management really means muuuch much better food!"
1,"Fun stuff!  My raft flipped taking all 8 of us (includes guide) overboard.  A few of us had some cuts from bumping up against the rocks.  It would have been nice if the guide had directed us to the first aid area after we finished...but we had to go find antibiotic ointment and bandaids on our own.  Other than that, I'd do it again."
0,"Just a quick one. The food is pretty good but the service is bad. I have gone 3 times and endured terrible service for the food, every time swearing I won't come back. LOL If you can stand the bad service the food is worth it or maybe not. Coin flip decision at best."
0,"Oh man.. well overpriced drinks, and small portions (including on drinks) makes me laugh. One person in my party got crown on the rocks, i swear they were serving him his drink from their shot glasses.  RIP OFF!\n\nThe view is good (not great), the bull is real. the servers are good people, the atmosphere is typical for a steak place. That is where my positive experience ends.\n\nWhile scanning the menu i got to look out over Phoenix, it was nice to see all the \""mountains\"" surrounding the city (i am used to seeing the Rocky and Olympic Mountains so yeah. not really mountains to me). Back to the important part everyone...the food. They were greatly overpriced...well my first thought was okay priced high food must be great!...hmmm if satisfaction is guaranteed, well they need to give a bunch of refunds. \n\nThe burgers my friend got, looked dry and zero character. It looked like the super mondo burger from Goodburger..you know that dry fake looking one. Obviously the burger wasn't that huge, but it looked lame. The pork chop was also VERY dry. Like yeah, i know we are in arizona and most things are dry, but leave the food out of it. It is as if they squeezed the juices out of it. Even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible. I got the prime rib. OH YEAH! well thats what i thought. Horse radish was old, lost its pizzazz and kick. They definitely cut the prime rib too early after it was cooked because the juices were gone.. and ontop of that i am pretty sure it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile too (warm but not hot.. booo). Not sure how everyone elses food was, but from viewing it i was less than impressed... Oh and talk about cheap...you can't get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money. The sides they supply you with is half a corn on the cob, and a skimpy helping of green beans.\n\nAnd just to pour a little salt on their already bad yelp from me.. Their cinnamon butter was a sad excuse.. I've had SOO much better before. It was lacking in all areas of its life.\n\n\nWant to know where you can go and get better food, same ambiance, and decent service (but no view of phx)...Texas Roadhouse...yeah i said it..i am bringing a chain into the discussion.. I would hands down go to TRH any day instead of here.\n\nEnd of the line 1 star because the food was blech! 1/2 a star for the view and 1/2 star for good service...yup two stars...(to get that view just drive to the top of the hill and look out soo maybe i should take away one.. HA)"
0,"Terrible service, waited 20 mins between wings with waitresses standing around. It is slow there are barely any people here. This is ridiculous!!!! This has happened 4 weeks in a row... I do not recommend coming here if you are hungry. Drive to a different one and in sure you'll get better service."
1,"One afternoon, as the All Stars were about to take to Chase Field and play America's favorite pastime, we stopped into Marjele's for a bite to eat. First of all, it was July and for people like us who live in Arizona, the heat is here to stay and we learn to deal with it. However, for visitors from all around, the 110 degree weather means that they will not eat outside. So we had the choice to wait for an indoor table or take the patio seating that had immediate seating -- and I mean, every seat was available on the patio. The hostess looked at us like we were crazy as we took the patio and we proceeded to order food. Now, contrary to common belief, just because a sports bar is named after an athlete, doesn't mean that athlete frequents there every day. But on this particular day, Dan Marjele happened to walk into Marjeles. The irony cracked us up because we knew that the out of towners probably assumed this is a regular occurrence. And hey, maybe it is! \n\nAnyway, this is the perfect bar to grab a quick and decent bite to eat before a sporting event downtown. The buffalo chicken is delicious, as is the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and any other wrap on the menu. It's one or two notches above generic bar food and the drinks also flow nicely. They have plenty of TVs inside so even if you don't go to the game, it's still a fun atmosphere to sit and watch the game on the TV. \n\nI wouldn't drive to Downtown Phoenix just to visit Marjeles, but this is definitely one of my choices when I'm looking for a sports bar before or after the game in Downtown Phoenix."
0,"I was accepted to dance with the Arizona ballet and the London ballet - well over twenty years ago.  I'm not in any kind of shape - my knees are stiff and I'm at least twenty pounds over weight with little to no exercise.  I wanted desperately to get back into ballet, so I purchased the GroupOn that allowed unlimited classes for one month.  Lisa (I'm not certain of her name, she is also in the Group On video on their website) in 'beginning ballet for adults' had me in TEARS my first class, which I practically RAN out of.  \nShe very obviously does not care about form and is well on her way to hurting someone.  Pushing groups of women that have little to no experience and without teaching proper form is not the way to encourage true ballet.  Regardless of my own body's abilities, I know what the dance looks like when done properly  - and no one in that class was doing it well enough for the level they were dancing at (safely).  A \""beginner\"" class that allows you to wear socks has no business doing the moves she expects - especially when she doesn't correct anyone's form!  Ballet has form to PREVENT injury!  Ballet takes time to BUILD muscle!  \nFor people that want to dance improperly and chance a serious injury - this may be the place to go.  Otherwise, get a proper instructor.  \nAfter twenty years off shoe my body is not in any shape to do what she expected of me (and others).  I was in tears when I left - and I had so been looking forward to this class!  I would say stay away from Lisa.  Her reactions during class seemed passive aggressive, commenting on my turn out as excellent but then refusing to listen when my comments about difficulty went unheeded.  There were no modified moves - I was forced to stand alone and do modifications as I saw fit.  As an insurance underwriter I can only recommend they stock up on Professional Liability- they are really setting themselves up for a lawsuit, regardless of the waiver of liability you must sign prior to class.  \nOn the other hand, Peter (part owner) was amazing - he is very kind and spends lots of time explaining to me that I had nothing to fear and that the beginner class would be fine for me - and then obviously feeling bad about my humiliation.  If I had started with a different instructor I'm quite sure that my entire experience would be different - I loved the studio and environment and other women, but I am far too humiliated to return and attend any other class!!"
0,I went to this bar to get drinks with some family from out of town on Saturday and had the worst experience I've ever had at a bar in Las Vegas. The bartender measured every ingredient for every drink. I have never seen a bartender anywhere in vegas have to measure. The drinks were very weak and were definitely not worth the $15 per drink we paid. If the bartender had been at least a little personable it would have made up for it but I couldn't get a conversation flowing with him no matter what I tried to talk to him about. I more than likely won't be going back unless I have family or friends staying at the Monte Carlo.
1,I am very happy I called Care Pro. They were on time and did a great job! Their prices are also affordable. I will be using them in the future.
0,"We ordered two main dishes,it was like they double the salt for one and didn't put any for the other. They also forced a big tip without providing any service."
0,"I have been a Gold Member for 3 years and I've been to a lot of Starbucks locations inside and outside of the country. I have experienced different customer service at all locations and this location is just the worst. This specific location seriously has the worst waiting time ever (drive thru)!!!! I have been to the busiest Starbucks in the world and they do not take this long. Every time I go here they always seem to mess up my drink in some way or another but I don't have time to go back and wait in that 15 minute line. \n\nIf I could I wouldn't give this location any stars. Today I decided to walk in and not do drive thru, since I always have to wait more than 15 minutes. The lady who helped me was very nice and she was quick to ring me up but all of their employees work so slow and take forever to think about what they need to do."

0,"Good wine and drink selection. Good deserts. Have eaten there 3 times. Last time contracted food poisoning and restaurant denied that could have happened. Funny that my girlfriend and I ate the same thing-Lamb, and we both were pretty sick that night and the next day. \nOwners were called and they said they would reimburse us (ie: check will be in the mail). Never received a check.  We then wrote a letter to them and still were not reimbursed. Shame that they do not stand behind  (pun intended) their product."
0,"I went here with my husband on a friday. Less than half capacity and seated ourselves. After seating we waited about 10 minutes to place our order. Our drinks were served after another 5 minutes and we waited and waited for our pancakes... more than 25 minutes. Once the food arrived we were so excited to dig into our meals. I noticed the nice scoop of softly melting butter onto of my  banana waffle and it actually looked so fluffy and light I tasted a small bit to be sure it wasn't whip cream. My mouth was greeted by a small, but overwhelmingly crucial detail....they used salted butter. Not just lightly salted butter....this was REALLY salty butter. I quickly try to scrape as much butter off the pancake, but alas, it had mostly already soaked into the waffle. Even after pouring more than a comfortable amount of maple syrup onto the waffle it was so salty. I tried to move on to the bacon instead and then I really got upset. THEY SALTED THE BACON TOO!!!!  Who does that?!?! It was inedible, but even a little bit made my mouth dry. I asked my husband about his meal and he had the same problem. Salty pancakes.  So, terrible food and lackluster service make this a no-go in my book. Sorry, wanted to like it. Just didn't happen."
0,"We have ordered their food several times and eaten at the restaurant as well. We love the camelback and 16th street location so we really want this location to succeed. \n\nSadly each time we have had their food we have noticed a decline in quality. Tonight we ordered two salads- the Chelsea chopped salad and the antipasti salad. The salads now appear to all use the same generic ice berg lettuce base and have a few custom ingredients sprinkled on top. This was not the case in the past. When you spend close to $10 per salad I think you can expect something more than cheap, bagged, ice berg lettuce with a handful of almonds and sun dried tomatoes sprinkled on top."
1,"By far one of the cleanest Dairy Queen which is a plus for me. \n\nMy coworkers and I had lunch here since we were craving for some Blizzards, so Dairy Queen was what we all voted on. I ordered the chicken strips basket which came with fries, toast and 4 chicken strips. I also ordered a Butterfinger Blizzard, which was delicious and satisfied my craving for some ice cream and candy. \n\nThe staff was really friendly and asked if we wanted our blizzards after our meal so it wouldn't melt. I also order my coworker a blizzard since he couldn't come with us and the lady put in the freezer so when we were done we can just grab it."
1,"-East End Brewing is a very small operation.  They are located in a small garage type building.  Once inside it's simply just some taps, a small bar area and a merchandise table.  They only sell 2-3 beers in bottles.\n\n-As for the beers, they allow you to sample any of them.  I was a BIG fan of the pumpkin. Besides Southern Tier Pumpking this was my favorite pumpkin beer I had tried up until that point. I also was a big fan of the Harvest beer.  So I took two growlers home of those and bought two glasses. \n\n-I recommend taking a trip there, try the beers, get a growler and enjoy!"
1,"I don't really like pizza but I LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!!\n\nAnthony's started off on the right foot by giving out free slices of pizza, or a whole pie if you were taking it back to the co-workers.  It only got better from there...\n\nDelicious pizza, great fresh toppings, and a quick lunch option downtown!  The french fries are excellent.  There's too much chicken to eat when you order chicken strips.  The lasagna is yummy and the salads look great!\n\nThe staff is wonderful, they remember you and your order and the service is always quick even when they're busy.  If you work downtwon the trick is to call in your order and pick it up about 10 minutes later.  They'll let you skip to the front of the line to pay and your pizza will be waiting when you walk in the door.  \n\nMy personal favorite = sliced meatballs + onions.  The pizza itself if the perfect balance of excellent cheese and sauce  that isn't too sweet.  The meatballs are better than regular sausage because they're perfectly seasoned and don't fall off your pizza :)"
1,"Menu is a tex-mex hybrid featuring unique takes on nachos and Mexican fare.\n\nShared the bbq chicken nachos with the husband. The bbq flavor has a great sweet and savory combo with a slight chili powder dimension that is great to eat! The black beans, corn and white cheese go well with the succulent chicken. Although it was a great change to traditional nachos, we did miss the sour cream and guac you expect to find with nachos.\n\nWe will more than likely head back to another one of the Nacho Daddy locations."
0,"Good food can be quickly forgotten by bad service.  I'm sorry that you've got the table from hell, but out table is important too!\n\nThe micro brew samplers were interesting and tasty, but nothing else screamed repeat and come back here."
0,"This restaurant is mediocre Chinese type at best... Ordered the green curry and a red curry... The green curry was a lumpy, floating in grease mess.  The red was equally as greasy and neither had coconut milk in them??  I can't believe this place is still in business.  We did call as soon as the containers were opened to ask exactly WTH they were, and they were quick to offer a refund to our card (something tells me they get many similar calls)... Not authentic thai by far."
1,I was here Saturday for the first time . I have heard nothing but great things about this place so I had to try it out even though I am no huge fan of German food . The restaurant is huge with two big outdoor seating areas . I was  impressed with the fast friendly service . A great place for a large group . The food was very good as well .
0,"I love salad bars. Love. LOVE. \n\nBut I can't eat here. And by that I don't mean that it isn't veg-friendly - it most def is - I mean that the quality of ingredients, salad, toppings, potato bar, made-from-powder soups are so low that I get scared. Fear is an appetite inhibitor. \n\nI've hit this trough three times, and had gurgley tummy after each and every one. The ladies that work here are totally great - even acknowledge and remove and replace, say, the cukes, when I express concerns about their harboring of evil bacteriums and such (WOW they smelled weird last time I was here). But any effort on my part to save my and others' bellies from grossville feels like polishing the brass on the Titanic. \n\nSo I continue to harass Sweet Tomatoes via email, monthly, with the hopes that one day we'll actually have a decent Bar in Charlotte. Fingers crossed. I might start a petition. Let me know if you want to sign."
1,"I love this place! The owner is an awesome guy who's usually there during the day, making sure all the food is wonderful. They make some of the best chili I've ever had. The beef sandwiches (I get them with hot peppers and cheddar) and the cheeseburgers are must haves. All the food is cooked fresh within sight! I crave this place on a daily basis and I usually end up going 3-4 times a week. The prices aren't bad, a little pricey for myself (a broke, hungry college student) but the portions are always generous. I would take a star off because they don't have milkshakes (and I would sure love a good milkshake with this food) but everything else is so good that giving only four stars wouldn't do it justice!"
0,"We went to Chompies on Tatum to have a nice Sunday breakfast and got the waiter from hell...Donald. He was rude - acted like he was doing us a great favor by waiting on us,  we had to ask for coffee refills over and over, when our orders came 75% of them were incorrect and then when the bill came, it was all screwed up and had to be changed at least twice to finally get it right, What the heck??? This is what he chooses to do. He is an horrible representative for Chompies. We will never sit in his section again, that is if he is still employed there. We love their food and most of all of their servers but this guy ruined it for us for a while. Most sad. A dining experience should not be like that."
1,Excellent place to hang out. Friendly group of people. The employees are very knowledgeable and the coffee bar is excellent.
0,"The decor is great, the bartenders are pretty and the music is good but the drinks are awful and the crowd could use some seeding out for a place calling itself an ultra lounge. If this is a martini bar, then they should know how to make one, no? A dry martini here is a glass full of olive brine that the bartender will cheerfully tell she just got from the garnishes bin because she couldn't find the other stuff they use..."
1,"Came in yesterday and I'm glad that a cute coffee shop like this finally opened up around my area! I decided to share tea and the Irish cream cake with my cousin and both were great. I even came back a second time that same night with some friends and tried another flavor of tea and my friend's pistachio latte. I will definitely get that latte again during another visit. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would like to see more pastries and desserts, but overall everything else is great!"

0,"I have been shopping here for 25 years but no more - because of the incident there today. I bought what was labeled as tempera paint (and the label clearly states it washes off with soap and water) for a sidewalk/street painting project for a Festival and the product is clearly misrepresented.  I scrubbed for two hours with a push broom and soapy water to try to remove the so called tempera paint with absolutely no success with a couple of the colors - and partial success with a couple of others.  The Streets and Transportation Dept. finally had to come paint over it.  When I tried to take the paint back with my complaint I was basically told that oh, this is a high quality tempera paint that is made to last.  So why does the label say it washes off with soapy water?  They tried to imply it would not come off because of the unusual surface, but then went on to say it is meant to stick to anything and stay there because it is high quality tempera.  I asked what the difference was then between the tempera they are selling and acrylic paint and could get no good answer (oh, we can call the manufacturer and ask what is in it!).  I have always been a bit irked by their so called discounts for Artlink members, when in reality whenever you ask for a discount you are invariably told the item is already on sale, therefore not eligible for a discount.  From now on I will be taking my business to Jerry's Artarama, even though it is all the way over in Tempe."
0,"It's got a ways to go. I debated a season pass the good part is they let you try the park out and if you have your receipt you can pay the difference for a season pass. I had $100 worth of cowabunga cash i wanted to use for admission, for some reason they kept ringing up invalid so the cashier had to get her boss who had to get his boss in which we waited a good 15 minutes for someone to fix the situation. I will have to come back to give a proper review but as of today a part of the park isn't open and 2 slides are not up. The green slide is down because its \""too fast\"". Employees were friendly and a few asked \""did we enjoy the park?\"" Which means they really care, however one cashier had no idea how to work the cash register and I ordered nachos which came with the tiniest cup of cheese and if I wanted more it was .75 cents it wasn't even enough for half the chips. Also, there were three icee machines and only one was working (watermelon/pi\u00f1a colada) and none of the soda machines were operational. I think next year I will buy a pass but not this year."
0,"We have seen many shows in Vegas and Broadway including all of the cirque de soleil shows. We were very excited to see Michael Jackson's One. To give this show a \""c\"" would be generous. This is the type of show you would expect to see on a low level cruise ship. Do not waste your money, stay home and watch Michael Jackson videos on YouTube. Instead go see Absinthe, it's fantastic."

0,"This is right around the corner from our house so we frequent occasionally. The BF likes it more then I do but it's not terrible by any means. \n\nI like it because when I walk in I sorta feel like I'm in The City. I love The City! Today it smelled like a latke!! Oh man did it smell gooood!! I believe they make a lot of their product in house but I can't buy that they make all or most. That would be a lot of labor hours. BUT, I love their selection! The Rainbow cookies are to die for!! Non Nom Nom I think I've tried pretty much everything in their pastry case. If it looks like it might be dry and stale it probably is but they have a lot of wonderful things, too. The bagels are great and they have seasonal flavors as well as flavored cream cheeses. \n\nSo on our visit today the BF got his usual Eggs Benedict, which he said this time wasn't as good as it had been before. He said it was bland but he said it might have been because he's getting over a head cold. I mix it up here, today I got the Corned Beef Hase! Yum! It was so good! Their eggs are also cooked perfect! I got the pumpkin bagel with pumpkin cream cheese. Yum again! With plenty leftover for tomorrow's breakfast! \n\nThe service is usually pretty standard. Friendly not over doing it not rude. Today we waited a lot longer then usual for our food to come and she dropped the check when she checked to see how our food was. I was afraid that meant she wasn't coming back again. I knew I was going to need a box and I hate being the one that's flagging someone down. Luckily she did. But that's more of a panic thing for me I was in the restaurant business and I have a lot of peeves, many that even annoy myself. So that's just one of them. The cashier girl was as basic as she could have been. No how are you, how was your meal. That would be my only complaint. \n\nOverall, we like Bagel Cafe and well be back.\n\n\n********I left this review as is to show I previously liked Bagel Cafe. But I changed my star rating to reflect my updated review**********"
0,"Leave it to the anti-club girl to pooh-pooh the Rehab.\n\nThe Hard Rock pools are undeniably amazing.  There are slides, lazy rivers, and wading pools as far as the eye can see.  However, during Rehab they turn into mud laden cess pools of post-clubber's dirt and vodka sweats.\n\nI went here with an out-of-town friend of mine who assured me that their 'cred' could get me into the club for free.  Funnily enough, their 'cred' counted for nothing and the fact that I went to school with the bouncer spared my pocketbook.  If I had paid $20 for admission, this would be a one star review.\n\nThe place is crowded.  Period.  Uncomfortably so.  And most of the people are ridiculously drunk, so walking's an issue.  Grit from the pool clings to your body long after you've exited.\n\nFor tourists who don't get to see girls in bikinis much, this is probably a very neat experience.  For locals, there are a lot of other pools you can sneak into for free without the risk of disease."
0,"After dining at Beaver Choice tonite,  I decided to read a few reviews before writing mine.  Incredible how many people experienced lengthy waits for their food.  We waited well over an hour for our entrees.  The owner explained that two chefs called out sick from out of town (apparently enjoying the holidays) but that wouldn't explain the other reviewers who had similar experiences the other eleven months of the year.  The food was all good.  My wife and I both had the Jager schnitzel.  The sides, especially the beets with horseradish were very good as well.  One reviewer who ate there a month ago said they were out of Polish potato dumplings.   Well, they're still out of them.  The wine list is small, inexpensive and unimpressive.   There are no beers on draft.  The best part was after we left and I discovered I left my VISA there.  I returned only ten minutes later and the owner didn't seem to remember me.  Then she suggested that a lot of people \""think\"" they forgot to take their card, implying that maybe I left it somewhere else.  To make a long story short, it was still in the waitress' pocket.  The owner doesn't know how to run a restaurant and we won't be back.  If I want a great schnitzel, we'll just have to return to Germany or Austria; they know how to cook and serve."
0,Customer service is missing for the most part but not the worst. Management is a joke and lazy or rude if not both. Good idea to check packaging of items especially electronics and try to get the customer service you deserve so maybe it becomes something they do on their own.
0,"Was the only white person in there, stared at right away, WHATEVER! my money is jsut as good as the other peoples right?! food was MEH. bread was stale and toasted. not a nice combo. meat wasnt well cut, or seasoned. The fresh flowers were a nice touch, but thats about it."
1,"I just joined today and the biggest reason for the membership is the distance to my home (1 mile away).  The gym itself is beautiful inside and out and they are a little too cocky in my opinion.  They also said that their prices are non-negotiable which is nice as long as I don't find out someone is paying less than me which always happens.  I came from a 2 year membership at 24hr Fitness for $300 which is a smoking deal since it comes out to $12/month but closest gym is 43ave & Bell.  I agree with Bianca the shower curtains look like there is mold on them and my salesperson told me that their prices are higher because they are a high end gym which means that the water should be soften in my opinion.  I mean I have soft water at home and wouldn't call my home high end.  Anyway, I worked out here for the first time and all the equipment is 1st class nice new equipment, I thought it was odd that there was only ONE flat bench press which means I wont be doing that much.  Good thing there is lots of other nice equipment to work out with.  I love all the cardio machines and how everyone has its own TV.  The entire atmosphere is really, really nice.  There is a large movie screen room as you enter the bathrooms, there is several showers, and nice lockers with plenty of room to change.  There is carpet in the bathroom locker area which is OK as long as it is replaced every few years because that would be gross.  There is all kinds of other services and a great snack bar and the kids area seems cool with surveillance for anyone to see what is going on.  My biggest complaint about this place is that there is no jacuzzi, I love using them after a workout because it relaxes my muscles and is very therapeutic (only reason I took a star away).  Other than that I really enjoyed the work out and hope that this review stays at 4 stars....I mean I hope they get a jacuzzi so I can give them back a star."
0,"When you go out to dinner, you want good food and sometimes, good service and a pleasantly friendly staff just are not enough.  The sushi at Pearl is not really good.  I was disappointed at the rolls - the accompanying sauces were colorful although boring and tasteless.  I tried a roll with a slice of tuna on the top and the tuna was a little warm - NOT what you want when eating sush.  I had the yellowfin - and was not impressed.  The quality of the fish was off.  I also tried the calamari which was fried in a funky batter which over powered the taste of the calamari.  \nI have to admit that after two rolls, calamari and yellowfin tuna, I stopped ordering bc the food did not taste good.  \nThe one great thing about Pearl is the service and the staff.  They are friendly, but not in an annoying way.  They tried very hard to please my party and I liked it.  When they found out we would be writing a review for yelp - the free shots came - and that was a nice BONUS. ;) \nI recommended to the my server and a woman he introduced as a manager that the place needed some sushi quality aspects to it, i.e. fresh warm towels prior to the meal as any self respecting sushi eater, eats with their hands. The manager replied, \""that was not a good idea because this is an asian restaurant.\""  Yikes, right?  She was friendly and kind but her ignorance was pretty disappointing.\nI unfortuantely will not be going back to Pearl to eat again - however, I would go back for the drinks and the fun service!"
1,"The best Japanese restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas. It is small, so you should try to make a reservation if you want to go there during peak hours."
0,"I have been to Le Thai on numbers occasions.  I wanted to go there tonight with a few friends.  I looked up their number on their website but had to visit yelp for the number because they didn't list it on their site?  When I called, I received the VM stating to call back or email them.  I sent an email requesting a reservation for 4 ppl.  The nice lady called me back stating reservations are only taken for larger groups.  Normally I wouldn't care but it is 40 degrees and a Wednesday.  I'm officially turned off by this policy and will maybe revisit if this changes but until then a customer has been lost."
0,$37 bar tab for 4 beers...really?  Ambiance is not very good. We never go past the beers..the menu is outrageously priced.   No Way.
1,"Just went back, still in awe of the place.  \n\nWanted to throw my vote behind the smoked gouda spinach dip.  Quite tasty."
0,I will NEVER go back to Soyo.  The food actually was not that bad.  However the service was deplorable.  They just don't seem to care.\n\nWe even had Korean speaking people at our table and their lunch was ruined because of the service.
0,"I was promised a room full of elbows, and the Elbow Room seriously under-delivered.\n\nAdditionally, I was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection. When I asked our waiter what was on tap, he could not name a single choice. Its not a huge problem for me, but considering this place is somewhat of a pub, it would probably be wise to memorize a few choices. I had the Norman Rockwell Burger which was actually very good. The egg was perfectly fried and the burger was cooked precisely how I requested. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the crappy bun detracted from the burger as a whole, but overall I was happy. The fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course. My lady-friend's turkey-whatever sandwich was okay, nothing to get excited over.\n\nThe food itself deserves 3 stars, but the overall environment felt strange to me, hence 2 stars."
1,"This past weekend I had home to Vegas with my friends and then I met this amazing guy there and he wanted to take me to dinner... He said I'll look for something and looked at the reviews on yelp and made reservations! \n\nAs soon as we walked in I could tell he was really into making an impression because the decor was stunning!  The atmosphere was elegant and sophisticated. \n\nOur server was amazing and patient.  We sat down and started the whole first date questions and every time our server would come we would me so wrapped up in our conversation we would forget to order lol.  But our server was more than happy to come back every time. \n\nThe food was amazing, my date said he didn't like salmon because it was too fishy but he has a taste of my plate and was so amazed.  The sauces were amazing and I have tried salmon every where and this was definitely in my top 3!!  \n\nGo here is you want a great dinner and time away from the whole party scene for a while.  It's so great!"
1,"This is probably the best smoke shop ive been to in the area. They have a very large variety of items from glass, tobacco and cigars. They have the widest options of hookah supplys and flavors that ive seen in any store. This os a place i'll be sure to go back too."
0,"In a word: HORRENDOUS!\nI don't think anything I will state in this review will be news.  Their check-in process needs major workflow evaluation.  We got there at 7:30pm and it took almost 45 minutes to get to the desk.  That's ridiculous and I can only imagine what it would have been at 4pm.\nThe front desk clerk immediately informed me that the king bed we requested wasn't available, but we could upgrade to a luxury room. No sorry, no concern, just... an upsell.  I informed her that we would stick with what was given to us, but she quickly informs us that once we get into the room and decide we want to upgrade to a \""luxury\"" room, go back down and let her know and she would change our rooms.  As we went to the Mediterranean Tower, we noticed that the hallways were dimly lit, the carpets were stained, and there was a musty smell.  This was indicative of what we found inside as well.  The room was VERY dated, the air conditioning was sputtering, and state of the furnishings were sad.  We immediately picked up the phone to inform the front desk that we would like to upgrade.  The man who picked up flat out denied our request for an upgrade.  Mind you, we said we were willing to pay for the upgrade, we weren't looking for a handout.  The man stated that since we step foot into the room, he would have to have it cleaned and he didn't have the staffing for that.  We explained that the front desk clerk who checked us in offered to have us examine the room first.  He states that she wasn't allowed to do that and he will not upgrade us.  We asked to speak with a manager and he states that he WAS the hotel manager.  If this was indeed the case, this is the worst customer service I've encountered.  What hotel would refuse a customer PAYING for an upgrade?  He then states that he can send a maid up to tidy up the room if we were unhappy... but weren't we just informed that he didn't have the staff for that?  So the maid he was going to send up wouldn't be the same one who can clean the room we had \""soiled\"" by just stepping in?  Things didn't add up.\nAnyhow, the room was in shambles, as you can see from the pictures I'll post.  Mold in the shower, peeling wallpaper, soiled/ripped linens, the list goes on and on.  We didn't expect a 5 star hotel, but the dilapidated room PLUS the ridiculous management really soured our stay.  Never again for us or anyone we know."
0,"Montevida was a decent place to live for the year we were there. It became more inconvenient to get in and out as the light rail construction ramped up. The office staff had a \""Can I help you?\"" type of attitude as soon as the lease was signed as oppose to the \""How may I help?\"" they treat you with when trying to lure you in. The maintenance was okay. They usually had a quick fix approach as oppose to fully solving the problem. The apartment layout was nice and unique, spacious closets, nice bathroom. \n\nMy BIGGEST complaint was how they advised me to have the carpet professionally cleaned when we moved out, so that they would not include this as deduction from our security deposit refund.  After turning it a signed receipt from the cleaning company (as requested), they have failed to remove this as deduction. After multiple visits and six months later, they have failed to refund this."
1,"I'm amazed to have found you considering how vague of a description I received. \n\n\""stand on the corner in downtown, and you will see a small sign that says cocktails.. I think.\""\n\nWell, I didn't find you. I gave up and proceeded with my entourage to enjoy the shenanigans found in DT LV. Then waiting for the light to turn green, I see the sign. Downtown. A neon lit picture of a cocktail. This MUST be the place!\n\nWe scope it out, and sure enough, craft cocktails have been found. I proceeded to order items not on the menu because I'm a pain in the ass like that. The bartender did a fair job of making all three drinks and we enjoyed the lounge area around the back. Next time, I will try some of your house cocktails - I promise!"
1,I went for dinner on a Tuesday night.  I did not order the $1.50 Original Fish Tacos.  They were located on West Sahara Ave/S Ft Apache Rd in Las Vegas.\n\nI had a coupon for free chips and guacamole with the purchase of an entree.  i ordered my favorite Chipotle Shrimp Salad.  i was disappointed that there were no fresno chiles on the salad like they have at other locations.  Maybe the person making the salad forgot to put them on.\n\nI will be back!
1,"I stopped by Charlotte on my way from San Francisco to Rochester, only 40 mins or so change over time. I rushed from Concourse C to Concourse B just for this famous southern flavor chicken and biscuit. To be honest, the biscuits didn't fail my expectation: really the best that I've ever eaten in US. But the chicken, despite the crispy surface and tender inside, was a little bit mild and weak in flavor. Anyway, it's wonderful to taste something exclusively offered in southeast region."
1,"I got to talk with \""Crazy Ken\"", he is a great guy and kept encouraging me to go group riding which i will do. I literally came in to burn time, but to be honest i had the best experience i ever had in a bike shop. No one gave me snobby looks, he listened to my confusion and self proclaimed cluelessness for what i was really doing. He helped me out a lot. We got to talk a lot about my bike, and i am pretty sure i want this to be \""My bike shop\""."
0,"Had a very long line on a Sunday afternoon, but the wait wasn't bad at all. \n\nThe food on the other hand was sub-par, and if I didn't know about the far superior location in SD I wouldnt consider going to another HHGG. \n\nThe bacon waffle was tough and almost flavor-less, and the eggs served w it were cold. The meatloaf hash was alright; the large meatloaf chunks were pretty good, but still wasn't very impressed. \n\nOh well, guess the poor quality of food at the Vegas location will make me appreciate the awesomeness of the SD food even more the next time I go!"
1,"First of all I need you guys to know that I am allergic to EVERYTHING! Grass,pollen,cats,dogs, and really anything else you can imagine. So when my friend told me about this place I almost burst into hives just thinking about it but luckily I was wrong. One of the girls who worked there went through the ingredients of everything I liked with me and I found a ton of great soaps and hair products that smelled good and wouldn't make me swell up. Everyone there was so nice and helpful without being suffocating. The smell going in is strong due to all the different stuff in there but I would recommend giving them a try. For you devote vegans out there they have quite a few products for you."
1,"This rating is 4.5 stars, but I rounded up instead of down since it was my first visit. I've been trying to get my husband to  Due Forni for a month after getting recommendations from friends/colleagues about great local pizza places in Summerlin. I even purchased a Groupon and was finally able to get him to go last night. We had been to other local pizzerias and have been disappointed, hence my husband's reluctance. \n\nWe were both surprised at the location -- Due Forni is about 5-10 minutes away -- an easy drive up the street from us and we had no clue it was so close. Another surprise happened when we walked in the door - seeing a familiar friendly face in Xavier, the manager, who greeted us warmly. He and my husband used to work together, so another plus for Due Forni. \n\nDF's has a nice outdoor patio, however, the wind was picking up, so we decided to eat inside. It has a nice cozy atmosphere, with cool Edison bulbs dangling on the ends of wires from the ceiling and flat screen TVs in the bar and main dining room, playing spaghetti westerns - which I had no idea what they were until Alex told us. Not sure if that's my cup of tea, would be cool to see Sophia Loren movies, or other Italian related movies, like Big Night, that would make a more pleasant back drop than cowboys dying on a flat screen...just my personal opinion.  Could make a diner lose their appetite. And while the lighting was cool, it was a bit dark and there wasn't additional ambient lighting on the table. My husband and I each had to use our cell phones to read the menu, which also doubled as a place mat. \n\nDespite the odd movie selection, the food was fantastic.  My husband and I each had a starter. He had the Beets Salad with basil pesto, arugula, goat cheese, toasted pistachios and fig vincotto. His salad, seemed to be the perfect starter size, whereas my Spinach Salad came out in a huge bowl.  It seemed to be an entire bag of spinach with fresh cherries, roasted walnuts, cabra vino & a light herb vinaigrette for $9.95. It was quite tasty and had some amazing mozzarella bites in it, however, it could've been a bit smaller and the high-sided bowl it was served in was a bit awkward when I wanted to rest my knife and fork between bites. There were a few fresh cherries, which had a nice sweetness to break up the bitterness of the spinach, although I wish there had been a few more, as well as candied walnuts. Instead there were a few roasted walnuts which had fallen to the bottom of the high sided bowl. The bowl was a wide funnel shape, so I had to keep tossing my salad with my knife and fork in order to get the other tidbits which sunk to the bottom of the bowl with bites of spinach. I think if they reduced the spinach salad by a third and served it in a lower bowl, added candied walnuts and a few more cherries to be more in balance with volume of spinach, and also add a few more pieces of mozzarella, it would be perfect.\n\nWhile the salad was good, I didn't want to eat the entire thing so I could save room for my main, which was the Tartufo pizza on Neopolitan crust (recommended by our waiter since the pizza has more substantive toppings). Thee Tartufo was well worth its $20.95 price with its black truffle, parmigiano reggiano crema, fontina fontal, roasted cremini, over easy-baked egg was melt in your mouth good. The cheese was perfectly melted and gooey, the black truffle was delicious and didn't overwhelm the cheese or the roasted mushrooms and the egg was a surprisingly delicious touch. The crust was definitely far better than the pizza crust at Settebellos, which was soggy and wet. The Neopolitan crust at Due Forni was the perfect combination of a light chewy interior with a crispy crunchy exterior. I normally don't eat the crust, but with this pizza, I made an exception since the texture was amazing and was perfect to sop some of the truffle oil on the other slices!  My husband had the Daily Lasagna, which was ham and cheese. Something that I would expect in a sandwich, but not in a lasagna, and while it was good, I probably would've opted for a different meat, like a spicy Italian sausage to balance the creaminess and richness of the cheese. It came out bubbling hot and smelled AH-mazing and the cheese and the b\u00e9chamel was spot on. \n\nWe didn't order dessert, however, Xavier sent out a complimentary bread pudding, which was delicious, but we were both so full from dinner that we only had a few bites. My husband and I both liked their wine list and that all of the wines they serve come by the bottle as well as the glass, which is an unexpected nice touch. The service was fast, the wait staff friendly and the overall experience was enjoyable. I just wish I had taken pictures to post with this review, but we were so hungry and it smelled so good, we didn't even think about taking photos until we were almost done! We'll definitely be back so I'll definitely take pics next time. I want to try the Prosciutto Panino, it sounds delicious."
0,I came in for lunch as I work nearby. The place was clean as far as I could tell  but the food was awful.  I ordered a teriyaki chicken and shrimp and the shrimp were very small and rubbery that accompanied my chicken pieces of an unknown source on a white bed of rice.  Only a few squirts of teriyaki sauce to top it off made the sauce scarce as well. I was very disappointed. Not coming back.
0,"The only thing good is the bread with oil and vinegar. Service sucks just as bad. Our waiter 2028 Michael who keeps disappearing, didn't even give us napkins. It's possible that they don't give good service because gratuaty is already added to your bill. I had a very salty spaghetti and meatballs and pizza. Food is waaaaay too salty"
1,"Great atomsphere and large inside with multiple pool tables, huge dance floor and private tables.  I went here with a group of friends on a Thursday night and it was surprisingly packed.  The hot bartenders pour strong drinks on the cheap and the crowd was fun to hang out with.  Probably one of the better gay bars in Vegas."
1,"The bahn mi with chicken apple sausage on a brioche bun might be the best frank I've had in my life. \n\nThe girl taking orders was funny and friendly. Took about ten minutes for us to get our dogs. They actually screwed up my friend's order, but replaced it with the correct sausage really quickly.\n\nPrices were reasonable for the quality."
1,"I rarely go to a new place without \""yelping\"" it but Bandera was closed for lunch.  So we rolled the dice to find a really great lunch. Service was excellent, atmosphere was casual and relaxed.  Half price wine on Tuesday.  Food was great.  We split Ahi Tuna tacos then a blue cheese burger.  LOVE jicama tortillas and the sweet potato tots with a hint of salty cheese on them... worth the trip!"
1,AMAZING food!  I'm a huge fan of New Mexican style food having lived in southern New Mexico for 10 years.  Si Se\u00f1or has captured the flavors (and heat) I love so much.  The prices are very reasonable and the entree sizes are generous.  My favorite is the red or green chile Enchilada Plate (with an over-easy fried egg on top)!  The Hatch green chile is very hot but has so much flavor it's definitely worth a little pain.  The margaritas are very good and the servers are nice and attentive.  They even finish off every entree with a fresh hot fluffy sopaipilla!  I'm definitely hooked (or maybe addicted?)!
1,"NOTE: This review is only for breakfast.\n\nBeautiful indoor and outdoor patio seating makes this a perfect setting for a nice and relaxing breakfast or brunch. Their eggs benedict and florentine are incredibly tasty with surprisingly decent prices.\n\nI've only been here twice for breakfast, so I have yet to experience this place for dinner. So far both times there was no wait or reservation needed since it was outside of the normal waking hours of the Vegas crowd."
1,"I was a little skeptical as I drove up to Ichiban Sichuan because when I looked into the window I didn't see anyone inside. As I walked into the restaurant (because I trust Yelper's reviews), the other half of the restaurant was packed. \n\nWe were promptly seated and given glasses of water along with a set of menus. After going over the vast menu, we decided on a mapo tofu, spicy dried intestines, and spicy fish hotpot with mushrooms. \n\nAll three dishes were out on the table within 10 minutes. I've never been to a restaurant where the food is served piping hot in a matter of minutes. All three dishes were delicious. The food wasn't too spicy, but it had a great flavor. The mapo tofu was served piping hot with tons of meat and spicy sauce. The fish hot pot was not too spicy but had a nice kick to it. There was plenty of fish along with a good portion of enoki mushrooms and bean sprouts. The dried intestines was a little disappointing. The flavor was good, but it wasn't as crispy as I expected. Overall the flavor of the food was excellent, but on the greasy side. So, if you don't have a iron stomach, you might want to only get one spicy dish. \n\nI definitely will be back one more time before I leave Madison. Thanks again Ichiban Sichuan for the delicious meal!!!"
0,Typical bar food nothing special. The bar is small and have been there a handful of times and the bar service is so lousy.   I have never had a fun time because of the service and always think twice before going back.
1,"Love this place, iv lived behind the sub factory for the past 4 years and more recently started going.. And now it's a 1-2 visits a week. Hot Pastrami! Roast beef melt.. Both amazing (something about the lightly toasted bread) and the hot italian. Please for your sake try this place and enjoy."
0,"I have been a customer of Thai Lahna for 12 years.  The service I have received on my last three visits has been so bad, I now pledge to never return.  I don't make this decision lightly because they have pretty good food.  Last night I placed an order to go and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 25 minutes later and was told it would be ready in another 10 minutes.  After waiting another 30 minutes (a total of 55 minutes since I had placed the order), I asked to see the manager who had been in the kitchen this whole time.  I was told she would be right out.  I stood there at the cash register another 10 minutes; no manager.  I asked again to see the manager (my food order was still not ready).  From the kitchen I heard \""Tell him I am too busy!\""  That was the last straw.  I asked for a refund on my credit card.  Instead of a refund, they charged my card a second time.  While she was fixing that, my order finally came out.  I told them to keep the food and give me my money, which they finally did.  This is a place where management has completely lost touch with what service is all about.  The girl at the counter was trying desperately to help me.  If the manager had put forth even a half effort, I might have been able to shrug it off.  Her total dismissal of the customer prompts me to take my business elsewhere.  I would encourage you to do likewise."
0,"My review of US Air is based on my trips after the merger with American.  I thought US Air was pretty decent before the merger, now they are getting ridiculous, for example they will find ways to charge for just about everything from a little excess weight on a luggage to selling seats at the gate.  On a recent trip and while waiting for my flight from Charlotte to FLL, the US Air employee assigned to my gate announced multiple times that for an additional $120 there are two seats available on first class, I really thought this was tacky, why couldn't they upgrade someone from coach to first class for free.   Secondly, the food choices in first class have been reduced to a mere chips and drinks and that's about it.  Lastly, by April of 2014, they are somehow downgrading those that have preferred status such as myself, one customer service person told me, you can always buy up!  Really US Air!"
0,"Wow!  East Ohio Street can be a weird place with an eclectic array of individuals. Including a Pawn shop, drunks, criminals, seedy bars, and all the riff raff .  Troublesome location for a Bistro.  To add to the weirdness, all of their food is pre- made and displayed and served and nuked when you order.  Like gourmet cafeteria food on the fly... if you can picture that. They use a lot of gravy on everything assuming to hide the taste.\n\nOn a few occasions,  I heard what would appear to be the owner yelling at the workers it made me feel uncomfortable so I just walked out. \nNo one should be subjected to that kind of scrutiny. That wasn't the first time I heard dissention behind the counter either.  Because of the owner's dramatic behavior they have a rather dysfunctional crew. They moan when you walk in. Customer service is eliminated by the overall vibe.  In full,  if you like overpriced bland cafeteria style food, & an unhappy lot serving it to you... I'd say this is Pittsburgh's best bet. Highly Not Recommended!!!!!!!!!"
0,"I will say that I am kind of a cupcake snob , as I live downtown Chicago and am surrounded by amazing places. However, I thought that this place would be decent because of its location.   I specifically asked if they made the cupcakes in house and if they were fresh.  Cupcake places in my neighborhood are not sold unless baked fresh that same day. Now like I said, I was not expecting that, but I was told they were baked late the night before. My cupcake tasted at least two days old. There was no moistness what so ever and. It was actually hard in many sections. If I wanted two day old cupcakes, I would have just went to the grocery store and purchased an entire cartoon for the 4 dollars I paid for one disgusting red velvet cupcake.   I pay 3.25 for fresh, homemade cupcakes in downtown Chicago. Joke."
1,"If there's something that I cannot find at any other supercenter, Target usually has it. This store is nice because it's clean, and still yet goes a bit unnoticed by people. It has a Starbucks and a food center, like all usually do. Their clothes section is also pretty great too, although a bit pricey. People are right when they say come to Target for more quality!"
1,"Ce n'est pas un resto fancy, par contre c'est tres honnete. Rapport qualite/prix je suis satisfaite. Depuis les dernieres annees ils ont change souvent de proprietaires, le menu et la qualit\u00e9 a un peu varie aussi. Ca reste un bon choix pour un bon dejeuner pas cher avant d'aller faire le march\u00e9. Le caf\u00e9 est bon et on vous en resert a volont\u00e9. Les crepes sont particulierement bonnes et la sauce au chocolat est delicieuse, les fruits sont frais!"
0,I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal.
0,"On our way to Sedona, my bf and I decided on making a stop by the Heart Attack Grill. We were intrigued by this restaurant since it was featured on the Foodnetwork and the Travel Channel. Also, we're not in AZ often so we decided to check it out.\n\nThe restaurant itself is located in a dying strip mall. The signage outside does not stand out at all so if you're not keeping an eye out for it you may miss it.\n\nWhen you walk in the door, you're greeted by the smell of lard and cheerful waitresses dressed in nurses outfits. I was a little grossed out by lard smell but it was barely noticeable after a while. Haha.\n\nMy bf and I ordered a single bypass burger and fries. I didn't care to much for the fries. It was bland and soggy so I only had a few from the unlimited fries bar. The burger is delivered to you plainly as a cheeseburger and there's a condiment bar with pickles, jalapenos, onions, etc. LOVED the fresh pickles. It definitely made my burger eating experience more pleasurable. I was 2/3 done with my burger when my bf tells me to not watch the video playing on the screen which shows the cooking process of the burger. What do most people do when you hear something like that? You check it out due to curiosity, right? I wish I hadn't seen it because I completely lost my appetite upon seeing the video. *shudder* I sort of knew and remembered the cooking process from the foodnetwork or travel channel shows but seeing it and actually eating it grossed me out. \n\nI'm glad I tried it but I doubt I'd be coming back again if I'm in the Arizona area. I value my arteries a little too much to subject it to such grease/lard again."
1,"Las Palmas is the platonic ideal of the ultimate mexican taco stand.  I'm normally not even a taco fan, but they take it to a completely different level, every savory bite is a transformative flavor experience.  Here is Las Palmas by the numbers:\n\n1 other mexican restaurant's all-mexican staff that told me Las Palmas is where THEY all go out to eat\n\n2 dollars is the price of each taco.  Each taco is actually wrapped with 2 hand made soft taco tortillas and have a double portion of meat (potato salad is an option for vegetarians), so it's more like 1 dollar per standard size taco.  Gourmet, fresh, delicious mexican at cheaper than taco bell prices!\n\n4 is how many tacos I ate.  I ordered 2, left, ate them, and immediately returned to buy more to go to bring home for dinner that night!\n\n10 is how many different fresh toppings they have, guacamole, peppers, limes, cilantro, onions and a variety of salsas from mild to absolutely DEADLY hot habaneros!\n\n7 is how many days a week I'd happily eat Las Palmas tacos!"
0,"Never had a worse experience at a Cafe Rio ever and I've been eating there for over 10 years. Walked in at 5:50 and didn't get my food until 6:27 and there were FIVE people in front of me in line. Staff was openly complaining about having to work on Halloween, picking up stuff off the ground with same gloves as handling food, ran out of all kinds of food by 6:30, kept burning things, food was scattered all over the place. They even let people come in the door about 6:15 and then told them at 6:30 they were closed. Whoever owns this one should never be allowed to own another one!"
1,"i love filiberto's. as a hispanic American i think the good is pretty authentic for a chain restaurant. the only thing different locations vary in quality of food. this one is always busy which in my experience means the food will not be old, cold or overcooked. the only problem i've had with this location is that sometimes you can wait for a long (sometimes really long) time for your food. if you are in a hurry be aware of that..."
0,Saturday night. Opening weekend of Spring Training. 1 chef. Long waits between food delivery. \n\nAyce is limited in variety unless you really like California rolls. There are 5-6 different ones.
1,"I've had my garage door serviced last year by Dreikosen Garage Door and although I did not have any bad experiences, they did not repair the garage quite well.  Hence, I called Travis from HNS Garage. He fixed the garage on the day I've called and took the time to do extra work and services.  \n\nVery professional and great service.  I would definitely use HNS for a garage repair again, NOT Dreikosens."
0,"I am so confused. Rave reviews for this place...how is this possible? The food is decent...i have had far better in less pretty places. The service is strange. We were sat before another couple who came in before us. When I asked for a bar menu, I was looked at with disdain and told they have liquor. The busboy tried to take my plate as I was still eating our appetizer. We had to ask 4 different people to get serving spoons. They serve curry in a GIANT bowl...I do not know why anyone looked so shocked we would ask for a spoon. We got 4 different spoons, ranging from ladel to sugar spoon.There was a whopping 4 shrimp in pur phucket shrimp and the veggies in the curry were closer to raw than cooked. The flavor in the phucket shrimp was salt and more salt. Our pork appetizer came with a dipping sauce of....Siracha. That is it. A bowl of Siracha. The meat was not tender and hard to eat. Maybe because this is Peoria, people do not have a clue? You would be better served at the very unglamorous Line Thai down the street. I won't come back. Even if it is free."
0,"I was not impressed with this place. The service was not very fast and the wings were not tasty at all. The sauces, even though I went with the Caribbean jerk, tasted very much like Buffalo sauce. They have a million sauces...well not really but there's a ton. Consider this strictly a carry out or delivery place. You do not want to dine in here.\n\nI also was not a fan on how they price their wings. You order by the pound...who does that? I don't know how many wings are in a pound. Normal places usually price by number of wings. These guys price the same as Buffalo Wild Wings but are no where near the quality.\n\nI guess if you're smoozing for some bar time food, this will work if you're drunk. On the plus side, they deliver too. Overall, I probably won't be going back."

0,"This is the worst KFC I have ever been to. It is the closest one to my house, so sometimes I come here to satisfy my chicken craving. But I try to avoid it at all costs. There have been several incidences where I've had to wait 10+ minutes for my food at the drive-thru. That is completely unacceptable for a fast food joint. The first time it happened, I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was particularly busy that day. But it happened again, then again, then again... They have also cut down their menu tremendously. I used to be a big fan of their Honey BBQ wings. Now they don't even offer any sauces for their wings. This place is not worth your time."
0,Service 8/10\n- out server was very attentive ^_^\n\nPapaya salad 6/10\n- it was big and good just not spicy enough(yes we even asked for it to be spicier) \nChao Tom 4/10\n- very bland but big \nBun rieu 3/10\n- this is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes but I've had better. It's really not great in taste it has more eggs then anything. And wayyyy to much fried onion. Broth didn't taste like it is suppose for bun rieu broth.
0,For a so called high end joint   I have had better nachos at 7-11    The cheese was some processed goo and the chips were so tiny the couldnt anything     I had one of their signature cocktails and it was horrible   Could be that the bartender admitted she didnt drink liquor or that she was following a menu to make it   Would not return even if i stayed at the hotel again    Hope you arr luckier than me if you brave it
1,I have also had my eyelash extensions done here an  couldn't be happier! I get so many compliments on how beautiful and real that they look:)
1,I had a delious chicken filly deluxe sub. Everything is freshly made. The chicken is grilled and very tender and not dried out.
0,"Had not been to this place in quite a while, but decided to try it again recently, after they had reopened. Not so impressed. \nI'm not sure why, maybe because it is always pretty empty, but I always get weird vibes from this place. Feels a little ghost town-ish to me. That being said, I had quite a few other issues with Xtapa Joes. The service was not too great. The restaurant was not as all busy, but our server was nowhere to be found during most of our time there. \nAlso the food is WAY overpriced. I used to get a fried bean burro type thing before they revamped the place, but whatever that was, it was not on the menu anymore. Last time I went I got a spinach salad, and it cost $10, it was something I could have made at home, very lackluster. I got a skinny pomegranate margarita that was good though, a little strong, but yummy. \nI would go back for a drink and some chips (not a fan of the salsa), but have no plans of going back for a meal.\n\nUPDATE: As of 7/31/14, they are closed. Drove past and saw they had everything closed off."
1,Sublime. Amazing range of beers and hotdogs to die for. I never thought  I'd enjoy a night out at the top end of Lothian Road but it's all going to change from here on in.  Staff were lovely and more than happy to give tasters of the various brews on offer. Has a very laid back vibe and the hours just flew by.
1,"The affogato lived up to the hype. I got mine with hazelnut and caramel gelato, and it worked nicely against the bitterness of the espresso. It was around $6 for the affogato, so not bad when considering the place was inside the Palazzo. There are a ton of different gelato flavors, especially fruit-based ones, if you aren't into coffee."
1,I love this firehouse!! Friendly staff and delicious food! Very clean too. I got the turkey bacon ranch sub...sooo good! Make sure to try some of their house sauce with your sub!  Delish!
0,"After reading the bad reviews, I was really hoping they were wrong.  Unfortunately they weren't.  DH & I came here on a Saturday afternoon after we did some shopping in the strip.  The place has a nice interior, but was completely empty.  The service was good, prompt and friendly.  Although it would be hard to imagine it could be bad since we were one out of 3 other patrons there.\n\nI started my meal off with the  Arugula salad - arugula, roasted peppers, balsamic vinaigrette, Gorgonzola.  It was good, and tasted fresh.  It wasn't huge though, although I expected that since the price tag was $3.  DH got Cavatelli  with house made pasta, roasted carrot, eggplant, squash puree.  The pasta was totally overcooked and lacked any good flavor, although it looked tasty.  I ordered the Riccolina - fede pasta, caramelized mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano.  The fede pasta was just weird.  It was thick and heavy, and didn't take up any of the flavorful broth.  The only thing I liked about this dish was the arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano and the truffle oil/broth.  The mushrooms were odd and definitely didn't taste like they were caramelized.  \n\nI don't think I'll be back here again, very disappointing."
1,"Started with a dirty martini. I like mine with Blue Cheese stuffed olives and Grey Goose. Its only gonna run you $16 a drink! The olives were awesome! haha. Starter i went with the seared ahi tuna... Best tuna I have ever had in my life and I eat tuna everywhere. The Calamari is average at best. I had the new your strip with the butter garlic and for the price... I would have been happier at the keg, quite honestly. The lady friend had the scallops and those were cooked perfect! this place is pricey, i have no problem spending $200 on dinner for two but when its all said and done. I don't feel like the price was justified. I would rather go to city hall."
0,"Your hotel is suppose to be my rock! my stone! yest when I check in and the room I reserved was \""all sold out\"" then surely in these dire ecomonic times you'd upgrade me ... especially at those prices ... whaaat?

1,"I don't normally write reviews about a grocery store, but I had to praise their sushi and the excellent team who makes the rolls!!! I sent my hubby to this store tonight for a sushi run, they have some great rolls and if you don't want to go out this is a great place!!! Well the hubby didn't know exactly what to get so he called me and was rattling off selections etc., well one of thee gentlemen who makes the sushi helped and got on speaker phone with me and the hubby and it took just a few seconds to get what we wanted and all because he went above and beyond to help!!! Just amazing service, whenever I stop by they are always great, but this to me sets them apart by far!"
0,Angels received two stars only because it has a great draft beer selection.  Poor ownership/management decision to have last call @ 10:30 on a Thursday night and crappy acoustics ruin this place.  Downtown Phoenix has been dying to have a place like this.  So extend the hours of operation and install acoustics please!
1,"This place is AWESOME! Great beer and wine selection and the deli has specials.      ( vegetarian and non vegetarian )  to make you drool! YUM! Also with the street under construction, I had my lunch delivered to me by a cute boy on a bike.!! A great  place with an eclectic and friendly staff!"
1,"You basically get three comedians for the price of one. There is an emcee who does a short set, an \""opening act\"" comedian who does a longer set and finally the headliner who does a full set. I saw Graham Elwood who was great and Nick Griffin who was even funnier (and has a FML style of comedy that seemed to work better with those of us in our 20s-30s than with the geezers in the crowd). Of course how good or bad the comedians you see are will make or break the night. \n\nI went on a Tuesday and it was about 1/2 to 2/3 full (but this is Vegas so I assume most of us were there on vacation). We got buy one get one free tickets from a Harrahs coupon book you receive when you sign up for the free Player's Club card. Otherwise tickets are about $30\n\nOne final thing...beware that the drinks at the Improv are about the same size drinks you get from the cocktail waitress in the casino itself...they just charge you $9 for them! So if you are going to gamble at Harrahs before the show you might just want to get a few drinks and save your $$."
1,"I will drive to this Fry's every chance I get!  This is the Grand Daddy of all Fry's stores!  YES!  It's got covered or valet parking, they'll bring your groceries out to you curbside, they'll even get your car washed while you shop!\n\nThe bakery is to die for but unfortunately they make nothing gluten free.  They have whole bars of ready made dinner type items.  The olive bar is massive as are is the sitting area near Starbucks.  Leather and massive yummy chairs.  I jokingly said to my Mom that I might start hanging out there all day with my laptop.  Seriously.  Seriously that nice.\n\nThe whole store has wide aisles, massive choice and excellent customer service.  Gourmet chocolate, why yes.  Organic section?  YES.  A jewelry store, bank and a huge area of home accessories and furniture items.  Clean, well lit, flowers, odd fruits, cooking classes.  That too!"
1,"Try the Miso Sea Bass definitely a plus.  Cocktails are on point.  Staff was great.  Atmosphere was the best.  Don't go if you want a nice intrimate dinner - its Vegas for goodness sakes - be loud and have fun.  Appetizers were all delicious - its a must try restaurant and a most go back again, kinda place."

1,"As the duchess of Sumo Sushi, I'd be doing it a disservice if I didn't post a review. :) \n\nPositives: always delicious. Generous portions. \n\nNegatives: on many occasions I've gotten a roll that was different than what was according to the menu. They hand you two menus: one with pictures and one for AYCE. The rolls on each are listed with different ingredients. You may think you're getting one thing, but you end up getting another. I've mentioned it to them more than once, and the language barrier(?) has gotten me nowhere. \n\nGood luck!"
0,"I'm from out of town and was visiting relatives who lived near this salon. I went there looking for a Shellac Manicure. I've been having CND Shellac Manicures for over a year and I would NEVER recommend that anyone have this manicure done there.\n\nFirst off, they totally buffed my nails with a very coarse buffer. I asked why they were scraping up my nails and they said that the polish holds on better to the nail if it is roughly buffed (my salon at home does not do this, in fact thier CND rep told them not to buff at all), I wish I told them to stop but I let them continue.\n\nAfter returning home and going to my normal salon to take off the polish, my nail salon had the hardest time taking off the polish (even after soaking acetone!). Turns out Highland Nails put on a gel polish base coat like they use when you put on Gel Nails, not the CND base coat. Which explains why they ripped up my nails so the the polish will stay longer. My nails were literally stained red as well. \n\nAlso, they did not use the recommended curing times between coats - they didn't time it at all. They just stick your hands in the UV boxes and let you sit there. So, obviously, they don't really know what they are doing do they care for their client's nail \""health\"". \n\nCombine this with the fact that 3 different people \""tag-teamed\"" my manicure & pedicure....I would tell people spend their money elsewhere, you're paying alot for mani & pedi so go to a salon who knows what they are doing."
0,"the really bad italian restaurant in Scottsdale, The chef is snubbing that he do not allow any people to change the side of the plate because he want you to force to buy extra pasta for $16.00 dollars. Please take care when you order the extra ugly and not flavors pasta it is expensive, the any dessert is over $ 15.00 and the bad Espresso is $ 5.00 dollars, I ate on the best Italian  restaurant in Dubai,London,Germany,Italy.But i never ate crap like this i  do not recommended this restaurant. I prefer Tomaso or Tutti santi by Nina ."

0,Excellent experience and ambience. Had a great time however 3 (out of 4) got very sick (likely food poisoning) the next day. Past experiences have been great and this is the first time this has happened but we got very sick and can only attribute it to our dinner at El Chorro.
0,"Somewhere on the NY NY website I saw a promotion for BOGO breakfast here if you stay at NY NY which we were.  I made a reservation a couple weeks before even though I figured we probably wouldn't need it on a weekday.  We didn't but there was a nice table waiting for us on the Patio.\n\nI ordered the corn beef hash for $10.99.  It came with sliced potatoes and chopped corn beef on top along with two poached eggs, and a fried polenta cake.  Breakfast is also served with warm french bread.\n\nI did not care for the corn beef which was dry.  The potatoes were undercooked and overall the dish was very rich and greasy.  The polenta cake was tasteless and rubbery... I didn't understand the concept of it at all... and the poached eggs were cooked to perfection, the saving grace of my breakfast.  Also, the bread was very good and the real butter was high quality.  I was dissapointed...\n\nMy hub ordered the french toast for $9.99 and said it was pretty good, nothing fancy... but he'll eat anything and I was not interested in trying it.\n\nThe coffee was excellent and refills kept coming, as they should for $4.50 !!!\n\nOur server was nice and started out attentive but ticked me off when he took the order of two tables near us that were seated after us............. my pet peeve for sure.  So of course they got their food before us and that just isn't OK with me.  He didn't neglect us otherwise so that was nice.  And the lady pouring the coffee was on it!  Loved that!\n\nI won't be back for breakfast but based on the pics posted on Yelp I do want to try them for dinner... we shall see..."

1,"This is by far the best go-kart track in Vegas.  Gas powered karts - not electric ones like the other tracks - give you that real racing feel.  They are MUCH faster than the track, so you really have to drive.  You can't just floor it all the way around the course like at the kiddie cart tracks - this place is for adults who want to act like kids for a while, not snot-nosed toddlers.\n\nStaff is always helpful and friendly, track is perfect for all skill levels (not too easy or too difficult) and it's a great bang for your buck.  Just about anytime I have friends or family visiting me in Vegas and they ask to do something non-traditional (i.e. not gamble, get trashed, hit the strip clubs or spend hours throwing food down our throats at a buffet) I take them to Fast-Lap.  Not once has anyone I've taken not been thoroughly impressed and had a great time.  It's a blast - try it!"
1,Southwest is SUPER organized and friendly! They ROCK!
1,"I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.\n\nThis is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience."
1,What a neat surprise. A sunday night soft jazz and good smoked meat food. Casual dining but don't be fooled by the space when u drive by. Do not judge a book by its cover. A small place with out the jazz of bright lights can fool you. Apache junction has surprises with food and entertainment. Come and try it Pat and Dick
0,"Went there this evening with the family.  My wife likes it here and I have never been impressed.  Tonight, by far was the most disappointing.  I ordered a \""double cut\"" pork chop, medium for $17.00 which included a soup and side.  What I received was a \""single cut\"" just one bone 8 oz or so overcooked, dry pork that was deplorable for what they charged for it.\nI could have purchased 3 pork chops for what I paid for this meal.  I complained about the \""value\"" and was told that it was a 10Oz pork chop vefore cooking, I was offered something else, but I decided to cut my losses and just not return.  If they are serving 10 Oz pork chops that's what should go on the menu.  A double cut pork chop is \""double cut\"" defined by 2 bones or a resonable thickness much like what is served at most steakhouses (Mortons, Capital Grille etc)\n\nIt's a shame since they're menu is varied and has a lot of good sounding choices.  They are consistently mediocre and will not get my business anymore."
0,"Trash. The manager is spiteful and rude. Would rather see a table sit empty rather than seat it with a table of girls.

Managment is horrible and would prefer to see an empty restaurant that a table of girls."
1,"When my hubby and I started to plan our trip to Charlotte I looked at options on Restaurant.com and Emzy was one of them.  I was a bit leery of their 3 star rating on here but decided to give it a go, and I am sure glad we did!  We went on a Friday evening and it was a bit empty.  There were a few people at the bar but there were only a couple tables seated.\n\nFor a starter, we ordered the Joyful Dim Sum Platter.  It consisted of 3 different dumplings and they were all equally delicious.  As an entree I decided on the Yakisoba shrimp noodle bowl.  It was full of flavor and there were plenty of shrimp and veggies.  Hubby chose 3 sushi rolls and we finished the entire plate.  Because we were just shy of the minimum dollar requirement for our gift certificate we decided to try their key lime pie.  The crust was a bit soggy but it was still really tasty.\n\nI am so glad we came here for dinner.  The server was very friendly and even suggested we go to the park's opening right around the corner.  If he didn't mention that I don't know what we would have found to do."
1,"If you are looking for a cheap buffet and/or want an introduction to classic American home cooking, then the Garden Court Buffet at the Main Street Station is for you.  The buffet is only $9 for dinner ($8 if you join their player's club) and offers a whole array of American classics, from fried chicken to roast beef and manicotti, to pork shoulder and make-your-own-tacos.  There are also pasta salads, mashed and baked potatoes, green beans, steamed carrots, etc.  The only thing really missing are ribs.  The casino seems attract Filipino/Hawaiians, so there were a few Chinese/Filipino/Hawaiian offerings as well.\n\nWe weren't too hungry so we didn't taste that many dishes, but the manapua (Hawaiian steamed pork buns) were the best I've tasted.  The pork had the perfect combination of acid and sweetness and they kept very well in the steam table.  I wholeheartedly recommend this.  The other winner are the mashed potatoes.  They are perfectly seasoned and taste just of what they are.  The kalua pork was also pretty good, but as the main flavor in this dish is liquid smoke, it's hard to get it wrong.\n\nOther dishes weren't as great.  My daughters enjoyed the \""make your own tacos\"" station and I liked the tortilla chips, but the guacamole needed more avocado.  The fried chicken was crispy, but it tasted like the microwavable kind.  The lumpia and chow mein both needed more seasoning.  My husband liked the pasta salad (or was it potato salad?), but it wasn't cold enough.\n\nThe biggest loser of the day was the mac & cheese  I didn't taste it, but my daughter could barely stomach one bite - and this is not a picky child.  The other loser was the melon, which was unripe and not sweet.\n\nDesserts were the best part.  Their banana cream pie was particularly tasty, but their key lime pie wasn't bad - though too sour.  The cheesecake was great, if a bit sweet.  Everyone's favorite, of course, was the soft-serve station.  There are many other choices, however: from pies to pastries to puddings.\n\nService was great, our waiter refilled our glasses often.\n\nIn all, it was a very pleasant experience."
0,"If I could rate this zero stars I would.  I am 43 years old.  I attended an event for 31-45 year olds.  Not only were there at least 5 men under 30 at the event, I found myself across the table from an 18 year old who had just graduated from high school.  These people did not check IDs and when I approached them about it they were very nonchalent about it and told me there was nothing they could do ... erm, how about check IDs?  When I suggested that, they said they had been but that people were claiming discrimination and dropping out, so they stopped carding.  Funny, if they were a bar, that wouldn't exactly be legal now would it?  And if you are not willing to prove your age for an event with specific age parameters, what are you hiding??\n\nSo 5 or 6 out of 20 men kind of narrowed down the playing field quite a bit - considering the money I had to pay to attend this event, I found this to be rather unfair and just wrong.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, they matched me with someone I said NO to and gave him my email address, and didn't list one of the men I DID say yes to.\n\nThe entire thing was a fiasco and I will never use their services again."

0,"While visiting my father who was admitted to St. Joseph, I had to get my Americano fix. The first day, I felt like the barista was irritated that I had asked if they had a canister of non-fat milk.\n\nThe second day I had brought a 2nd visit coupon from another location. The offer said $2.00 iced drink after 2PM, which sounded great. The same barista, the one with the mullet, was quick to point out the fine print \""Participating Locations Only\"" with a nasty attitude. When I told him that I didn't feel right buying full priced Starbucks drinks twice in a day, he rolled his eyes and said \""Oh well, YOUR LOSS!\""\n\nSo today, I made every effort to get my coffee elsewhere. I usually look for the non-corporate coffee shop, however, in this neighborhood it seems like the only options for quick espresso drinks in this area the Starbucks peppered all over the downtown area.\n\nThe staff here made me really appreciate the Starbucks by my house as well as all of those small independently owned shops that I really enjoy so much more.\nIf you must get your Starbucks and you are going to the St. Joe's, GET IT ON THE WAY, NOT HERE!"
1,"My fiancee and I only have 3 nights in Montreal and one of the things on her must get list was Poutine. Well it was between this place and Resto La Banquise, and this spot won the coin toss.  \n\nAs spoken by other yelpers, let me re-iterate some key points. The menu is quite possibly one of the most colorful hand made works of art that doubles as a menu. The interior is similarly decorated as well.  You would never think that a place like this existed in such a location, but drive through a residential part of town, and then boom, there it is just sitting on the corner.  Server was friendly and offered us a selection of their beers on tap and information on what they had for the evening. Eventually my fiancee settled on being a traditionalist with the standard grand Regulaire, while I went the man route and got the  grand Bourguignonne, although I had them leave out the mushrooms. Pics were taken of both dishes and just staring at these took a year off our lives.\n\nMine could best be described as meat on a plate with starch under it.  The gravy was excellent and seasoning of the beef was tasty. Since I am not Canadian, I cannot say whether the cheese \""squeaked\"" or not so I deferred to my fiancee who says \""It didn't squeak but it was still fresh\"" you purists apparently will understand that..\n\nShe enjoyed her traditional poutine, however felt that the fries could have been a little less greasy, more cheese on the plate, and that the gravy was perfect. Definitely one of her top 3 poutines shes had so far to date."
0,"The price was fair and the atmosphere is well...interesting. That is about all I can say. The sushi was terrible! If you like fried rolls with cream cheese and random other bits shoved in with overpowering sauce, then this is the place for you!  However, if you crave fresh finely cut pieces of fish, go somewhere else. \nI got a roll in which there was chewy connective tissue still attached! What kind of half cocked \""sushi\"" places allows that to happen. \nTo leave on a positive note, the service was quick."

I mean, we were in jeans and t-shirts, but didn't look like bums.  The food was terrible too.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find.  They claim their pasta is homemade and \""al dente\"", but really it was just undercooked.  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard, or sticking together.  I doubt we'll ever come back."
0,"I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff. \n\nMy dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am. \nWe got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building. \nMy dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!! \nWhy would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!? \n\nI had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue. \nWe got to emergency and she died less then an hour later. \n\nThanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in..."
0,"They used to have buy one get one 1/2 off coupons, which was the only reason we ever ate there but when they stopped accepting them we stopped ordering. I would never pay full price for this mediocre at best food. I don't believe the chicken is white meat, after ordering the Mongolian chicken and finding several chewy pieces. If you order breaded/friend chicken meals, they are usually more breading than chicken. They egg rolls are mushy and the crab puffs are so so. The egg drop soup is terrible and smells like wet dog, I wouldn't even taste it! It's average at best."
0,Another disappointment from Squirrel pizza...
0,"They once were good...not any more. Charged me $17 to do a full wash and interior dressing. They did a half a$$ed job, never put the interior dressing on, left my antenna on through the wash and lost my cupholder ashtray. They must be too cheap to run the A/C in the waiting room, it was hotter in there than it was outside. Lousy place, poor service. Pass them by."
0,"Perhaps certain places don't deserve the lowest rating because the person doing the reviewing is not a good fit for that particular kind of place, and so, cannot review it accurately. Because of this, I gave this place an extra star just in case I am biased against these types of places.\n\nNow I will paint humanity with a wide brush and put us all into two camps: \n\n1) Those who would rather play with a dog outside on the lawn on a nice warm afternoon.\n\n2) Those of us who would rather slip outside the backdoor of a rock club in Berlin to snort a quick line.\n\nLet me just say that in my camp we have no use for, nor desire to ever return to, this Outback Steakhouse type of establishment.\n\nWhat I truly think about this place is not suitable for public utterance, but I will go so far as to say the food was dull, the drinks were mixed as if they were for a teething child and not a grown man, and the atmosphere looked as if the decorator was commissioned from the school of bathroom design.\n\nIf you died and went to this place, you would not be in hell, but you would not be very happy."
1,"Short version: The Blue Man show is a funny and entertaining. It's hard not to like.\n\nLong version: Three human like creatures explore what it means to be human through everyday items. The creatures explore simple subjects such as color, sound and movement; all while touching on more complex subjects such a learned behavior and the definition of art. The shows flow relies heavily on the rhythm of drums. The drums have a primal effect on the creatures, think Burning-Man, which becomes more and more complicated as they explore each others personality. \n\nThe three creatures interact with their audience and maintain a casual atmosphere. Seats close to the stage require rain coats (they are provided). Please don't show-up late, you will be identified and tormented... just a little bit. I enjoyed the show very much and recommend it to others. Many on-line offered are available and you shouldn't pay more than $60 for good seats. Enjoy. \n\nBased on 7/2010 visit."
1,"They always have something interesting there.  I have found several great pots and pans and other cooking things.  They also have a good selection of cookbooks.  They also often have cheaper prices than Amazon!  Every time I go they have new things.  One thing, I bought earbuds that did not live very long before they came apart."
1,"Hotshotvegas.com is an incredible resource for locals. Anytime I need a weekend \""away\"" or just want to have a fun night on the strip and not drive home - I call Jason.  Hot Shot Vegas always gets me amazing rooms at a super discounted price. Tons of incentives, great customer service and I NEVER have to wait for an answer to my questions.  \n\nHot Shot Vegas is also perfect for when friends are in town visiting and want to go party. I Just send them to HSV and they always have a blast.\n\nHIGHLY recommend this company. Super fun people. Super fast service."
1,"The decor alone draws you in with an expansive bar and lounge area to relax before settling in for dinner.  Attentive staff looked after our preferences and a Super Tuscan paired well with the veal special.  The house salad is nicely imaginative and a nice digression from \""Caesar\"".  Too often, high-end Las Vegas restaurants take advantage of guests with indifferent service and neglectful kitchen preparation.  I'm pleased to report that Panevino is a delightful exception and apparently cares greatly about its customers.  We're headed back soon for a group dinner at the chef's table."
0,"High expectations only met with the sticky toffee pudding cake and coffee press with chocolate spoons. The filet was 'okay', the fish and chips had skin on the fish along with French fries. Strange Gordon dish.  The macaroni and cheese was good. We had fabulous a great time with our friends but the meal did not meet our expectations."
1,"I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\n\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."
1,"Needed a new blank transponder key (bought at ikeyless.com) to be cut and matched to the mrs. car. Getting through to the service department was a challenge, but when I did get through and talked to  Mike Santana I was able to set up a early morning appt.\n\nMike's professionalism and willingness to make sure I had a good experience here were top notch\n\nTook care of the key and also had the techs perform a courtesy check that I asked for.  Did not hard sell the scheduled maintenance that was needed.\n\nThanks Mike!"
0,"go to another one, lines are super long, we were like 10 deep during lunchtime & only 2 cashiers. one of which was dealing with an exchange. then the other lady, figured she needed to go help someone, and left her register. I wanted to kick her.\n\nasked another employee where something was, without acknowledging me, smiling, nor looking up he told me where it was like I was bothering him....\n\nthere's a reason this one is the lowest rated out of the others in town. I was praying for a customer survey on  my receipt."
1,"Yum, I love this place. Great sack lunch special. The bug juice is delicious! The fresh baked bread is soooo good. The current staff can sometimes be dickholes but I am still gonna give them 5 stars cuz it's all about the food!"
1,"My favorite late night sushi restaurant. As long as you're having a good time and of course ordering food and drinks they will stay open. Usually close about 4 am, it's also a great meeting spot before hitting the strip. The vegas roll is my favorite!"
1,We checked this place out after seeing it on the Food Network and it was delicious. The rosemary potatoes are top notch and the strawberry jam would be great on almost anything.
0,"This is one of those places, where you give a one star rating, because Yelp forces you to give that at a minimum. My husband and I were on vacation this past week and we wanted to try out some local Arizona wineries. We didn't have an Arizona wine map with us, but our GPS could find some for us. This one happened to be in the direction we were headed, and only 10 minutes out of the way. Great! .... WRONG! They advertise themselves to be a winery and bistro. When we walk in, really all it is, is a restaurant that has wine that you can taste. We go up to the bar to sit, since that is where the wines are kept. The rest is all dining room seating, so we figure this is the easiest route to go, to get a tasting, since we were not there for a meal. We walk up to the bar and sit down and are each handed a sheet, which lists out all of the wines available. Only one-third are Kokopelli wines. The rest are from other vineyards, some were also from New Mexico. Okay... well, we pick some, six each to give the place a fair shot. The lady serving us, poured out the wines. The first in a wine glass and the rest in little shot glasses. We were instructed to follow our sheets, since she poured them down the list, in the order that we picked them. And she walked off. We were shocked to say the least. We are used to when a place tells you it is a winery, with tastings, that this is what they do. We received NO information on any of the wines, she didn't even stick around while we did this. And it's not as if it were a busy time of day, and she was helping other people. There were four waitresses, one other couple at the bar (who got there about 10 minutes after us) and three different sets of people at the tables in the dining room. The wines are very mediocre, we actually liked the New Mexican wines better. Oh, also we got a cheese plate, which tasted like one of the packaged one you get from the store and it sits in the fridge until you open it. Nothing fresh. And also they serve you bread. A HUGE loaf, when only about a third of it is necessary. The bread was okay... I think that it may have been better if it had not been served with a PEPPERY BUTTER. Needless to say, this place is definitely not recommended."
1,Beer selection was great including both draft and bottle favorites of mine DVD new ones to try also. Location is close to lots if other attractions. Very walkable neighborhood. Friendly knowledgeable staff. Had live music also on my Friday night visit.
1,"This is probably the best restaurant to go to in Vegas. I went here with my sister for lunch and it was awesome! I'm very much into a place with a great atmosphere so this was perfect. The view was the best money can buy and we sat right next to the window. You can see the whole strip -as you should- since you are high above it and the windows were endless with high ceilings. The service was as if we had our own personal butler and the food was very delicious. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and we shared 2 entrees: a steak and a salad. Both were amazing! My sister took care of the bill so I'm not sure how steep it was, but it's Vegas...you're supposed to spend money!"
0,"Nothing really impressive about this place.\n\nI've tried the pizza, which I suppose wasn't terrible, but definitely not something I'd recommend. They do the fully cooked but pre-prepared pizzas, and re-heat for a minute in the oven. There are places that can do this right, like NYPD, but these guys didn't really deliver a high quality slice.\n\nToday I went with the chicken parmesan, which included a garlic knot and baked ziti. The pasta was pretty bland, and the meat didn't have much substance to it. The garlic knot was decent, but not good enough to turn the meal around."
0,"I have high expectation since the chain is famous in Asia.\n\nYes, the property is very pretty same as the suite.  Yes no casino and night club make it very quiet and easy to walk around.  But this is all you can get from MO!\n\nService is the biggest disappointment there:\n\nReservation\n- I made the reservation online and from the suite description i was told Nespress machine will be in the room.  I was so excited for days cos this is very rare.   However i was told NO machine after i confirm with reservation via email. How can a hotel encourage customer to book online while offering inaccurate room & suite info??  After i talked to front desk, reservation and concierge,  front desk & concierge placed special request while reservation guaranteed me the coffee machine upon check in.  They kept passing me around to different department and seems no one can give me a firm answer for the issue originally caused by them!!  \n\n-FYI, the website isn't corrected yet for the Nespresso machine. It still shows all the suites will have the machine in room. I talked to them about this more than a month ago, how long does it take to take thing off from the website?\n\nFront desk\n-Check in was slow.  We understand early check in wasn't guaranteed.  However, i was told a category up suite was available NOW for $40 more per night.  I immediately agreed to it and hope we can get to our suit right away after a super long day.  Wrong!! Their `available now' means we had to wait full 3 hours cos it needed to be cleaned and checked by housekeeping manager.   I had no where to go to kill that 3 hours after breakfast in MO zen bistro.  Sitting by the pool wasn't an option cos i was so exhausted and all i needed was a bed.\n\n-Checkout was better but beware of billing error.  I was told the upgrade was $40 more per night and we signed up a buy 2 night got 3rd night free.  This  means we should pay nothing for the 3rd night except resort fees.  However, the hotel tried to charge me $40 + tax for 3rd night telling me this is upgrade not room rate blah blah.   Well $40 is ok but think about if `upgrade fee's is $150 from room to suite...I am glad they waive it finally but wonder why .\n\n-The hotel offers complimentary car service from the hotel to anywhere on the strip.  However, front desk didn't mention it and no one told us about their hours.  \n\nConcierge\n-They should be the easiest to talk to.  Wrong, they can't guarantee the coffee machines they inaccurately put on their website.  Half of the menu from their restaurants cannot be downloaded online and concierge forgot the attachments when i requested via emails.\n\n-my husband was interested in exotic car racing and called Concierge for preferred vendors and pricing if available.  It took them 2 hours to call us back saying NO for both.\n\nHousekeeping/Luggage delivery\n-Guest what ? After my long fighting for the Nepresso machine, I still didn't see it when we got to our  suite.  The champagne we brought in from the limo went missing.  We had to call housekeeping a few times to hunt all these things down.  What a hassle after such a long wait for room?\n\n-Some of our toiletries/ice bucket never got re-stocked or refilled during our stay.  We tried to push the valet button but no one bother to respond.  Seems we can only get service unless we call.  Then why bother to have valet button and closet ??\n\n-After 3 hours of waiting and being told the room was checked by manager, the curtain still didn't work.  They sent someone to fix it quick...but come on we were there for honeymoon, why did i get so busy to get them do things rather than enjoying ourselves?\n\n-During out check out, I told the front desk that a limo would pick us up at the hotel entrance by particular time.  However, they didn't bother to send our luggage down to bell desk to get it ready to upload when limo showed up...We ended up waiting for them in the car to let them  figure out where the heck our luggage were.  Thank god that we were not in time crunch to get to the airport..\n\n-Whenever i call from the room, i was seldom addressed by my name.  This is not something picky or demanding for a 5 stars hotel.\n\nSwimming Pool/Fitness Center\n-Machines at the fitness center look nice only but very hard to use especially for interval training.  The touch screen is very annoying.\n\n-The pool is the smallest compared with same level hotels on the strip.  Good thing is almost kid-free and not packed at all\n\n-The service at Poolside cafe sucks, the attendants never offered me any menu or bother to follow up if i needed any beverages or food.    \n\nFor our entire 3 days stay, we were getting very tired to push the hotel staff to get things done. i can only recommend Spa, Tea Lounge and car service. there\n\nOverall,  if you just need a room in central location on the strip, go for it.  If you want some customer service or go for special occasion, stay with Wynn/Encore,  otherwise all your energy will be sucked in to get things in a reasonable wa"
0,"According to some Hallmark card, somewhere 'Life is so precious,/And each day is a gift./So enjoy every minute,/As it were your last to live.' So imagine my disgruntlement to find 25 of those precious, precious minutes frittered away, gone, never to be seen again, while waiting for my (very late) prebooked taxi.\n\n\n Just think what I could have been doing with those beautiful minutes! Dancing, playing chess, smelling flowers! All I actually wanted to do with those minutes, though, was to get to work - hence the reason I booked a taxi. At a mere 15 minutes late I called to ask if it would be much longer:\n\n\n Taxi person - 'It's one minute away, just around the corner'.\n\n\n Me - 'Can you tell me why it's so late? Of course it's not your fault, but I'm now late for work, and I did prebook it earlier this morning, for 15 minutes ago'.\n\n\n Taxi person - 'People are taking their children to school!...' - Now, I had been labouring under the false illusion that people had been taking children to school for quite some time now (decades, even) and yet the world of taxi punctuality somehow managed to keep on turning, but clearly I stand corrected - '...and anyway, people who booked their taxis days ago are still waiting!'\n\n\n Interesting defense. Anyway, time passed. Another phone call, different taxi person:\n\n\n Different taxi person - 'Please hold'.\n\n\n Three minutes pass.\n\n\n Different taxi person - 'It's at least 10 minutes away, stuck in traffic. I'm very sorry'.\n\n\n Me - 'I appreciate the apology, but it's okay, I'll just cancel the taxi'.\n\n\n Different taxi person was nice, I liked her. And as I walked to to the bus stop, I contemplated Ida Scott Taylor: 'Do not look back and grieve over the past, for it is gone'."
1,We had such an amazing photographer.  He was very professional and made our whole wedding experience fun! The pictures are absolutely beautiful!!!  I would highly recommend using Imagine Studios.
0,Waste of time.  They don't have high end items they advertise at low cost but have cheap stuff at a high price. Better off with Amazon or Best Buy.
1,"Hands down the best Chinese restaurant in town! 5 stars ranking it amongst Chinese Restaurants here in town. 4 stars just comparing it to all other restaurants in town.\n\nThere are actually two menus at China Mama. One of them has more traditional and authentic foods, the other has more commercialized and Americanized foods. Both are great. For those used to solely Americanized Chinese food, it's a great way to branch out and order one or two more authentic dishes. \n\nEverything is well seasoned and all the meat is well prepared.\n\nPretty good customer service and they don't do any of the nonsensical \""we charge per soda can\"" on drinks. Food also comes pretty quickly. \n\nDefinitely the place to go if you're looking for Chinese food in town."
0,"This is what I sent to the corporate office I was so upset.  3 days later they sent me an apology and going to let the store manager know and that was it. \n\nNo one cares and customers don't matter\nHere's my email.\n\nI just had one of the worst experiences in a Mens Wearhouse ever and thats why I'm sending an email. This has frustrated me all of yesterday and still is.\n\nI moved to Las Vegas from Missouri.  Shopped at your Springfield store many times for years and have bought many slacks, shirts, suits and walked away very happy.  I'm in sales and I know what keeping a customer means to me. \n\n  Yesterday I  went to Store No. 2401  1159 E Twain Las Vegas.  My wife and I went in for slacks and shirts for my work.  We were greeted by  a gentleman named Marcus, who was a very helpful guy.  He took me to the area of slacks.   I explained what i was looking for and he shared with me the great sale going on.   Talked up the sales sign where it clearly states if I buy 3 pairs of slacks they would be $45 a piece.  Great lets get started.    I picked out a few shirts as well.   I was trying many slacks and shirts on.  Finally finding the perfect set of 3. Trying everything on and getting fitted for a HOUR and 1/2 wore me out but I thought it was going to be worth it in the end.\n\nI was so wrong.  I went to checkout and then this is where it got insulting and made me upset.\n I guess that 2 of the slacks were not the sale price but a different slack and were $90 a piece.\nSo a manager named Joyce came over and said \""if you noticed the price and see that these slacks are better quality slack theres no way we can sell them for $45 and I would get fired if I did\""  Again Im in sales and I've been trained to pick up verbiage and tone in voices.  The way she came across was very insulting.  I was freaking fuming.  Here I am on my day off which my wife had planned out the whole day for us and I talked her into going to Mens Wearhouse for just a few minutes.   \n\nHere's my problem     The time I took trying many shirts and slacks on and getting the slacks fitted.  Thinking that I would be walking out the door with 3 pairs of slacks and the 3 shirts.  The way it was handled was HORRIBLE, the way i was talked down to  because i wasn't buying the better quality of slacks.  I couldn't tell difference in slacks.   Thats not my job to know these things.  IT'S YOURS!!!  ITS NOT MY FAULT.     If I took a client and had him spend an hour and a 1/2 with my product and I bragged about the wonderful sale and the deal he was getting and when it was time to ring up the order I told him sorry YOU CAN'T have it.  Holy crap.    If that mistake was made, I would have honored the deal knowing that he will be back for years to come.  Lose a little, but gain a lot.  The biggest part of sales business is Word Of Mouth.  I work with 63 salesmen (MEN)  Do  you realize that business and the competition  there is in Las Vegas?  Not only have you lost me as a repeat costumer but a chance for referral business.  I'm going to give my opinions about TMW when I get back to work.      \n\nThe point is not about me paying $90 each for the 2 slacks, I went ahead and bought the 3 shirts and one pair of slacks because I didn't want to go drag my wife to another place and have to start the process over again and be even more wore out trying crap on again.  Now I have to do this over again at another time.  I'm pissed about that.   The point is.... i was promised a deal and took the time to get it.  It wasn't delivered.  I was talked down to and insulted.  You guys took something away from me that I thought i was getting.  It was a let down.  You guys should have lost a little to gain a lot.  You would have gained way more than a loss of probably a measly $100 for you.  It's not acceptable. \n\nSincerely, one lost customer that does't know the difference between the quality of the 2 sale slacks.\n\np.s. i never left the fitting room and never took a pair of slacks off the rack off the rack, the 7 slacks that I tried on were brought to me."
1,"When I woke up today, I was hungry and craving tacos from Tacos El Gordo. It makes me seem like a super fatty, but I don't care. Damn, these are good tacos. Admittedly, I had them for the first time, exactly 13 hours ago. I fell in love with these tacos. Hard and quick. I'm pretty sure I fell in love with it even before I ate. Probably fell in love when I got our of my car, and could already smell the food. \n\nThe adobada tacos were amazing. We also ordered the carne asada fries, bu half carne asada & half adobada. The carne asada had good flavor, but was burnt. I don't know if I would order the carne asada again. \n\nThe line on the right is to order pork, the line on the left is to order everything else. \n\nI'm not a big fan of corn tortillas, but Tacos El Gordo has changed my mind about it. Definitely get the pineapple on your tacos. I'm not a big fan of fruit on my food, but i just adds another great element to these tacos. It also has this green sauce on it, of which I am not sure what it is, but it's good. Each taco has plenty of meat, so be prepared to get full. \n\nJust a tip - grab plenty of napkins. As good as the tacos are, it gets very messy when you eat them. Plenty of oil and sauce will be dripping down your hand, and probably down your arm as well - so be sure to roll up your sleeves."
1,One of my favorite weekend lunches when I want to stuff myself for under 10 bucks. I usually get jade red (fried orange chicken with spice) and machaca (shredded beef with spices) or the pollo diablo (not batterred but lightly fried chicken with spices) all the fried rices are about the same the jerk chicken and jerk rice use black pepper as oppossed to chili for the spice. You get a nice doughy cookie as well for about 8.50
0,"Eh. The only reason I'm giving 2 starts and not 1, is for the inside portion of the day club. When it was really hot (and overcrowded) this was a nice alternative. But... $68 for two drinks? Wow. That's a bit much... We ordered a Ciroc peach and sprite and also a Jack and coke. Without even asking us the bartender poured them in their special drais plastic cups. We didn't even drink half, they were too big.\n\nAlso the way the bar is set up is rediculous. There no where to move and the cocktail waitresses have to make their way through the line to get to their tables. I literally saw a tall blonde cocktail server push a patron to get out of her way. This day club did not flow well at all and over all it was not enjoyable at all. I probably will never return."
1,"The best Chinese food in northern Phoenix, and maybe in the entire metro area.  Heck, my wife and I have sampled the Chinese cultural district as well, and in our opinion, the Nee House betters all restaurants there as well.  \n\nThe Nee House has the best General Tso's chicken in the region, with a little twist (I think it's ginger, but i'm not certain) that sets it apart form its competition.  The General Tso's rivals its competition from the west coast and east coast.  The noodles are fantastic, with fresh ingredients and vegetables, and the eggplant and salt-n-pepper shrimp are outstanding.\n\nThe only reason i didn't give The Nee House 5 stars (and I admit, I'm being picky) is because they do not have a dish I've been looking for in the entire Phoenix metro-area, but admittedly the Nee House does not  focus on Sichuan-style dishes (the dish i'm looking for is Sichuan Spicy Cold Chicken Noodles, which i fell in love with while living in the Bay area, but which is impossible to find in the Phoenix-metro area).\n\nIf you want authentic, delicious, Chinese food, make sure you give the Nee House a try."
1,Love the employees here. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Definitely love that they have a drive thru!
1,Great food. Great people. Open late. And they have happy hours and deals on certain things. Foods of all kind. And they change the menu a lot. So you can always find something new to try. Definetly a place for dinner parties and families. They also have a show right in front for the tourists since we r in Las Vegas Baby!!!!
0,"We drove up this morning and were a bit confused to find the cafe closed. Several other people were there staring at the deserted cafe and wondering where the staff was. We had all read this message on the cafe's website:\n\n\""From 6/4 to 6/19 Morning Glory will only be Open on Weekends.\""\n\nWouldn't you think that means they are still open on Thursday June 2nd?  Apparently, they meant to say \""closed weekdays starting 5/30\"", but aren't so good with the English language.\n\nOh well, it's a beautiful farm and almost worth driving out here just for the scenery. Ok, not really. If you are reading this, Morning Glory owners, please learn to communicate your seasonal closing dates  correctly next year."
1,The best reason to pull a Tommy Boy and take 7 years to get your degree.
1,Love it. Everything is delicious and everyone is friendly. Feels like the kind of coffee shop I would come across in a quaint vacation town and wish we had at home (if that makes sense?). Love the kids play area.
0,"It's like the Applebee's of BBQ.  Typical, fairly overpriced, nothing special.  Eat here if you have nowhere else to go :)"
0,"I have long believed that the best way to judge is business is not by what type of clientale they hope for, but the type of customers they actually get.\n\nFor Fibber Macgees, things are not well.\n\nFirst thing I notice us that when I sit down is the bartender fails to notice me because he's busy talking to coeds 10 years his junior in what sounded to be heated debate. He finally makes his way to me and apologizes, saying he \""likes to give girls shit about football.\""\n\nAcross the bar from me I notice a coupe on a a bad date. She is constantly touching her finger talking about what her wedding ring looked like before the divorce, he was staring at her chest.\n\nFinally, the large woman who brought a twilight book to read In the corner alone while eating shepards pie.\n\nThis is the place where sadness goes to die.\n\n\nI give them one star because of their pretty diverse guinness mixed drink menu. But that is all."
0,"After spending 80 bucks per person ($ 20 for express lane) to avoid the 3.5 hr wait, you would think their food or service would be top notch, but NOOOOOO..... They are nothing spectacular to adjust for the money spent..... The lines to get the popular food are long, 15-20 min wait for the meats, have to wait for them to shuck the oysters every time, have to wait for pho because they ran out, have wait for cooked crab legs because they ran out...... wait, wait, wait....... and the kicker is they try to enforce the 2 hour dinning time on us while tables all around us were either empty or not clean up yet. Of the 2+ hrs there, we probably waited another 50 min just to get food, maybe they should worry more about improving their service and food and try to make customers happy... what a rip off..."
0,"Let me start by saying: I LOVE this pizza! \n\nOk, that's where the love stops. \n\nThe service is terrible. Not just terrible, awful even! \n\nYou arrive, you place your order. You enjoy a beer, maybe another. The server comes back to get your order. Wait, I already ordered? You place it again, waiting...waiting. \n\nFinally, after an eternity, a manager comes out: \""she forgot to put your pizza order in.\"" Really? Seriously? After placing it twice? We order again. 40 minutes later, we get a pizza. It's delicious. But, we could have been in Chicago for the time it took to get. And then, at least, we would have been in Chicago. \n\nI \""suppose\"" if you like to complain and feel you want to wait a small eternity for a pizza (that's delicious!) go to Papa Del's. However, if you've had your fill of being treated poorly, find somewhere else!"
1,"I am a huge fan of Lavo. We went on a Sunday night which is supposedly their best night, and had so much fun! A lot of these clubs that we went to were playing this trance crap but not Lavo. Their music was right up our ally. When I'm in a club I like rap music. Give it to me dirty and with heavy beats; I'll be THAT girl on the dance floor throwing her hair around, shaking it like a salt shaker while gettin' low. Awwww yah. \n\nIt's a pretty small venue so if you're looking for something grand, you're much more likely to enjoy XS or Tryst."
0,"The only reason for two stars is bc Katsuya is at the hotel. But even then, the customer service at the SLS of dumb idiots get no stars. No one obtains reliability or accountability these days. Jankiest \""new\"" hotel I have ever been to. Got into my room and the light was out, tv froze plenty of times and they have the lamest \""cable\"" tv. When I checked out, they charged me for mini bar crap that had dust on top of the boxes that I didn't even eat, when I declined room service for my entire stay. And the gnarliest thing was that there were still pubes in my shower. \n\nWhat a bunch of dumb idiots that are running the place."

0,"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday at 11:00am only to discover they don't open until 12:00pm. We went and killed time for an hour until they did open.\n\nGot the menu and discovered they did not have a lunch menu on the weekend so we were forced to order very expensive items from the dinner menu. We then discovered they don't serve Sushi until 4:00pm which is odd for a Sushi Restaurant.\n\nAlso, I asked what a dish was (Katsu Don) as their menu didn't describe it as I am used to eating it and she had no idea what it was and said \""don't order that no one likes it\"". I had to wonder...then why is it on the menu?\n\nShe never came by and refilled our iced tea so we ate half our meal with no drinks.\n\nThe Beef Bulgogi was good and my son said the Teriyaki Chicken was just ok. My wife said the same about her Yakisoba.\n\nWas not impressed for the amount we had to pay to eat lunch. No one else came in the whole time we were there so I don't know why they are charging dinner prices for lunch customers."
0,"This is the 3rd time at Toast and I can definitely say I won't be going back. \n\nHere is the lowdown on my thoughts:\n\nService - 2 stars\nBloody Mary - 1 star (mix is awful)\nChicken wrap- 4stars.... Lots of chicken in that wrap, had service been better to have sauces - it would have been much better \n\nOthers breakfast were rated around 2-3 stars... We were w a group of 6\n\nWouldn't go back, so many other great places"
1,"No complaints. Food and service were both great. This is one of the better Texas Roadhouse's I've been to. If you plan on going the night of a concert, get there early! We were there 2 hours before the concert started and still had to wait."
0,gross. period. went to bellagio buffet years ago when it first opened and remembered it was really good. had not been there since then so hubby and i decided to try it on our recent trip to vegas and totally regretted it. the food looked gross and tasted gross and i'm not even a picky eater! let's just say this is the first time i left a buffet hungry.
0,AVOID this company.  Very slow service.  I would give them 0 stars. If you want to get to the airport on time you're better off taking a cab. Must book return trip a day in advance.  Not refunded for unused return trip (reason was a nonexistent disclaimer).
1,"Don't know where the bad reviews are coming from here. Just ate here again as the DH and I passed through on the way back to L.A. and, while the service is not perfect (it seems as though English is not the first language of most of the people that work here), the service staff were polite and exceptionally attentive. They came quickly to take our order, brought our food promptly, and helped us to pack up our leftovers.  We were even brought tea and watermelon before they took our order! We did have to ask for a refill on our water. but all things considered, that was minor.\n\nThe food was again amazing. This time I had the string beans and spicy eggplant, and both were great, ample portions, well spiced. What more can you ask for? No, this is not Panda Express - if you want that, don't come here. But for authentic, tasty, spicy Hunan-style food, this place can't be beat. Wish they had something like it close to home."
1,I had a chicken bowl. It tasted fresh with guacamole. Daughter is a vegetarian so she tried the veggie bowl and enjoyed it. Checked in for free bark which was bomb. We are gonna fight over the piece.
0,"I know there are quite a few reviews, and I'm not saying go or don't go.  I just can't seem to figure out the big draw of this place.  I was not impressed...at all.  Meh..for sure."
0,"Everytime I pass this place, I tell myself I should give it a try, it looked intresting        Since today I was trying to low carb it I just ordered the chicken, so this review is solely based on the chicken and service . The chicken was so-so, nothing special to me.\n          IMO Costco put out a better tasting product. The chicken did  not look or taste fresh. The server brought out four sauces in squeeze bottles and as she was explaining each sauce she had the bad habit of pointing and touching the tips of the spout, yes where the sauce comes out, gross. At least she did not lick her fingers as she was doing this. I watched her do the finger thing to another table, so I guess it's a habit with her. I skimmed my wife carol's k 's review and noticed she would go back, I guess she dines alone;)"
1,"I went to FEZ for the first time this past weekend. Love the mid-scale urban feel. Both the restaurant and the bar areas are cozy along with a nice outdoor patio. For starters the drinks were mixed to perfection. I ordered the veggie burger with salad and I must say this is the BEST veggie burger in Phoenix and the salad was simple, fresh and dressed with just the right amount of one of the finest house vinaigrettes I ever had. I'm originally from NYC and you might call me a foodie so, I set the bar fairly high and I'm not easily impressed but FEZ has earned my respect and I will be back."
0,"This place is mildly overrated. The furniture is cool, but it's kind of cheap. \n\nThe reason for my review however is about the staff. Not only is it hard to find someone to help, but when we did try a few weeks ago, they told us to hold on and they never came back. Granted they were \""short staffed\"" but if thats the case then just express that to us, instead of leaving and never coming back. Also when we spoke with the Manager in charge he wasn't any further help and even at one point walked away as we were talking to him. I didn't understand why he would have been so rude. Maybe they were having a bad day, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but overall it was a 'whatever' experience. \n\nThe cafe is really good though!"
1,"\""Love This Arena!\""\nI have been to plenty of boxing matches as well as concerts! I'd say the best concert I went and saw here had to be the Mrs. Carter Tour! Beyonce KILLED the stage at the MGM Grand Arena! I I always suggest that if the concert you are going to is here to also stay at the hotel as well! Makes the commute so much more eaiser! The food inside is expensive as you know what though!"
0,"My quest for good gelato on the Las Vegas strip continues. This place isn't cutting it. 5 bucks for a very small cup of so-so gelato.\n\nService is depressing. I'm getting the feeling that people in these jobs just really hate their lives. Hmm let's see, I wait on line at the sign that says order here. Place order. Receive gelato. Proceed to end of counter where the register is at with a sign that says pay here. Then I wait. And wait some more. But wait, there's more! More waiting! Finally the same dud (yes I left the e off the end on purpose) comes over and mumbles that I can go pay at the middle kiosk if I want. I'm sorry I could not understand you; is it because your tongue is too big for your mouth or do you have a really hip tongue piercing in there?  My reply...I'd prefer to just walk out without paying. A quick scan of the ceiling...yep cameras, damn. So I goto the kiosk and guess what? I waited 5 minutes more to pay for this substandard gelato!\n\nFinally I'm on my merry way to the counter between the candy shop and the restaurant to have a sit down with my gelato. Decided to scan my receipt. Wouldn't you know it...a mystery charge titled CNF. Whats CNF you ask? Well here's what they do; they charge you the advertised 5 bucks for the gelato then tack on the mandatory 8.1% sales tax and then take that total and tack on 3.5% more and call it CNF. Yes the tax on food here is now 11.6%!?!?!  Such B.S. just increase your prices 3.5% so everyone knows what they are paying instead of tacking on mystery charges.\n\nBreakdown of your 1 star rating:\n- 1 star for substandard gelato\n- 1 star for bad service \n- 1 star for overpriced rubbish\n- 1 star for mystery fees\n\nOverall Sugar Factory: FAIL\n\nThe quest continues..."
1,"My favorite cupcakes EVER!  Well just the red Velvet!  I love when they put the saguaro's on them I love that, it makes me feel like we they made is especially for me!\n\nEveryone should go and grab a cupcake when they are in the area!  Now all they need is the ATM cupcake machine like that they have in LA."
1,"Verdict... delicious!\n\nI get to pick what gets put in. Just the way I like it. Price range, same as your standard taco joint in every corner of San Diego CA. Hours, 10pm the latest. Man, everyone sleeps early in Maricopa.\n\nThis shop, prices fair. For the amount and taste, you can virtually create any kind of combination there is without breaking a hole in your pocket. All they need now  is a seafood option, and they'll be complete.\n\nThe staff are friendly, just not outgoing unless you initiate the conversation. But then again, there are those who might say \""I am not here to talk, just here to eat\"". For me on the other hand, I wouldn't mind having the staff  be a bit more outgoing.\n\nIn the end, I love this taco shop. It's small and homey. A great place away from home. I missed San Diego even since I moved to AZ, but this taco joint makes their food just like the taco shops in CA, and that to me is... As good as it gets!\n\nThanks Cilantro's. You helped me with my homesickness."
0,"I stopped into Jack Astor's the other night because it was late and the place we were hoping to go to was closed.  I had never heard of it so I didn't know what to expect.  It was a slow weeknight so I was surprised when I walked in to find dance music blasting.  I'm not really sensitive to loud music, but it was annoying to have to shout at my coworkers sitting across from me.  I could see this being acceptable on a packed Friday or Saturday night, but on a weeknight with nobody there it didn't really fit.\n\nThe service and the food were both average.  I ordered the really really big meatball which was one half-pound meatball served on a small pile of spaghetti.  It was okay, but relatively boring.  There wasn't too much on the menu that was appealing, it was mostly typical bar food.  The beer selection was decent.\n\nI'm not really sure what Jack Astor's is trying to be.  They look like a sports bar with their large TVs, but have the feel of a club with their loud dance music.  I typically love sports bars but I wasn't a fan of this place.  I would likely only stop in here again if we get out of work late and it's the only place open."
0,"I had the eggplant dish with vermicelli noodles. Wife had the chow mien.  Both items were greasy and lacking in flavor. Sad, I had high hopes after seeing the reviews. Disclaimer: I am not sure it makes a difference; I am neither vegan or vegetarian."
1,"2nd review... I have been here over 6 times in 2 months and everything is always wonderful. The carne adovada and the tikka masala are literally TO DIE FOR FOR UNDER $10.00\n\nIf you haven't had lunch here you are making a mistake \n\nIf you haven't brought a date here, you are missing out and so is your date.\n\nFix it- go there. Live it, love it, eat it."
0,"This place actually looks exactly like the last bar, but worse with no music. They have some lame video games way in the back - an idea that is already been done multiple times and better. The Derby House has games similar and Gringo Star also does this better. The King is a dark, dingy place with fruit flies prancing around the bar and a depressing crowd of not Scottsdale's finest. Of course, I needed to check any new bar out, but this is clearly not a sports bar with two decades-old TV sets in weird spots around the bar. On this Monday night football game, about ten people were gathered, it was more like a funeral than a lively new hot bar in town. It feels like it has been here forever, yet it is only a month old - welcome to dullsville. Place was so depressing, I had to leave at halftime. Now they did have a $7 Burger and 32oz beer special, but the burger you get for that price (Or the normal $5 price) is poor quality frozen meat. I should have known better. The beer was large and the popcorn was free, but this bartender had little personality. He said they were hiring a female soon, so that will help, but otherwise this joint needs to brighten up the place and liven up or soon it will be checkmate for the King."
1,"I recently moved to the area so this was my first culinary venture in the 'hood. Happy starts at 11:00 am?!?! What a delight!!! \nMy daughter and I each had the Express lunch, 10\"" pizza with half salad. I had the strawberry and goat cheese salad and she had the Caesar. Both were so delicious! \nFor pizza I had the prosciutto and fig pizza which was a lot of fun. I didn't think I would eat the whole thing In one sitting but I did!\nMy daughter had the pepperoni and her only complaint was she thought there were too many pepperonis on her pie. I don't see how that could be a bad thing but some kids are funny that way!\nThey had some other interesting combinations and I'll surely be back to try them all!!!"
0,"Highly unrecommanded. Horrible service. We wish there is a 0 star.  \n\nFood is average, but many items are already gone when we arrived at 12:30pm, including soy milk. Asked for ginger, they say they don't have any; Chinese kitchen without ginger? I don't think so. \nDon't expect any service, not only us upset about it, customers at a neighboring table actually stood up and left after getting some attitute from waiter."
0,"Should be L.I.E. Fitness\n\nI just filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against LA Fitness. The sales person (Harold) straight up LIES about the contact terms to get you to sign. The operations managers are no help. They say they'll call you back and don't. They seem complicit in allowing their sales people to lie, and allowing the collections callers to bully people.  \n\nI moved to 24 Hour Fitness and am so glad. Better/Newer equipment, better classes, and (apparently) no slimy sales guy. \n\n# of BBB complaints in the last 12 months for LA Fitness? = 1170 \n# of BBB complaints in the last 12 months for 24 Hour Fitness? =  261\n\nDON'T GO!\n\nAlso, if you got lied to:\n1. Dispute the charge with your CC company and you'll get your money back and they cannot charge you any more.\n2. File a complain with the BBB\n3. Lastly - take heart that they *DON'T* report to credit agencies (unless the ops manager lied about that, which is possible)\n\nShame on you LA Fitness!"
0,"This is honestly the worst office ive ever been to.they don't greet you when you walk in the door, nor do they explain anything to you in the front.\nI was scheduled for an appointment an I get there an the front office lady tells me that she realized an hour before my apointment that  I need to see a doctor before I get my cleaning but was just in the week before getting work done.they need better communication with there staff an patients. I've worked in the field for many years an never had this problem with any office I've gone into until now.I would never recommend this office to anyone unless they wanted to get treated rudely. they need new front office staff!!! never going back here"
0,"Up side: I'm in love with their blueberry bagels! They are sooo delicious! My girlfriend has me hooked on them! Downside: apparently the blueberry bagels are very popular. Half the time I make the drive there, they are sold out. Why don't they make more of something they always sell out of? They've lost a number of sale opportunities just with my self alone. Service wise, half the staff seem like they don't enjoy their jobs thus giving dull service. They make no eye contact while they are speaking to you and when they do speak its so mono-toned. I feel like they're annoyed that i'm there. So I get my bagels (if they have them) and bolt out."
0,"Cheesy, outdated decor, sky high prices with service that does not match, so so food. Went here on a recommendation and because they have home made gluten free pasta. Sorry we did. Our server was very proud of the fact that he knew we were gluten free and knew how to take care of us. I reminded him again when salads were ordered. Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta. Dirty dishes were not removed in a timely manner nor were water glasses filled. Just an odd, outdated place. Felt like I was back in Jersey, without the good food."
0,"Keeping it short and to the point. Tao was o.k. A friend of mine said she tried 3 times but could nver get in and finally she'd made it in. We were herded around then they finally began to allow us in. The Door man was sweet and took a second to explain the entire layout prior to stamping my wrist.\nWe took a stroll around- food looked good, decor was really nice, adequate number of bars. Unfortuantely every one and his aunt Susy was there that night and how the pushed and they shoved with little utterance of an excuse me. \nThat really put a damper on our moods. Then went up to Tao beach. It was way smaller than I expected. The pools at MGM are like 8 times the size of this area. No room to sit or dance here either so we get ready to head downstairs...oh BUT WAIT THERE IS A LINE- yes A LINE to WAIT in to go back downstairs. Then I noticed each time we moved from a diffrent level the DJs seemed to be playing almost the same song(s).  I had the experience but it was worse than going to A Hollywood club and they didn't have bacon wrapped dogs waiting outside! WTh!"
1,"Inexpensive, Quick Band-aid; I would stay here again.\nIt's a Marriott, so I knew it would be okay.\n\n\nPROS: \nThe only hotel *IN* the Waterfront\nReasonable rates\nVery friendly staff (both on the phone and my in-person experience)\nWas able to give me a room @ 1:30am during the 2010 Pgh Blizzard\nClean room\n\nCONS:\nn/a, none that I could really think of\n\n\nI had to call here @ 1:30am to make a last minute reservation because I was literally stuck in Homestead during the snow storm.  They gave me a great deal on a nice, warm room on a last minute basis.\n\nI couldn't have asked for more (except some pajamas! LOL).\n\nI will def utilize this hotel again if needed."
0,"Purchase a Groupon for this place, excellent price as well. I had a $10 off coupon for any Groupon purchase so the total cost was $10 for $40 worth of food. Took a group of coworkers to lunch on a Thursday. Place was empty it was seat your self, no wait staff was present except the bar tender. He appeared to be the only one waiting tables and running the bar, everyone in the party agree'ed to give them 10 minutes to come to the table for our order before walking out. It took them about 6-7. Service wasn't bad apologized for the wait, etc. i've had worse but there just could of been more staff on hand. The food was decent nothing i'd go back for but everyone agree'd it was ok just your typically bar food with a twist. The biggest complaint was the slow service and lack there of. I'd say its worth a try if you have a deal like a Groupon but other then that i'd skip it and find a place were you get service without a long wait."

0,"Is it possible to give no stars?\n\nI booked this hotel for two people from work going to a conference.  I knew it would not be fancy but this is the email I received:\n\n\""Also, the room they put us in was seriously disgusting - like we would really not have been able to take a shower the whole time we were here, the furniture was dirty, we were wary to touch the beds, definitely could not have taken our shoes off and touched the carpet...you get the point. \""\n\n...Seriously embarrassing for me, my company and the host of the conference."
0,"So I came in to the store to evaluate my options since my contract was up. I hate this hip Apple-store-rip-off where the music is pumping and you need 3000 square feet for 15 products. You always have to wait too. Not a little, but quite a bit.. so when they finally get to you, you are invested in the motion of purchasing since you have spent time here looking at 200 silicon cases for iPhones.. only iPhones. \n\nSo this slick walks up in his neon sneakers, flat bill hat and think he is super fly even though he is the one working on a Saturday. He is trying to promote Verizon so hard that he is shooting off buzz words like Verizon 4G Chip set - even though I can tell he does not know what a chip set is, nor could he explain what the difference between 3G and 4G is. I know what it is, and I don't expect that this clerk should have the technical insight to explain it, but then he probably shouldn't use the terminology that comes from the brochure that he doesn't understand.\n\nAs much as I hate employees that act like they are better than their customers, even though they are working in their gym clothes - I might have been able to let this slide if it wasn't for his save of telling me I should switch plan, something I really didn't want to do, by offering me a promotion that they don't have anymore. This might look like a mistake, a mere oversight.. but this is his whole job! Push customers to get the features that creates revenue.\n\nNo Verizon, it was certainly not a pleasure doing business with you - and I would have switched operators by now, if it wasn't for the coverage. Since I have to put up with this crap, can we at least focus on the service then? Next time, is it too much to ask for someone that have a vague idea how a cellphone works, instead of a frat guy that moonlights as a bouncer?"
0,"This restaurant is horrid.  We went when they were within the first couple of weeks of opening.  They had lunch specials that included a drink, and there were flyers all over advertising it, but when I ordered it they said the drink was no longer included.  What?  The chips are the cheapo corn chips you get for $1 a bag at the grocery store.  The only thing that was good was the salsa bar; otherwise they are not worth going to.  The people behind the counter have no idea what is going on."
1,"I'm so sad this restaurant closed! It became our new favorite go-to for dinner when nobody felt like cooking. They had the best reuben sandwich I've ever had, ever! They also had delicious goat cheese and sun dried tomato quiche. I mean amazing, not just good! Come back Boswell's...come back!!!!"
1,First timer.  But now Not Last......  I love soup. Love Potato soup. Ordered a cup. Shoulddda had a Bowl. Sooo Good. Then ordered 32 Blue Steak Sub. To Much. Lots of tender grill steak Lots of mushrooms.  Lots of Cheese. Hot - Sloppy - so freaken good. You would think I Had Not Eaten In A Month.  Was a little slow at 3 pm when were there. Waitress explained how everything is Fresh-house made- never frozen. Recommend Onion Rings next time thank you 32 Blue. New Customer
0,"Not the pointe hotel of yester years.   Front desk personnel inept, refers every question to Consigner who is not very competent either.  No signage on building exterior to show elevator, ice machine out of service and no free wifi......really !\nDay 2 no housekeeping at 3pm and ice machine still out of order !\nOnly plus is the bed/pillows are very comfortable and there is a coffee maker in the room.  Still a big disappointment for the $$$$"
1,"Very cool there is now a Mediterranean/Greek/Middle Eastern joint in my area. Even cooler, they have delivery service 4 miles out! This place is in the strip mall where Naga and the yogurt place is. \n\nWhat I'm loving here are the non meat options that I had so far. \n\nSay yes to Eggplant Salad! Warm eggplant on bed of salad greens sprinkled with seasonings and almond slivers. The small size bowl was filled up plentiful of eggplant and perfect serving size for lunch.\n\nMy other favorite; the Vegetarian Combo Platter. It had many of my Greek and Middle East favorites,Baba Ganoush,Hummus,Grape Leaves, Falafel, and seasoned flat bread.  I enjoyed this dish! Although the hummus doesn't measure up to Bon Chef Cafe's version (I so miss Chef Ash!)\n\nThe Zatar seasoning that chef makes and uses in a lot of the dishes here is awesome!!! It was meticulously sprinkled on each slice of my flatbread. I had to comment and ask what's the deal with the spice blend he used because it's different from the Greek and Middle Eastern places I've been to. I learned from Chef Manny that his spice blend included thyme,sesame seeds, and ..I forget..but whatever it is, I was diggin it! Also he said he uses mint leaves and mentioned that he used it in the Eggplant Salad that I had couple weeks ago..(whoa dude remembered me??... xtra cool point!!!). I have to note from talking with him, he really takes pride in what he makes. I so appreciate that it's all made from scratch. \n\nThe Shrimp Kebab was also delish. A little confused though as to why it wasnt on a skewer. No biggie. It's nice that you can order it ala carte. And you can order the Beef, Chicken and Lamb kebabs too ala carte. \n\nThe only thing I wasnt too crazy about is the Tzatziki sauce...I want to say it's sour cream based. Kinda bland and consistency was just too thick and rich for my taste. It's all good though because the spices used in the gyro meat made up for it. But still a tad disappointing. But with the many menu choices that there are I can live without it. \n\nThey did a great job renovating the dining area. Smart use of space seating wise. Seems like a few more tables added than the previous tenants. (Fix8, Cino's, Lucca Deli)  Big plus to the TV  playing sports channel. I caught part of the baseball playoffs when I had a dinner break here.(Yay Giants!) \n\nPrice for lunch I found reasonable. It's fast/casual dining. Order at counter and they'll bring your food out to you. Service was good.  I found the staff pretty friendly and was impressed that Chef remembers his customers. The times I was there, there were quite a few regulars already coming and going to this fairly new place. Easy going dining experience. Ive got no major issues. For sure in my lunch/dinner rotation. Imma Fan!!! Four Stars!"
0,"Go for the atmosphere and to hang with friends to chat over the endless house wine.  For whatever reason my friends get a kick out of eating here, so every once in a while we stop by.  During my last trip in the middle of last month, a bunch of us stopped in for dinner.  \n\nThe food here is just really average.  The decor is cool and the location is really popular.  If you go, make a reservation and be ready for crowds.  \n\nI ordered the Veal Marsala and my veal wasn't the tender cuts of meat that you might expect.  Instead it was chewy.  Chewy veal?!?  Come on...  \n\nI do like drinking the endless house red wine out of the Godfather glasses, but that shouldn't be the only reason to go here."
0,"I was really excited about finding a gym that also offered a complete health and weight loss program. But so far I have been extremely disappointed with it. Everything that you get for free with your \""LT Bucks\"" turned into an hour of wasted time for me. No real information or counseling provided, just a sales pitch to try and get you to sign up for some weekly meeting with the trainer or nutritionist that is going to cost you 100 bucks an hour. And they really put the pressure on to try and convince you that you need all these tests - metabolic rate, food allergies, cortisol levels. And each one costs hundreds of dollars. Their strategy should be to educate those of us who generally want to learn about how to have a healthier lifestyle. Then we'd be even more loyal to Lifetime and they'd make their money back tenfold over time from the $55 monthly membership fee. And only push the extras if it is genuinely needed for that individual. Instead they all just seem like used car salesmen and it almost turned me off from the whole place.\n\nFor now I am just trying to push all that noise aside and focus on just the gym, which is actually pretty nice. They have a wide variety of equipment and there is never any wait. My biggest complaint is that their group fitness classes are insanely crowded. I actually saw one girl get knocked to the ground in Zumba class last week because it was just too packed in there. Seriously!"
1,"The guys at T & M are top notch, and know their stuff.  They installed my supercharger,  added some door hinges, and performed other work on my Jeep JK.   Service was perfect and I'm having them do more work in the future.  You won't find any better in Vegas."
1,"Location: On Rachel, West of St. Denis. Metered parking - use transit or walk.\n\nThe space: I really liked this loft-like cafe, with its communal tables and roomy interior. It offers up a very casual vibe, with good tunes and plenty of day light. I also liked the funky art that was scattered throughout the place. \n\nThe food: I ordered a Simit sandwich with black olive tapenade, avocado, tomato, sprouts. It was DELICIOUS. For those of you who don't know, a Simit is basically the Turkish equivalent of a bagel, but these are thinner and  lighter than your standard Montreal bagel. Having had Simit in Istanbul, I was pleasantly surprised at how bloody good these were. The clerk told me they make these in-house, so I guess that explains it. I also ordered the homemade lemonade, which was both refreshing and tasty. \n\nService: Good. Not super friendly, but I think the clerk was a bit on the shy, quiet side.\n\nPrice: Worth it. For $10, I got a huge sandwich and homemade lemonade. \n\nVerdict: Go. It's a great place to get a quick snack, chill out over a good book or to get a coffee with friends.  Also, they carry the same brand of Turkish coffee that I brought back from Turkey so.... BONUS!"
0,"NYPD claims to taste like NY pizza because they use \""Yonkers water\"" in their dough.  I grew up in Yonkers. My benchmark is Carlo's Pizza at the corner of Central Avenue and Tuckahoe Rd.  That is my neighborhood.  Yonkers wins the NY State water flavor championship on a yearly basis, so to make such a claim piqued my interest.   NYPD is some of the worst pizza I've ever had in my lifetime.  \n\nWe ordered pizza with tomatoes on top.  When I picked up the pizza and brought it home, I realized that the tomatoes were stale.  Yes they gave me a refund, but anyplace that serves pizza with stale toppings isn't worth my time.  I've never eaten there since.\n\nIf you want authentic NY Pizza forget NYPD and go to Ray's at the corner of Pima and Frank Lloyd Right."
1,"I have my favorite servers. Great service, love my Tuna Steak Cesaer salads! Thanks for caring: Jesse, Jenifer, Shawn, Megan, Monica, and cooks Jesse and Jason who do the best job of cooking the Tuna Steaks. To make it perfect, make the Tea stronger and the Ranch dressing thicker."
0,"It's not for me. The Mac 'n cheese did not taste homemade or fresh and for me that is a big no-no in the South. The pulled pork had way too much black pepper for my preference. Too bad, I just moved close by and wanted this place to be our go-to place for dinner out."
0,"We came here on a great vacation ruined by this Night Club of horror.  My gf got too drunk and while I was in the bathroom a predator working there, a large bald black man, took her by force and pulled her into an elevator.  He groped her and threatened to kick her out of the nightclub unless she committed explicit acts with him.  \n She obviously said no and was kicked out of the club.  Luckily she had a phone and got ahold of me but was terrified!  I took her home becauSe she was too drunk right away a and tried to call the club to complain.  Could not get ahold of any management.  Left a message and never a reply!!! Called the police made a report but my girl was too drunk to file a formal inquiry and was luckily unharmed.  \n\nBe very careful if you go here! Stay in groups and watch you friends or gf at all times!  I recommend not going here at all!  Very dangerous!  Who knows how many drunk women get taken advantage of here!  And not even a call back from management.  The guy probably still works there and preys on drunk women.  Dont get rapped, go party somewhere else."
1,"Cupcakes are just ok.  The cake part was fair, the frosting was good.  I did like that they have  secure carryout boxes."
0,"I placed an online order for a 8\"" sub and a large iced tea, and received an email confirmation and also the automated confirmation on their website. The message said the order would be delivered in 45 minutes, and it being a Saturday I expected my order to take the full delivery estimated wait time. After an hour went by, I decided to call the store and find out if my order was on it's way yet. I have been ordering from Silver Mine Subs for 5 years, and never had a very long wait time, especially on such a small order and always living near a location. When I called the store, the first person I spoke with said he did not receive my order to their system and that he didn't know what to do, that they just didn't get it, that they had been having issues with their online ordering, and I could just re-order. I stated that that was not acceptable and they needed to fix this issue and asked to speak with a manager. He put a \""manager\"" on the phone, who actually admitted that he was not a manager and only a shift leader. I expressed my frustration with lack of solution from speaking with the first employee, and the shift leader was no better. There was no empathy, or concern for keeping my business and he stated that there was NOTHING he could do and that I needed to call corporate. My order also totaled $12.60, however charged my account for $16.13, and when I mentioned that information, he as well said that it wasn't his concern and there was nothing he could do.  I even suggested that he deliver my food personally and I will show him my receipt for purchase to prove I wasn't trying to scam him, and he said he would not do that, and that if I wanted food, I need to re-pay and he would bring me my order. I kept asking him if he was being serious, or if this was a joke because never in my life have I ever had such terrible service, and he insisted there was nothing they were going to do, and that I needed to call corporate. I asked him for the corporate number, and he stated he didn't have it, and that I had to go online to get it. I politely told him to \""eff off\"", and called the websites corporate number, where I got someones voice mail. I left a message with my name, number and story of what had happened and never received a call back. This morning I called the store to see if maybe I could finally talk to a manager. I was able to talk with Justin, who repeatedly apologized once I told him the full story, and he sounded so embarrassed. He offered me to come in for my order this evening, and that he would also provide a gift card for future purchases as long as it meant keeping me as a customer. Funny how he also mentioned there was only three people working that time of day, and he knew exactly who I was talking about and that they have had previous problems with that employee. So all in all, I cannot say that I will ever eat from here again after I am done using the gift card, and the only reason I will use the gift card is because I do not want to waste it. Although the manager Justin finally fixed the problem, it still does not sit well with me that this could ever happen again at this location nearest me, and that a well known business in Arizona would hire people who act this way towards customers, and they knowingly kept him having had previous problems. I understand there are people who make mistakes at their jobs, but is the juice really worth the squeeze? Not for this girl."
0,"The crepes were too chewy and hard to cut with a knife, the smoothies tasted like artificially sweetened tang and overall the price was way too much for what we ordered. The only reason why this place gets 2 stars was because of the nice staff."
0,$5.45 for a bowl of soup and 1/2 a roll (literally the roll was sliced in half). While the broccoli cheese soup is very good I could get more for my money elsewhere....a lot more!
0,Not very impressed. I have some questions...why was there a geriatric population in the club? And why did the DJ suck balls? Large ones at that. And why were there no beautiful people for me to enjoy? At all. \nBUT....I am completely I'm love with the blonde bartender handling the bar on the upper level. She was theee shit. I love you miss. Forever. And I also have a tiny crush on her partner--the Asian bartender as well. :)
1,"It was a great experience partying outdoor!!\n\nWe arrived at 11:00, my friend booked one of the bungalows.  It was totally awesome!!  You get your little suit with a balcony, TV, couches, and your own restroom (didn't have to go far).  And stepping outside is a Little cabana, you can lounge there as well.. although it was a little wet due to the day pool party.  We also have a little pool about 3'-5' deep.  And yes we dipped our feet in there. \n\nHad a blast!!"
1,"Food was a solid 4/5, staff is great, they serve booze at a decent price throughout the day (aww, yea!), \n\nMy friend and I split a salad and a pizza about 2 weeks ago which was really great!  ....Then, last week, we had an office party with food catered from this location.  I want to be honest with you all:  DO NOT GET THE THIN CRUST......   I tried the Pesto Chicken Pizza with thin crust and the crust was basically like a crisp (Which I am not a fan of... If I wanted a one-sided quesadilla, I would spent $5 at Fredericos).\n\nMy side salad was good and THE BRUSCHETTA IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!\n\nI do recommend going to this location, getting some booze and amazing bruchetta..... for that, I thank you!!"
0,Super busy Starbucks they take forever in the drive thru do I went inside and it took forever inside a few employees just standing around doing nothing while everyone else was running their butts off not very professional I will go back because it's the only one in the area
0,"Tried Captain Steve's (take out) for the the first time this evening. We ordered three meals: The Fisherman's Platter, Fried Oysters, and Small Shrimp. The portions were generous but the taste was pedestrian at best. The seafood was on par with that of similar places like Captain's Galley and Mayflower, but the baked potatoes were overcooked, the onion rings were limp, and the hush puppies were the worst we have ever had. Not going back."
1,"I have been trying to trying find soccer cleats for my daughter for the past month.  She is 13 and in between sizes.  Not to mention looking for just the right design. We were on vacation in the Phoenix area and a Yelp and Google search lead us to this store.  It was perfect great selection and the prices were so reasonable.  The same cleat we picked at $90 was $150 at Dick's sporting goods.  They were so nice and have allot of soccer gear and clothes too.  To help us get just what we wanted Felipe was patient and brought us about 10 pairs of shoes making sure the fit was correct. If you are in the area a must stop.  Just check the opening times, 1200 Mon - Fri. Thank you she got a nice pair and I saved $$$ not a bad day"
1,"I'm actually kind of surprised to see all of these two and three star reviews for Zarkana. I really enjoyed it, minus the creepy big headed baby on the LCD screen.\n\nThe Zarkana theater is located at the Aria, and likewise, its architecture is just as beautiful and well thought-out. We were seated in the second tier of seats, but in the second row or so and had a great view of everything. I'm okay with not seeing the strained looks on the performers' faces as the do their crazy tricks. I think where we were sitting gave us the opportunity to focus on the individual acts and the outlying performers all at once. \n\nSo if there was some storyline for this, I missed it. I think the big headed cartoon baby freaked me out too much and then I got distracted by the juggling lady, the trapeze artists, the guy who could apparently carry a ladder and a woman on himself while standing on a ladder, well, you get the picture. The theme, however, is very circus-y, complete with a ringleader who sings in a language I do not understand. There are many Cirque shows to choose from in Vegas now, so do a bit of research on youtube first to see which theme best suits your interest :)"
1,"The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!  The condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, etc and they actually get my orders right first try.  If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes."
0,This place screwed my friend Marlena. She paid $59.99 for a service call and they said they would be back the next day and they weren't. She continues to try and call them to no avail. Now she is sitting with no dryer and out of $60!
1,Restaurant review only. \n\nExcellent 5 star restaurant!\n\nFirst class all the way!\n\nTip - Try the fried oreo's! YUM!!!!
0,"Did not live up to the previous reviews.  I got the mixed plate.  The lamb was ok, however, very overcooked and dry.  My wife ordered the chicken in cream.  It was worse than dog food.  Service was less than mediocre.  The worse part for me was that they had no coffee, at all.  What kind of Mediterranean place doesn't have coffee?"
1,I love this place I always come to this one the service is great always nice and funny and more then happy to tip the food is basic dinner food with a not so basic taste fully recommend it for a midnight snack and a good time
1,"A lounge in Vegas dedicated to the psychedelic music of the Beatles? No thanks. Free vodka drinks for ladies 10-12am. Uh...sure!! I'm Chinese, I can't turn down free!!\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm no Beatles hater, but having to listen to 'Yellow Submarine' and 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' sounded like less than party-hyphy-fun on a Friday night on my sister's Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. But boy, was I wrong!\n\nThe front of the lounge accommodated a mini \""pre\""-lounge complete with a full bar and humongous neon pink letters spelling 'Revolution' in which you could actually sit in, I nested on the 'o'. Very comfy. I was actually not aware of the real lounge till about 20 minutes after I arrived. When people started sifting in and out of a doorway to the left of the bar I started to think the party existed in there. I was right...so the rest of the dopey Bachelorette party I was with trudged through the doorway to discover a way bigger lounge with a way bigger full bar, a dance floor and a DJ.\n\nWhen we got there at 10:30, the joint was not crowded, but it was packed by 11pm. The walls projected images of walking, silhouetted hands with faces traipsing about the club amongst cartoon flowers and trippy, spinning swirls. Go-go dancers in skin baring ultra-minis and bikini tops danced on the table and bar tops. The music was very good; mixing in a huge serving of modern hits, several tablespoons of  Michael Jackson, a shot of Soft Cell (...tainted love...), a wisp of Journey and half a dash of Beatles songs. \n\nThe drinks were a bit weak and smiley cocktail waitresses kept hocking these sugary-sweet lemon drop shots that were pretty worthless with alcohol content - but they were free so my gratitude keeps me from griping too much. All in all, I loved the diverse, laid back crowd and the hybrid club-lounge vibe.\n\nThe next time I'm Vegas, even if they're not offering free drinks, I'm there...because this place is groovy, baby! (Trite, I know, but I couldn't help myself.)"
1,"I. FREAKIN. LOVE. PANERA.\n\nI loved Panera since they first started springing up in my old hometown in New York and was psyched that I would have one so close to our new place here in Charlotte.  Funny enough, it took us almost five months to finally stop in.  This location follows suite with all the others, but the service was incredibly friendly!\n\nI always go for the take two option and went for the summer corn chowder and a half turkey sandwich.  What a great deal for less than $9!  The food always tastes fresh and healthy.  My husband, who's never really ate at Panera much, agreed that it was worth coming back for lunch.\n\nMy only sadness was that I didn't realize that you could add on a dessert for .99 to any meal until we were on our way out.  I wish that were more prominently displayed, otherwise I definitely would have taken advantage of it!"
1,Jumping out at 855 was scary but so amazing . Very nice staff they r helpful with any needs u have. Get the DVD and picture package. It was great.
0,"And what were the food critics of Travel & Leisure smoking when they voted Chou's \""Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\""? We've been hearing about this place for a year or so, everyone \""RAVES\"" about the food. We finally read about it in the Travel & Leisure and gave it a shot today for lunch at 12:15 PM. Coming from NYC and dining at the best tiny holes in the wall, our expectations were high especially based on previous reviews read.\n\nCustomer service was very friendly, though a bit slow. Now onto the food review, I knew we were in trouble when I ordered hot tea and I opened the lid to see if the tea was ready and it was a tea bag instead of tea leaves, additionally the water that was delivered to the table had a horrible taste to it. We order:\n-  Hot and sour soup for 2, may have been the best part of our lunch, good, but didn't pack a punch on either spicy or sour.\n-  Beef Pies, what's all the hype, took a bite and got a mouthful of greasy juice, ground up mystery meat which was wrapped in a fried pancake.\n- Steamed dumplings with pork and napa cabbage, again OK, these may have been the best choice out of all the dumplings, they came out hot and were OK tasting.\n- Fried pork buns, horrible, doughy and the filling had no taste.\n- Orange Chicken, OK tasting, a little heavy on the batter and was not orange tasting enough.\n\nAll in all not a repeat visit in our book and certainly not a Travel & Leisure's \""Best Chinese Restaurants in the US\"" vote from us."
1,"Chain Schmain!  \n\nPei Wei is awesome. At Pei Wei I can spend less than $10 and have a great lunch, bring my dog, relax and read a book in the shaded patio AND get myself unlimited refills of fountain drinks.  BTW, when you have access to a good soda fountain, do yourself a favor and mix in a little soda water with your diet coke. You can't taste the difference and it's much healthier for you.  \n\nAccording to my calculations, I have been here about 84 times now and my favorites are the Pad Thai with chicken and the sesame beef."
0,"NO thanks. Horribhle crowd in this place, the rough crowd runs the bar in this place, not the bartenders! Keep your head down in your food if you want to avoid a bar fight with a middle aged meth head!"
0,"The staff, barring the afternoon clerk on the day we checked in, were uninterested in anything other than getting the job out of the way so they could get on with their personal conversations. Food, on Thanksgiving, not well priced and very dry..everything was very dry. The heat in the hotel itself was on full blast (it was about 50 outside) and when trying to regulate the heat in our room, it was impossible to get relief from the stifling heat even with the window open. The television didn't work, and we couldn't rent movies because, as the maintenance man said \""oh this hasn't worked all week\"". Thanks so much. When we checked at at midnight because it was so miserable, no one asked why we were leaving. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this hotel. Oh, and the woman in the gift shop? She followed me around asking \""are you going to buy THAT?\"", etc. Completely insane and ruined my entire Thanksgiving. When the manager called to follow up on my having filled out the survey, he was defensive, angry and unwilling to offer anything to assuage my disappointment. Complete waste of money and time to go to this hotel."
1,"This place is a classic.  Good food for a decent price.  Staff is awesome.  You can't go wrong with this place.  The charcoal broiled shimp are amazing.  If you go, ask for Linda for your server.  She rocks."
1,"Dough and potatoes sauteed in butter, a dive bar with Iron City on tap, super friendly people -- this place might just represent all that is good and pure left in the world.  I haven't been able to pry myself away from the pierogies long enough to try everything else on the menu, which I intend to do before the Stillers knock on seven's door.  The happy hour is a great deal, with half off on pierogies and cheap rotating brews.  I'm not giving it four stars only because the deck and dining room aren't terribly well separated, so it's often a little tough to breathe inside.  Although, I'm sure a pierogi expert could comment on how the smoky air balances the pillowy texture of the delicate pierogies..."
1,"I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork. That narrowed our choice to pretty much pancakes (just say \""killing me softly with your buttah..\""), so we bolted -- to Palatte. \n\nI'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food, but for this New York food snob, the choices are too few to wield my wallet."
0,I was disappointed w my whole experience. The server was never to be found. I ordered a drink from a bus boy. I was there from 830-1041pm. The amount of time that passed between each course was ridiculous. The beautiful cut of sea bass I ordered was over salted & cold. The ribeye my sister ordered was about 3/4 inch thick. I would choose any other steak house in Pittsburgh over Eddie Merlots again.

1,"Love, love this place!! I wanna live here!! This is our place when we go to Vegas. I'm with someone who is a VIP so I get to enjoy the amenities like the Sky Suites and the VIP lounge. The rooms-they have the most comfortable beds ever and the high-tech gadgets. Most of the time I just stay in the room and never get bored. The housekeeping staff are the best and meticulous at what they do. We always come back to a fresh and clean room and chocolates on our pillows. The casino- it always smells nice and fresh and always clean. Service is always friendly. The only rude personnel I came across here are somebody at Jean Phillipe (the bakery) and that Ronald guy from the VIP lounge. Anyhoo, everybody here is so nice-from front desk to bellhops, to limo drivers to housekeeping. I esp love the people at the VIP lounge-Hi Alfred, Esmeralda, Virginia and of course, Armando. They're the best!! Not Ronald though, he was rude. \n\nOther than a couple of rude personnel, I love this place. This is my favorite place in Vegas."
0,"Their large margarita is more like mini margarita. The mole looked and tasted more like super salty gravy. One mole plate, one bean burrito and two small margaritas ended up costing $34."
1,"had my Toyota truck' s water pump, transmission and radiator replaced last summer by this shop. thought the water pump might of been leaking and even though the wAIT was over 2 Hours long the new shop manager seem too perform all necessary tests to make sure it wasn't. so fAR SO GOOD."
1,"As Jenny L has reported, we sampled the delights here today.  I knew ahead of time that they only had cakes and coffee (c/o Googling it at work that morning) so was mentally prepared for coffee and cake for lunch, yum.\n\nMiss J (!) has already told you all about the lovely (yet normal) apple and almond cake/tart that we chose as well as the last minute choice of the chocolate, almond and fig tart which SO interesting.  They were both very yummy and I was so glad J was happy to get to two pieces and share so we could have twice the cake joy.  \n\nThe thing with other coffee shops/tea houses/places where you gorge on cake is that they tend to have the same general things.  What is great about the Chocolate Tree is that you can go for the usual muffin or chocolate chip cookie (though theirs was labeled chocolate hazelnut which excited me and is begging me to come back and eat one, or a dozen.  Whatever) or you can go for something completely new and interesting.  \n\nThey have loads of vegan, gluten free and non-dairy cakes as well, which I'm sure some people will be all about but I'll be completely honest with you when I say that, being intolerant to none of the above, kind of bummed me out.  I've never had a gluten, vegan or non-dairy cake which really floated my boat like the ones which have it all.  That being said, I'll give their v/gf/nd cakes a chance because they look sooooooooo pretty, and that's really what it's all about, right??"
1,"I think this is the first 5-star review that I have given an eating establishments, but what can I say- Legume deserves it.  Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Seriously comparable to a NY/CA foodie restaurant.  BYOB too- which is always nice.\nThe cuisine is delectable, and can best be described as fresh, seasonal, local, organic fare.  I would say \""California Cuisine\"" but won't for obvious reasons.  Everything we have eaten here, from the appetizers to the desserts are amazing.\n\nA few downsides that aren't a hang up for me- but may be for other people.  The restaurant, located in Regent Square is TINY, (that being said, it is MOVING to a bigger location in Oakland this Summer-yeah!) I have always made reservations beforehand.  Also, because of the small space, the restaurant only has a certain number of certain entrees, etc.  My fiance ALWAYS chooses what they have run out of- so that's kind-of annoying, but I get it.\n\nTotally amazing- really yummy, charming atmosphere, polite staff. Loves it."
1,The hours are wrong for Sunday. Beware. The food is wonderful but yelp is posting the wrong hours on Sundays. I'm here at 7pm and this amazing restaurant is closed.\nI am sad
0,"I'd give 0 stars if I could. Rude, rude, rude. It's as if we should be lucky enough to be served a scoop of freezer burned ice cream. Every flavor has a coating of ice on it. The mint chip was so icy, that she was using a spatula to pry it out. We canceled our order mid scoop and left. Do not bother with her terrible attitude and old ice cream."
1,"This is a good BBQ place that serves a good brisket.   I usually go for sausage and brisket while my husband is the rib eater.  I grew up in Texas and ribs must fall off the bone, so I do not find too many places here in town that meet that criteria, so I usually will try his.\n\nThis place also has a unique item for appetizers, fried pickles, if you haven't tried them before, they're not bad.  Overall, the meats had a good smokey flavor, the ribs were tender, but just not Texas perfect, but close. The sides of cole slaw and collard greens were also very good.\n\nI recommend this place, overall, not a bad BBQ."
0,"Got a groupon for $30 for 4. I asked the receptionist/front desk how much is the regular price and she said $10+/person. First, the place is not busy, not even 10 people inside that big place. Second I notice was the dust infront of the receptionist table/counter, she's not busy! Why can't she wipe her counter! I could write my name on it!... Yikes! The one star I'm giving is for the place, it's very classy, minus the dust. Restrooms are clean and can compare it to a hotel on the strip. The servers are very nice and attentive. Gave them a good tip! Food... Half star! Selection was not very good, I guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and that's it! Food is very dry, over cooked and very few selection. The only dessert are jello (my daughter made a comment that it's like a square gummy!) have a few fruits, a pudding, no cakes or cookies. They have that soft serve ice cream. I'm pretty sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks. We left like 1pm and they couldn't even fill up half the place. They are not open for dinner. That's why they charge so much it's not for the food but to pay for their rent. My suggestion go to Krazy Buffet (By Sahara and Cimarron) or Buffet@Asia (they have a couple of branches but the best one was at Spring Mountain and Sahara. You won't even have to pay $10 for lunch and the food is way better than over here (10x way better!) Save your money and just eat at Panda Express, you'll be very pleased! Never coming back here. It's a waste of money, gas and time."
1,"If you have a lot of hungry mouthes to feed this is your place.  Huge portions with excellent flavors. The banana foster french toast is a winner.   If you like eggs benedict i highly recommend them.  The omlettes are quite large and look like an upside down pie pan.  The three times i have been there i have not been disappointed, but like most breakfast joints if you dont like your homefries raw ask for them to be well done."
0,This place gave me an undersized sandwich and food poisoning that kept me consistently on the toilet for the next 48 hours.\n\nI'd definitely avoid and so should you.
1,"My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far."
1,The service was excellent and the food was even better! I highly recommend you try this place.
0,"My family and I have been dining at Sakana on Elliot for at least a decade and for the most part, have been very satisfied with our experiences. In fact, we would call it one of our \""go-to\"" places. Over the last 6 months or so however, that has changed and as of today, I will not go back. Craving fresh sashimi and being consistently disappointed has not been good for my loyalty nor my pocket book. Today, my son and I tried yet again, wanting to give Sakana another chance. Today the albacore was fishy and mushy, some of the other fish was \""borderline\"" and my cucumber roll lacked any substance or finesse.We were told nothing would be done in terms of compensation (i.e. taking something off the tab) because we did not inform them in enough time. Poor quality food, poor service...big bummer."
1,Food was really good! Very good service too
0,Pricy for the kind and selection of food that they have. They don't even have seaweed salad.  I'd rather go to Asian Buffet or Makino next time.  The only thing I like is the caramelizes sweet potato with sesame  seeds.  It took a long time to cook the meat by the temperature of the grill.  Service was okay!
0,"We ordered the Surf & Turf Rodizio ($49.95) and the Meat Rodizio ($38.95) figured we save a few dollars by sharing the seafood items.\n\nI was underwhelmed with the salad bar. We moved right onto meat parade. We had Picanha, filet with Parmesan crust, pork loin, chicken - hot and bbq, ham, sausage, turkey wrapped in bacon, pineapple, and lamb... we were served in that order. We repeated the Picanha, filet, and ham. We practically had to beg for the lamb, it took three requests before it was brought to the table. For the most part the meats were good. It was only the sausage that I absolutely did not like.\n\nThe surf consisted of shrimp glazed with butter, scallops in butter, grilled salmon and tempura cod. The seafood was BAD, Bad, bad. I couldn't even choke down a scallop, I spit it out. The shrimp were rubbery, the salmon was nearly jerky and the cod was bland and the tempura was hardly intact. They offered to bring another plate, but we refused. \n\nService was adequate."
1,"Well, having been to the Monk's location in downtown Wisconsin Dells, WI and had a good experience, we thought we should try out the newest location closer to us. It was great. The atmosphere was great and enjoyable. The staff were extremely nice in every way. And the food... was just amazing. Some of the burgers are really different, and taste just awesome. The service was also quick, and got our food pretty fast. And the price, just wasn't to bad. We will defiantly going back here again."
1,"Gotta say that the portions are huge! Had the steak and pork fajitas, pork was better, steak was pretty dry.  The wife had tacos al carbon, she loves it. We couldve shared one and had leftovers! Great place and ambiance, great service. The habanero hot salsa was very good.  We will be adding Nandos to our rotation. :-)"
1,"We ate at the bar during Andre's \""5-6-7\"" happy hour.  Beers are $5, interesting cocktails $6, and appetizers $7.  The bartender who served us was excellent, crafted great drinks (I tried the Pomegranate Lemon Drop and the Cucumber Collins -- both delicious).  DH had Batch 19 beer, a Colorado prohibition-era brew recipe.  From the $7 app menu, we tried the sliders, juicy beef with roquefort on fresh house-made brioche, and added fries for $1 ... also enjoyed the charcuterie platter, combining meats, cheeses, pickles, toast, dried fruits, stone-ground mustard -- perfect bites of sweet, salty, tangy, spicy.   And chickpea panisse featured moist triangles of chickpea patties topped with a tangy tomato relish ... sort of a super-fancy deconstructed falafel.\n\nWe also \""splurged\"" on the calamari petals from the regular bar menu -- that was $14. This is a nice twist on the traditional calamari rings ... here, they're flat, oval shaped pieces of squid, fried with a crunchy coating and a lemony aioli for dipping.  Mmmmm.\n\nThis bar menu is a great deal ... and it makes me want to try Andre's for dinner, because the chefs showed great care in preparing all our food."
1,"We visited this place today for lunch.  Overall, we were impressed with the quality of the food.  My burger was perfectly cooked and the pot roast fries were quite yummy.  We had the short ribs appetizer and that was really, really good.  My husband had the prime rib sandwich and the truffle gorgonzola fries.  He really liked it.  Our daughter ordered a salad with salmon and she couldn't finish it.  The service at the time of the day during which we went was very good.  The downside is its cold in the bar.\n\nI can see that things might get dicey when things get busy."
0,"I really wanted this place to be good..  It's close to my house..  \n\nStrike 1, the door guy is a complete DOUCHE. \nStrike 2. The entire place smells like raw sewage..  \nStrike 3. The bar tenders make horrible, week drinks that are expensive. \n\nBoooo..  I may never return..  Gawd, I used to love Krave.. I hope this is not what we have to look forward to..  I can't even believe it's the same owners.."
0,Haircut was basically just a fade and a lil trim here and there.. Took less than ten minutes for 12 dollars... And a pretty crappy job.. Wont be going there again
1,"I've only eaten here once. And when I went, it was a nice time. I had a nice strawberry & chicken salad. It was verrrry sweet! It almost hurt my teeth! The place is very beautiful and small. I don't recommend coming with a large group unless you want to dine outside. \n\nThe outdoor dining area is very beautiful. The Hear Museum is a very pretty place. I love the water canal and mock wo'o (swimming holes). \n\nMy largest complaint is that besides the Pesole (which isn't that great btw), nothing on the menu is traditional Native American Fare. As a Native person who appreciates the wonderful tastes and textues of traditional Native foods from the many tribes of Arizona... to have a museum that celebrates our cultures and yet doesn't celebrate our food is counter productive and disappointing. We eat more than frybread!!\n\nIf you're out at the museum and want a nice quiet lunch in a tranquil autmosphere this is a great place to dine. But PLEASE don't think what they serve is what Natives eat!"
0,"I feel for the reviewers who think Lulu's is worth 5 stars.\n\nThe noodles here are edible, three-star college area food. The bubble tea is tasty although I do belong to the group of people who prefer not to have chunky taro bits in the drink. I've never even considered asking for it without the bits because the service here is horrible. \n\nThis joint a great example of the many Pittsburgh businesses who have not yet realized that the demographic of the city is changing. Debit and credit cards are not a fancy new invention that can be ignored at will. Don't want to take my debit card at 4pm? (hey, I'm not longer breaking your asinine lunch rule) Have shitty rude staff who will actually ignore me while trying to pay for my meal because they don't want to run the card? I'll be eating somewhere else. Food isn't worth the b.s."
0,"All Wal-Marts suck. This one especially is an anomaly. \n\nAround Easter, they got rid of the lamb shanks they sold at $7/each and replaced them with a huge rack of lamb, wait for it... for $40!!! \n\nOn the same visit, I saw a cardboard display with a bin full of 50 cent spices. I think \""all right, found a deal\"". Wrong. Happened to notice the ingredients on so-called \""lemon pepper\"" and the list read like a chemistry book. When I buy $1 spices at Fry's, I don't have to read the ingredients to know what I'm getting. \n\nRegardless of the number of items in your cart, one thing or a mountain of stuff, it takes 30 minutes to get through a line. That was my last shopping experience at ANY Wal-Mart and it's been a few years. I value my sanity."
0,"Well.....I gave this place 3 chances, but I'm done. While the food was good ( I like the twice baked potato skins and my fiance likes the sliders)....the service was so terrible that I just don't want to bother anymore. I have been here three times to eat....twice later at night after work around midnight and once on a Sunday in the afternoon. The server at night, which I think was the same both times, took at least 10 minutes to acknowledge us. She seemed very pre-occupied with her male tables. She was completely unengaging, no smile, no personality....just an \""order taker\"".  Food also takes forever so don't bother if you want a quick bite. (I'm sure skins take a bit to cook....but 30 minutes??) As far as our Sunday afternoon visit, I will say that the server did seem overwhelmed with the football crowd. She messed up our order, forgot we gave her a coupon, took forever, etc. Props though to the bartender who came around from the bar and pre-bussed our table.\nI've been a server for 13 years and its places like these I just want to come in and show 'em how its done!! I could sell the hell out of this place and I have the friendly personality to keep 'em coming back!\n\nOh well...plenty of other places that are more welcoming in the southwest part of town."
1,Out-of-towners need to put Fogo de Ch\u00e3o Brazilian Steakhouse on their bucket list of steakhouses to eat at in Scottsdale. I had the New York Sirloin with the pepper crust and it was delicious. Just the right spice to complement the Markham cabernet we selected. My wife had the Halibut and it too was outstanding. Our servers were attentive and very helpful. We had a wonderful evening.
0,"Maintenance here is ridiculous. My bathroom sink would leak like crazy after the warm water ran for a minute. They told me it was fixed, I'd come home turn the water on and by the time I was done taking my shoes off my bathroom was flooded. My kitchen sink started to leak so they replaced it and now I have next to no water pressure. \n\nThe appearance of this place is getting worse and worse. One example, our pool has been green all summer. \n\nRecently, I signed another lease and my rent for a one bedroom went up over $100 a month. That is disgusting to treat a tenant that way. As if they already aren't making a ton of money already, I got charged $50 because my rent wasn't paid on the 1st that was a holiday! I log on to my account on the 2nd to pay, thinking there wouldn't be a problem since the 1st was a holiday. Nope! $50! No grace period, not willing to work with me. I've never been late, ever! And it was the day after a holiday! I don't understand how they can be so unwilling to see the facts and help me out. \n\nI would never recommend this place to anyone."
0,"I had a very disappointing experience with a take out order from Shun Lee.  I was surprised that the same entree which I ordered a month or two ago had decreased in volume by about a third.  Plus, it didn't taste as good as the last time I ordered the same entree.  \n\nI was even more surprised when the price was two dollars more than the price on the take out order from my last visit.  The friendly woman at the register said that the prices had gone up.  However, when I got home and read the new photocopied take out menu, the price had gone up only twenty five cents from that which was on the menu which I had ordered from.\n\nI think that the quality, quantity and price of Shun Lee have decreased in quality overall since the new owners took over.  I had frequented this restaurant regularly while Frank Lee owned it over the last thirty years.  \n\nI will definitely think twice about returning to eat or take out at Shun Lee Palace in the future."
0,"SPOILER ALERT! Details of the show are in this review, if you don't want to know what happens in Blue Man Group stop reading now! \n\nBut i'm guessing that you'll continue reading because like everyone else, nobody really has any idea what Blue Man Group is about. You're usually thinking, \""Blue people? Music? They don't speak, or something?\"" Without actually seeing the show, the general details about this show are vague. \n\nThe show is (for the purpose of trying to boil it down) a comedy/music show. The three blue men are suppose to represent the internet or how social interaction works in this day in age, or are a representation of our personal insecurities. They all have their own silly mannerisms. and the audience feels safe laughing with them because they're all very curious and act socially awkward. This is the style of comedy you sit through for almost 2 hours, but I can assure you it gets confusing and repetitive very quickly. \n\nThe acts in this show include eating Captain Crunch, eating Twinkies, and eating Marshmallows. These are 3 different scenes that each last at least 10-15 minutes a piece. They eat these things while being socially awkward with one another. I swear to god, that's it. Additionally, there is a scene where they show you signs with words on them- and you read them until somebody walks into the auditorium late, at which point they bust those people out with a spotlight and putting them on the big screen. Its just a lot of cheap laughs for a majority of the show. \n\nThere is also a lot of drumming, which takes a certain amount of talent to do... but I'm really reaching to compliment the show when I say that. They drum, and they drum, they hit a few pvc pipes and drum some more. It's kinda 'neat' when they drum over the paint and the paint splashes around, but this is literally all they do they entire show. \n\nThe highlight of the show comes during the grand finale, when the Blue Men pull toilet paper over the audience. The audience is literally entirely covered with toilet paper- but again I can only use the word 'neat' to describe this. It's an exciting rush for about 2 minutes, after sitting through 2 hours of watching them eat food and drumming. \n\nI paid $55 for my ticket via travelzoo, and when I left I felt like I wasted my time... If you do see this show, know that there is NO BAD SEAT in the house, and that the poncho zone doesn't get very wet at all... At the show I went to, the audience wasn't really into it and everyone seemed confused... There was probably a time when Blue Man Group was the hottest show in Vegas, but I think it's time is up... Maybe I'm just out of touch, but this style of comedy/music show just wasn't for me =/"
0,"Really, better sauce comes in a jar!  No basil on caprese salad, and swimming in dressing.  But what do I know.  Never had caprese salad with dressing."
0,"So bad , using bad chicken which is overdate and tasty like shit. Smell so bad with gongbao chicken.  I promise I will never ever back."
0,"We have been Stein Club members for years and have had really positive experiences in the past with Gordon Biersch.  We have attended Stein Club and Passport parties as well as classes with Brewmaster Lovelady.  We loved all that.  Unfortunately, all good things apparently must come to an end.  We have noticed a decline in the quality of service, food and beer over the past year or so.  We have visited less and less because of it.  Tonight may be the last night we ever go there.  The food was terrible.  We had appetizers which were featured.  The fried onion stack tasted worse than fried onions in a can .. like they were triple dropped in the fryer.  There was no onion in there at all as far as I could tell...  the filet mignon sliders were supposed to be 2 ounces... well if they were a half an ounce that is generous.  They were tasteless and smelled like old beef.  The brats were tasteless.  The pretzel roll was probably the best thing we ate... and that's not saying much.  Even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting.  We have always loved the beer but this evening, even the beer was bad.  The Maibock was flat and tasted turned.  The Pilsner was underwhelming and also flat... far beneath our prior experience.  Happy Hour prices for beer went up and no one informed us of that.  We complained to the manager who pretended to care and do something or another on the register but when it came time to pay the bill... which took forever to get.... nothing had been done to compensate us for the terrible service, terrible beer and terrible food.  It was abysmal in every possible way.  We have always been good customers and good tippers.  They have lost good customers tonight.  If this was the first time, we might have ignored one bad experience but, this has been a long time coming over the past year or so.  Sorry.  No more.  Or No Mas."
0,"The buffet at Treasure Island was a huge disappointment.  I have had better food at Ponderosa back in the days.  I was excited to compare this buffet with the one at Main Street in Old Vegas (Downtown).  So I roll in and notice that it was a lot cleaner that is for sure.  But the taste of disappointment filled my mouth when I took my first bite.  There were two things that help salvage this place from getting a one star review.  The first was how good the service was.  Finally the dessert station was crazy good.  They had mini donuts, cookies, cakes, pies (excuse me I had to wipe the drool from my mouth), ice cream, and flippin cotton candy!  \n\nIf you have bland taste buds then this place is for you.  Otherwise, I'd recommend you go elsewhere to satisfy your hunger!!"
0,"Where were the weird nitro going-ons when I stopped in?? This place was super dead. Employees were just sitting around. \nI was really excited to try their popcorn concoctions and I left feeling \""meh\"". \nThey kindly allow you to try the popcorns and I was a bit thrown off by the almost stale-like crunch they had to them. We did order the white cheddar and s'mores just to give it a fair shot and also because I felt slightly odd walking in, trying their popcorn and then walking out....\nThe white cheddar actually tasted pretty gross. It had an odd cheese doodle-like, crumby coating to it. Left the fingers messy! The hubz was turned off immediately because he disliked the hint of sweetness it had, but he liked the s'mores flavor a lot. I  was kinda disappointed by the lack of graham cracker/marshmallow that that particular flavor should have had in abundance. Its nothing special.\n\nI'm a fan of those Christmas time popcorn tins (more for nostalgic reasons) and I was looking forward to putting together a gourmet one this year,...this place just inspired me to make it myself at home. :\\ Bummer."

The V3 Flip,  Stingray mod, Itaste svd vv/vw as well as the asModUs competition style rda, puma Vail quad coil rda,  the magma rda, and the UD ego W. I will continue to visit and buy from Dave and eventually get an authentic mod as they spoiled me by letting me hit their personal authentics. Dave is a good friend. Everyone needs to come visit."
0,"I'm a fan of pizza but this place has some serious quality control issues. Last Saturday I ordered a supreme pizza for pick up. I went to the restaurant and stood at the counter for 10 minutes without being helped. Finally I asked the delivery driver on his way out the door if someone could help. He doesn't say anything to me turns around and sends someone out to help me. The cashier doesn't greet me or apologize for the wait just asks for my name. I get my pizza and go home open the box and take a slice out and notice its completely doughy, stretchy and not even close to being cooked. I am so pissed now. I call pizza hut and ask to speak to a manager,  I'm then told to hold then the phone call is disconnected. I call back and get the manager Josh this time and tell him the situation. Josh did apologize, I told him there's no way I'm coming back for another pizza or having one delivered covered in spit, I told him I wanted a refund. The manager did refund my money.  I ended up calling Papa John's to order a pizza, the team member was friendly and polite and my pizza arrived in 30 minutes and fully cooked and fresh. Papa John's delivery driver was also very polite and thanked me for my business. I will not being ordering from the Pizza Hut on Val Vista and Warner. Papa John's now has a new loyal customer!"
0,"I went on a personal recommendation with high hopes for finally finding a stylist in Las Vegas that I can trust. The atmosphere is very high energy. Sal is lovely and very engaging. However, for me the music is a bit too loud (I left with a migraine) and the haircut was not nearly as good as my stylist back East. Too much thinning and texturizing left my wavy hair with frizzy flyaways, no body and tangles. The color is almost the same as before the appointment, no improvement, but thank goodness no disaster either. I couldn't stand to have a bad haircut AND a bad hair color all at once. It looks as though I will be planning my future vacations to include a visit to my beloved, one and only hairdresser back home. There is no one in this city that comes close!"
1,"We had an absolutely incredible experience at Olives. Every dish that we had was perfect and tasted amazing. The cocktails were also delicious. The pastas were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The pizzas were awesome. The service was perfect and very hospitable. The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains. If you make reservations, ask for the patio so that you can enjoy the show. I would vote Olives as one of the best meals that I have ever had."
1,We called in for appetizer trays of assorted sushi and rolls.  The fish was prepared perfect and was some of the freshest I've ever had.  No fish smell. \n\nThe nice lady I worked with was very professional and accommodating even staying open 30 min later for us to take away our order on a Sunday.\n\nThe price of sushi vary greatly in parts of the USA but I would say this was on the high side.  I would recommend this place to someone with out hesitation as long as they realize this is not a budget meal.
0,"So I went to this bar last night with a group from work. The bar tender was extremely friendly and had a great personality. This was during the Sunday night football game so there were roughly 15 people in the bar. After the game, it was only my group of 3 and 1 other customer. So we moved to a table and attempted to order food! There seemed to be a waitress on site but did not come to our table! I had to walk up to the kitchen window and order food as if I was at McDonalds!! Only difference is McDonalds would have had better service! The \""waitress\"" seemed to not care about anything except the fact she was friends with the owner! I asked if there was any specials and the girl yelled to the bar tender \""is the game on still on\""! Once she realized the game was over she said NOPE! Sense it was a celebration with my team, I ordered a pizza anyway! I should have taken my team to Pizza Hut, the service would have been better and the food sure would have as well! No need to stop or order food from here it will be a waste of time and money!"
1,Amazing experience. Had the lamb and it was so tender and juicey. I could have it for every meal.
0,6pm Tuesday night.   No ribs no pork.  Might as well just close for the night. Hostess was very nice and apologetic.  TC's here I come.
1,"Great pizza , big slices got 2 pieces for 9 bucks buffalo chicken and cheese pizza and it's right across the street from my room at the hard rock . Pizza is the best food late night when you've been drinking all day"
0,"My wife and I just stopped at the Dairy Queen on central on our way home. I got the pumpkin pie blizzard. I was giddy like a school girl. There were tiny hairs all over my entire blizzard. It was repulsive. I will never go there again, and this is depressing, because Dairy Queen in Philly was a high school hang out for me."
1,"great pizza from the graziano family. \n\ngreat subs, tasty sauces, nice crust, lots o beer.\n\nno complaints what-so-ever"
1,"My daughter's high school basketball team comes to the Arizona Grand Resort twice every year for the Nike Tournament of Champions.  It is a beautiful place, centrally located, with lots of amenities at the resort and nearby. This year we had a problem with the wi-fi access in the Mountainside rooms, but the manager made it right by us.  Our team enjoyed themselves, and it is a good value, so we'll keep coming back to this resort."
0,Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.
1,"Finally! FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do you hear the word that is coming out of my mouth?! Finally, a Polish restaurant in the QC! I thought I would never see such a thing here. OK let me compose myself and get on with it..\n\n Because of time, we decided to do a take out order. We had the following:\n\nPotato Pancakes which were HUGE and DELICIOUS! They are offered as an app and you get 3 but because of their size, I could easily have these as a meal. They were crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. The potato is pureed (as it should be) with a hint of onion. They are served with either apple sauce or sour cream. I opted for neither simply because I grew up eating these with only a pinch of salt and that's exactly what I gave them and they were perfect!\n\n2 different types of Perogies which we ordered fried (because the fried potato pancakes were not enough). For the health conscious, you can have them boiled. The potato and cheddar was my favorite. They were very tasty. Plump little pillows of dough with a large amount of potato and cheddar in the middle? How can you not love that? We also had an order of the meat filled Perogies, which were fine, a little bland but still fine. \n\n2 orders of Golabki or in the US they are Golumbki and in NEPA we call them Piggies. Aside from the potato pancakes, the Golabki was what I was really interested in tasting. I will have you know my Grandmother, made the BEST piggies on the planet. Just sayin. So Golabki is cooked cabbage leafs that are filled with meat and rice and then stewed in a tomato sauce. Is your mouth watering yet?These were very good, not better than my Grandma's but still very good. The cabbage was cooked to perfection and they were nicely filled but the meat to rice ratio was off. These were filled with mostly rice. I personally would have liked a little more meat BUT overall the piggies were DELISH. I would go back for these any day. \n\nOverall our experience was a success and we can add a new restaurant to our list of places to go. For me personally, the food took me back to my youth and the great memories I have of growing up in and around our Polish community with their beautiful customs and fabulous cuisine."
0,"If you are looking for a place that has loud rap music, TV in the bar blaring with people making a lot of noise in the bar, this is the place to go. The service was mediocre, before I was served my entry the busboy tried to take my bread plate with my bread still on it, I had to grab it back from him. I was taking my girl friend there and we were both dressed up and would have felt better with jeans and a T Shirt. I was embarrassed for her and myself as we were expecting a nice romantic place and it was just the opposite. We were on a special package which include desert. The desert came with cotton candy a couple of cookies , pretty stupid I would think. The food was good  but not worth the price ."
0,"So far I'm not happy. I dropped off a coat to be cleaned and have a button sewed on. It was supposed to be ready Friday evening. But when I came to pick it up, my coat was the only item not ready. No apologies, not even a courtesy call to let me know? Disappointing."
1,"Great calimari. Ahi tuna was very yummy. \nGreat service too. Tuna tartare tacos were awesome, order 2!\nAnother Sam Fox hit !"
1,"We went for a family celebration. Two days before, I had returned from a trip to France. I can tell you that the meal at Coup Des Tartes was better than most of the meals I had in Paris.\n\nI had been warned that it was BYOB but I had forgotten. Take note! We ran up the street to Total Wine and grabbed a few good bottles.\n\nThe cheese plate starter was divine. Who doesn't love triple creams or humbolt fog. But it was also showered with delicious fruits and nuts. \n\nThe salad had that inexplicably light and flavorful touch that I have come to love of salad's in France.\n\nI had the Arctic Char which was cooked to perfection. The steak and pork that was also had at the table were superb.\n\nThe staff was not overly knowledgeable but very warm and the service was good, not overbearing and not neglectful. \n\nI have to say that I was still remarking the next day about the excellent quality of the food. \n\nIts a perfect spot for a romantic dinner or celebration. Lovely atmosphere, delicious food and service with a smile. What more could you want?"
0,"Gawd Awful!! So apparently blondie behind the bar doesn't know how to make simple cocktails, she poured half a container of cherry juice in my Manhattan. Last I checked Manhattans don't usually come with half a glass of cherry juice. Secondly, she made us move over into the corner because her bar was 'filling up'!! There's like 6 people in here?! Seriously?? We obliged and it was for ABSOLUETLY no reason!! Where we were sitting remained empty!! It's fine to hire cute bartenders, just please make sure they know how to bartend."
0,"This is a Crowne Plaza? This is more like a standard motel 6 that costs 3x the amount. I mean I got a king size office suite and it has a tiny tube tv in it. I didn't even know these things still existed outside of them at Salvation Army. Bathroom is blah, I'm questioning cleanliness of bed sheets and room in general. Staff at front desk was really nice though."
0,"Had dinner tonight and it took almost three hours to get salads our main course and dessert which was provided free because we complained.   We've been here many times before and never experienced service this poor.   The manager said there were no issues in the kitchen which was clearly not the case.  After offering us the free dessert the manager never took the time to come back and check in with us.   Had he bothered he would have been told that it was taking too long for everything.   When we went to find the manager he was eating dinner in the bar.   Glad he was apparently happy.  It is a shame, because this isn't what we've experienced in the past.  Won't be going back.\n\nWe were contacted by Vito's as a result of this review and an email I sent them directly.  I've added a star as a result.  I do appreciate their follow up.  They reviewed their videos of the dining room and we were not there three hours.  Closer to two and a half.  We were also not the only group to complain."
1,"I love going to Fellini's. The service is always consistently great, and so is the food. The dining rooms are quiet little escapes painted to look like Italian villas, and it makes it very easy to forget you are in a casino. And that alone is a huge plus. Let's face it, I can cook better Italian at home, but sometimes, you just wanna go somewhere nice and have someone else do the work. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable and the portions are sure to fill you up, and then some. I am a creature of habit, and always tend to get the same thing. I order the chicken parmesian and my ex always got the fettucini alfredo with chicken. The servings are big enough that you can share each others food, and still have plenty of what you ordered to enjoy. The alfredo is very rich but that's basically the point. The chicken parm is awesome it's a good sized breast (insert obligatory \""that's what he said\"" joke here) and it comes with pasta. The complimentary bread is pretty good; not \""oh my god amazing!\"", but good. The garlic bread is decent. The house wines are pretty reasonable as well.\n\nI never have any complaints and the prices are on par with most Italian restaurants. So I say you shouldn't be disappointed giving Fellini's a shot."
1,"I thought I had been to some good clubs, I was wrong. The Bank is the best nightclub I have been to so far. This place went beyond my expectations and it was all very reasonable. It cost me $20 entrance with a reduced entry fee since we hooked up with a promoter and the ladies in my party were free. They also go free drinks, although us guys had to pay if we ordered a drink. The ladies got unlimited drink vouchers and so I just got my drinks from my wife. DJ EarWaxx was spinning the tunes and he did an awesome job, everybody was hopping in that place. They had burlesque girls in the place, the waitresses for the reserved seats were very interactive with their guests. This place was just awesome, I would come back to this place if I had the chance to do it all over again."
1,"Great food and great staff! Our waitress was awesome, checked in when we needed her but didnt hound the table. The manager and gm checked with us as well. I reccomend the bacon cheddar mashed potatoes!"
0,"Terrible service, I don't know if they're understaffed or they just don't care. A lot of open tables with long wait"
0,"I really like the food at Grimaldi's and the service in the dining area has always been excellent.\n However, service in the bar area is disappointing at best. It's a regular spot for me and my clients simply due to location. But I'm not sure I will frequent it again. After repeatedly receiving horrible service, I think I will find another spot where my business is appreciated.\n The past 3 times I was there, the bartender girls ignored me. I was seated at the bar with clients. I had to yell across the bar to order a glass of wine. we had 3 drinks each and each time I had to get her attention this way to get a drink. Not once did she ask- \"" Would you like another drink?\"" Also, I had to fight to get her attention just to get refills on water too.\nWhat really bothers me is that this is a service oriented business. We are great tippers. I'm in a business where good service is handsomely rewarded. Do the bartenders there not realize this? \nI'll never go there again. Either management needs to step up their game and train these girls properly or risk losing regular customers."

1,"It's been nearly forever since I've been in a Hallmark.  Very nice store and helpful staff but I was surprised to see a small section of the store for greeting cards and a whole lot of other stuff.  Fortunately, I was looking for \""other stuff\""   Found some beautiful packages of not cards although not the traditionally embossed kind I wanted but still cool.  \n\nI was kind of in a rush so didn't look around but really want a new fountain pen!

1,"Had a gyro, and is one of the best ones I've ever had. I'm from Chicago so I'm critical when it comes to gyros, beefs, pizza and hot dogs. Still have to try the other foods here though."
0,"This was just ok. I got the steakhouse salad, which came with four pieces of meat the size of quarters. I'm sorry, but that's no $13 salad. I had to send it back, because I asked for the meat to be cooked through and it was rare.\n\nMy dining partner said her pizza was tasteless.\n\nIt was very loud.\n\nIn all, it was too much money for what we got. We won't go back."
0,"I received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel. She loved a specific salad and thought I might enjoy the restaurant. I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was. \n\nThe entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home. \n\nThe manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing. \n\nI left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again. It was definitely below the level of a good restaurant. Below fair as well. I guess this means poor."
1,"\""Awww yeeaah!\""\n\nI know. I'm so out of touch with catch phrases and hip sayings. Ah well. At least I know a nice bar when I see one.\n\nVesper definitely treated us well as we chose this bar/lounge to kick start our evening activities during my BFF's '29 and still dayum fine' birthday weekend. Tasty, quality drinks in a beautiful setting with my bestie made for a fun evening."
0,The club sucks... tiny dance floor and expensive drinks... get your party on for free downstairs. The music is better and there is a lot of room to sit and chill with friends  =)
1,"One of the best pools in Vegas. Always a party!\n\nEven on the days where there is nothing special going on.\n\nMusic is loud. Crowd is fun (but not crazy wild like other places).\n\nOnly problem is that it gets really busy so waitress service sometimes can be VERY slow. \n\nStill my favorite though for regular days (aka: non holiday weekends, non special events - on those days it's too dam crazy)"
0,"Took the better half to 43 north and had what I considered to be just an OK meal. For the price I have to say I was disappointed. We started off with beef Carpaccio. I was surprised by how thick they cut the beef. Typically, Its cut much thinner. Also, there didn't seem to be much flavor. I'm not sure if they seasoned the meat or not. For dinner I had chicken and the better half had duck. The duck tasted very gamey to me. I did enjoy the service. The experience wasn't bad, it's just for the money you have a lot better choices in Madison."

0,"Ew.  All I can say is ew.   I want to preface this review with the concession that I have only been here three times.  I am going to harshly criticize the barrista I had on my last two visits, and I recognize that others may be better.  But she deserves to be mentioned, and I think that I am not the only one that had this problem.\n\nOk, so I went in on Labor Day. I get it, she wanted to be at home with her bestie drinking a margarita by the pool.  I would have preferred that myself, but I had a huge test on Tuesday morning, and I was using my day off to study.\n\nI order a coffee.  I ask for a large Americano.  She puts a large paper cup in front of me and I ask her if I could have it in a ceramic cup, I'm staying and I don't want to use the resources.  She tells me that she doesn't have any clean cups.   I am the only one in line, so I tell her that I don't mind waiting, I will sit down and get situated, and she can wash one. She points to the room behind me, and tells me that it's Labor Day, she is alone in here and it's packed.\n\nOk, lady. I get it.  Full house.  But everyone is drinking their coffee, there is no crazy line at the counter.  There is no line at all at the counter. I can only assume that if you are out of cups, the very first thing you are going to do when I walk away is wash some.  I am letting you know that I am willing to wait. \n\nBut I don't say this, I say, \""There are ceramic cups right behind you.\""  \""Those are mediums,\"" she says.  \""You ordered a large.\""  She is really, really not getting the big picture.  I just want a damn coffee in a freaking ceramic cup, so I can feel civilized while not making a bigger carbon footprint in the process and study for my anatomy exam.\n\n\""That's fine\"" I say, \""I will have it in a medium cup.\""  She gives me a quarter back, which is apparently the difference between ad large and a medium.  Turns out choosing the medium cup was a mistake, apparently Lola bought her coffee cups based on style, not function.  They are ridiculously wide and shallow,. so it's kind of like moving a huge saucer to your lips trying to slosh some coffee into your face. I used about five napkins trying to wipe up the coffee that spilled all over the table (so much for not wasting paper) when I tried to set it down.  It tasted terrible, probably due to the horrible taste in my mouth left over from dealing with the barrista-from-hell.  \n\nSo after finally settling in, I realize that this is the worst place in the world to study. Or to sit, or to read, or to talk to someone.   Too tall, no sound absorbers, I can hear every single thing being said around me.   I don't know how to descibe it other than bad energy in there, kind of...uptight.  Like everyone else felt as uncomfortable as I did. \n\nI actually got up and left a full cup of coffee (minus what spilled).  The whole thing was just so bad, I wanted to get the hell out of there.    Even though it is right down the street from me, and it looks beautiful, I will never, ever go back in."
1,I LOVED the baguette sandwich!  The bread was perfect. One hell of a deal for such a big sandwich. The tomato mozzarella salad was also great.
1,"After living on DD coffee and donuts for a decade in New England, I was disappointed to find very few locations in the Burgh! However this one in Market Square is plenty good. It can get crowded in the mornings when there is a lot of office rush or maybe on the weekends but the staff get the people moving pretty quick. \n\nBeing decently sized, this location offers some seating space (however DD is not much of a sit down coffee joint). I stick with the regular coffee (hot) or the iced coffee. The Vanilla Chai has usually been good but lacks consistency in its making. As this is a chain, I am not going to get into details on the food items but don't forget your munchkins/donuts if you are from California. Also you can get your K-Cups from this place and use your DD app to pay for purchases. I do believe they have free wifi but never really used it.\n\nParking is a pain, being Market Square, but I will roll with the punches as I continue to \""run on DD.\"""
0,"All the shit I've gone through with this place, first it relocated and is not easy to find, 2nd when I do find it its during the holidays and its closed and now........I walked in the door 5 minutes after 4 and asked if they still served th lunch special-1 meat 1 side for $5.\n\nThey said no-the rest of the menu is way overpriced, this place is in the sleaziest neighborhood right behind Little Darlings nudie bar.so i left\n\nI never ate here but to me it's not worth it-no wonder the cook is packing heat."
0,"*Please make note that this review contains information about a salon not providing me with services that I paid for. Please proceed with caution when dealing with them*\n\nAlso, the owner wrote a note questioning the validity of my review based on negative reviews (completely ignoring the positive ones), but if you look at the review for his store, no one who gave that place a good score has more than a few reviews outside of one person. OBVIOUSLY, he's a scammer. \n\nPlease forgive the one star above, this isn't a zero star system otherwise I gladly would have awarded this wreck of a salon one, or none as the case may be. \n\nFirst, the complaints about attitudes and inexperience are spot on. They have NO idea what they're doing at this salon.\n\nI was a member of a different salon (note: these are franchised so they have no accountability to a corporate office which explains that extreme lack of professionalism) and came over to this one as it was closer to my house. \n\nI asked about specials and packages when I first came in and they explained them to me. I then chose a 12-session package for a little over $100. They told me that this gave me any choice of bed that I wanted. \n\nThe first time I went in everything went relatively smoothly, except they charge you for the tanning canister that is required for you to be able to tan. What was I paying for then? Whatever. I tanned in a bed and then did the spray tan (a ritual I repeated each and every time I went in).\n\nThe second time I went in everything went south. They had no idea about my sessions, etc. They eventually 'figured it out' and I went on my way, repeating the steps above - two tans, etc. \n\nEvery single time after that no one could figure out what was going on. I would stand there for 10 minutes waiting to tan while they figured my account out, AGAIN. I have no idea why this happened, and personally, it wasn't my problem. As a consumer with disposable income in this economy I have a right to not have any screw ups when I go to do something as decadent as tanning (and as simple). Forget it, that was never going to happen.\n\nPlease repeat the above for the third time.\n\nThe fourth time I went in and tanned fine, although the check-in routine stayed the same - confusion, confusion, solution. The spray tan didn't go so well and malfunctioned. Which, by the way, used to happen a lot with this machine, it seemed old. Anyway, the girl gave me a credit on my account so now I had five sessions left (this is important).\n\nThe fifth time I went in must have been a bad day for someone because the girl that helped me had a serious attitude problem. So much so that when I came out I told her that I didn't appreciate the way she treated me (that's really unusual for me - I believe in politeness at all costs and had shown it consistently with a place that could NEVER get my account right and cost me time constantly). Anyway.\n\nFor my sixth visit I called first to verify the amount of tans I had and to make an appointment to go in. Someone named Barbie answer the phone and AGAIN went into the computer and couldn't find ANYTHING for me. She said I must have used all of my tans. I said even if that was the case I'd still have one extra left from the time when the spray machine didn't work. She said 'sorry, there's nothing here.' \n\nOkay, all patience has almost run out. I told her that I am positive that she is the person I spoke with who said all this was fixed. She then said to me (verbatim), well I don't know if you came in when I wasn't in...' I stopped her, laughing incredulously, and said 'did you just imply that I stole something?' She then said I was rude and slammed down the phone. REALLY? REALLY? \n\nSo, after that display of complete unprofessionalism, I call back and speak with Karenna. She tells me she somehow heard the whole conversation and that I was the rude one (right, I accused you of stealing?). She then proceeded to tell me (after Barbie, in our initial conversation admitted knowing who I was) that I had never been a member there, had never tanned there and had never paid them any money. Stop, I know. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone, too!\n\nSo, how much further could I have gone with this? It wasn't like I could get into their computer and prove anything. They get to keep my money without giving me the services I paid for, and because they are the final word, I get screwed.\n\nWhatever you do, don't tan here. They are unethical and management will TELL you that they're franchised and if you have a complaint it will just come back to him, implying nothing will be done to them. Yikes. BAD BUSINESS."
0,"out of all the clubs in Vegas- i seriously dislike this one the most. the DJ sucks, the drinks are outrageously disgusting, the crowd is LAME and full of skeevy locals, the decor is confused, the separated rooms are unnecessary and a bit confusing, the bathroom is too small for a club in Vegas, etc. etc. \n\ni don't know if they're trying to pack everyone in there like sardines, but i really did not enjoy being in there. way too many people stomping on my tired lil feet in heels. the lighting gets a little too intense and i had to look away in order to stay focused on walking to the bar. haha. the promoters and security here is a complete JOKE on Saturday nights. the bottle service rooms are simply boring and kind of insulting. like, WTF? i want to sit in this dark room and the decor is sooo freakin' dark/ugly/tasteless... hells no. i'll never go back."
0,I live in the area near Retro Bakery.  I stopped in a couple times for cupcakes.  I tried 4 or 5 different flavors.  They're ok.  Way too sweet for my liking.  All their cake taste pretty much the same.  The super sweet buttercream is what has the different flavors.  I've had better.  But their service was great.  Very nice people and very helpful.
0,"The last 3 trips to cold stone have left me with an overpriced, freezer burned, uneatable cup of \"" I am never going here again\"" the kids convinced me to go back times 2 and 3, but never again."
0,"I took my dad to the resturant a couple months ago and the first time for him was a good experiance.  the second day we went back it was not so good experiance.  So I have waited a couple months to go back and may never go back again.  We watied forever to get our food, about 45 min, when i approached the hostess to check she said no, this nice young waiter said he would, and poof it was out.  Not to mention they were still wrapping the silverware by grabing the fork by the prongs and not the bottom part, big health violation.  When i did get my order the waitress gave me the wrong bagel and she forgot the home fries.  I am seeing a pattern that one should sit in the male waiter section because they are not bitchy.  It is sad for the waitresses, because i have been know to tip a 100% of my bill since breakfast is so reasonable.  I don't think the owners and managers that the attitude of the young ladies is so poor and that reflects badly on the resturant.  I don't think i will go back to this one for a long time."
0,"The outside of the hotel looks a lot more promising than the inside. It was dingy & empty, like all the other hotels on this part of the Strip. The arcade smelled like mildew & made me want to gag. The theme is good for families with small children, but nothing to brag about."
1,"Oh so good!  I get take out from these guys every week or so and have never been disappointed.  I'm a creature of habit and am addicted to their chicken burrito.  My husband loves their twin chimis.  It's a little hole in the wall restaurant with hardly any seating, but they consistently deliver great food which is not something every restaurant can claim."
0,"My husband and I went there last night for a date. The music was very loud. I'm good with music, but I would like to be able to talk to my date across the table. \n\nThe service was acceptable. I have nothing to complain about or praise. \n\nThe food was not worth the price. We didn't even finish most of our plates. I love the tapas style and trying multiple dishes. The pork belly was the only good part of the meal. We also had the guacamole with pomegranates and street corn which were alright. The pad Thai, ahi tacos, and the roll we had (had mango salsa on it) were not very good.  \n\nI will not be hurrying back to SumoMaya."
0,"Hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh. Appalling \nservice, I went there with 6 people, restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by. The lounge was empty, was there from 8-11 she didn't check on us once, we had to flag her down , complained to the manager with no response. NYC prices as well, very embarrassed for the big burrito company."
0,"I will say I haven't had some horrific experience here, however due to the prices I won't be going back.  \nMy first visit I took in about 10+ items in for dry cleaning and laundering, which cost me around $150. I expected it to be a bit pricey, but considering I used a coupon I'd say they are outrageous. \nEven then I'm the type of person who is willing to pay a little extra for good quality-- So the rating really reflects just how over priced their services are. \nToday I went to pick up three items I had dropped off for alterations las\nt week; my total came to $66.75! (And that was after a discount of $22.25) \nWhen I had dropped them off I specifically asked how much it would cost and at that time they said they weren't able to give me an amount. \nI can say the tailoring itself looks really nice, but I would have only had one pair done if I had known how much it was going to be. As for the \""alterations\"" I don't really feel I got what I ask\nDefinitely not happy with the prices or the quality for the price paid. -B"
0,"The food wasn't bad and the service was great. My problem lies with the owner who seated us and the way he spoke to the waitress cleaning the table so we could sit down. I don't know if she wasn't moving fast enough for him or what but he barked at her and she said \""almost done\"" and then he commenced to chewing her out and said \""keep your mouth shut and clean the table\"". I almost turned around and left but we wanted breakfast.\n\nThis is no way to speak to your employees and I was waiting for John Quinones to come out and ask \""what would you do?\""."
1,The Cheesesteaks are always delicious.  I just tried the Garlic Fires and they were great!   Leave your calories counter at home though...
0,"So last night my girl and I went to pick up some food. She always gets the same thing. Bean and cheese burrito with adding sliced avocado. The counter help Martin said they can't do that! We say well all the others do. And he says \"" I'm not going to put up with this\"" we were shocked!! If I was 25 I would of dragged him over the counter but I'm better than that!! This is not what customer service should be!!! Failed Martin!!!"
0,"This is the black hole of Qdobi, after which you will be asking yourself why you didn't hold out for the friendly service, authentic cuisine, and upscale atmosphere of Taco Bell.\n\nBy the time you're done here, you'll feel the sort of existential despair that's shared only by staff in the Sears shoe department. The place is always empty-ish, always reeking of desperation, always cluttered with a slow-moving line (even if you're the only customer, there will somehow be a slow-moving line), and always fundamentally bland and mediocre, with small portions, too.\n\nIt's not even really cheap, other than by comparison to the Scottsdale prices surrounding it. You probably will not die of eating here, but count on having real doubts about whether life is worth living. Also: do not order the pulled pork. It's vile."
1,"FIX is an excellent restaurant. Beautifully designed with delicious food and drinks. If the food is excellent but the service is horrible, it just makes the experience a bitter taste in your mouth. I've read and heard horrible reviews about FIX due to its staff. \nLuckily for us we had TOM! He was adorably handsome, professional and attentive. We made reservations through the Light Group for a pre-fix bachelorette party dinner. Tom explained everything in detail and answered any questions we had on the menu. He made a great recommendation of a cucumber martini that we still rave about. The Kobe Burgers and Mac&Cheese sticks just melt in your mouth. \n\nI have to be honest though, I recommended FIX to my husband when the guys went out to Vegas for the Bachelor Party and they had an awful experience... the server was a complete arrogant a-hole. \nThe next day I recieved a very nice handwritten card from Tom thanking us for our visit... I showed my husband and told him, \""See, I told you to ask for Tom. I told him I was recommending the place to you.\"""
1,Ordered 1/4 white box for lunch.  Also ordered gizzards to share with my party (not the most popular party gift).  \n\nFive stars for chicken- delicious and moist. Possibly the best fried chicken I have ever had.\n\nFive stars for tots- great texture and taste.\n\nFive stars for the price. One of many good and economical lunches in Charlotte. In Phoenix (home) it seems like chain fast food is the only way to eat lunch under $10.\n\nFour stars for the slaw\n\nThree stars for hush puppies. Dry and not much taste.\n\nThree stars for gizzards- too light on the breading for my taste.\n\nI will be back but stay clear of gizzards.
1,"Absolutely the best burger in Las Vegas... or quite possibly in the US?\n\nMost of my experience comes from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've tried dozens of places, if not hundreds, from cheap burger joints to upscale restaurants. Like Umami Burger, Roam Artisan Burgers, 4505 Meats, Mission Beach Cafe, SuperDuper, Chow, Marlowe, or even Spruce... Some of them were fantastic, but Bachi goes even further. My wife agrees.\n\nI don't know what makes us addicted to their burgers, but I'm pretty sure they put some kind of cocaine in the ingredients. We need to blow a whistle to invite DEA to stop this madness. But before doing that, please allow me to have one last bite of the Miyagi-san burger... or the Kiki burger... or the Ronin burger... or the Just Fries... oh please help me!"
1,"Zaba's is close to my work, and I go here fairly often for lunch. I really like Zaba's quesadillas. They come with a big side of guac, sour cream, and salsa (I suggest the tomatillo salsa). It's always yummy. I'm not a huge fan of the burritos as I don't like rice in them. You can get it without the rice, but then your burrito is really thin as they don't put anything in to replace the rice. The tacos are pretty decent. My suggestion: Get the quesadilla, skip the burrito."
1,Hands down the best donuts in Madison.  I love the chocolate cake donuts.  I work only a few blocks from there and drive past it going to/from work.  It takes a lot of self control not to stop there :P
0,"I've been here a bunch and I want to continue supporting this place, I really do. But they make it nearly impossible. The kitchen staff works hard and the food is OK. But the wait staff is often inattentive at best and surly at worst. (Example: the host refused to seat our party at an empty table in the no-smoking section and insisted we sit adjacent to the loud, nasty bar section.)  After several such unpleasant experiences, I've given up."
0,"Feb 2011\n\nGot in late around midnight. Had to pony up $130 for bottle service each. Our table was atrocious: in the main hallway! Geez... Our hostess was gorgeous and she definitely spiked the mood up. But going back and forth to dance floor was painful. The dancefloor itself was full of a**holes, got several drinks spilled on my Hugo shirt. \n\nWe drank the Grey Goose and got the f outta there. \n\nIn 2010 this was a better experience. I won't be back for a while I think."
0,The incompetence of the employees forces me to question how anything gets shipped at all...
1,"Really good service.  James at the bar made some really good recommendations. The place is right next to Pizzeria Bianco.  So while you wait for a table there, come here for a drink and kick it.\n\nThey also have a great wine menu, if you're into that.  I guess on Fridays they have a live band playing inside."
1,"Ok, now the niche of this restaurant is what Los Angeles is desperately to \""cool\"" to try\n\n\nThe menu is explained to you and leaves you with a plethora of options to customize your dining experience. \n\n\nBurgushi: Who the hell would have ever thought? I didnt try it because I absolutely fell in LOVE with the Turkey apple brie and cranberry burger which I F$&ked my mouth with twice on my last visit. Its unbelievable to witness the flavor that will burst into your mouth and nearly knock you out of your seat. \n\n\nFried pickles - my FAV for several reasons but most importantly that I didnt spend the next 5 min extracting vegetable oil from them to eat. \n\n\nDesign your own sushi roll = BRILLIANT concept that I have YET to see in any other metropolitan area.\n\n\nThe only thing that disappoints me is the location. I mean after all, location is everything and this wonderful gem seems lodged in the gregarious blunder also known as the south park mall. Where people are just bred differently. \n\n\nAll in all I promise to visit this place each and EVERY time I return to Charlotte no matter what.\n\n\nP.S. Make sure you wash you hands and LISTEN to the overhead messaged being played. Nothing says HAPPINESS like a little humor before you leave.."
0,"Had dinner here with some friends. This place is not the cleanest restaurant in town. The floor was sticky when we walked into our booth. We sat down and was greeted by the server. He brought our waters while waiting to order and one of our water glasses was dirty, it had dis colored water in it. My friends ordered food. I didn't. While waiting for our dish we observed the server saving the lettuce that our neighboring table did not use and placed it on the side. I am hoping they are not reusing side dishes that are not eaten by their guests. I don't think I'll be back to this place. I gave it two stars because my friends that did order say that their Korean food was fair and edible."
1,"Great sandwiches. But if you do not order ahead, plan on a wait and a hard time parking.  With the hospital across the street, it is a very popular place.\n\nIf you can order ahead or go at an off time, you will be so happy.  I very rarely switch up my order, but everything I've had I like.  I usually get the Encore (hot roast beef with peppers and feta sauce).  It is a little bit of heaven on a roll."
1,"We tried the Rosarito, Monterey and the Berry Delight. All were very good, perfect portion size and delicious. I had a blood orange mimosa which was more champagne then juice, which is fine by me. Not sure I'd order it again with the blood orange.  The staff was friendly and efficient. We will be back!"
1,"Best Vietnamese in town! I used to live in Laos, and visited Vietnam a number of times. This place is a great memory lane for me. Really quick service, cozy feeling dining hall. I have never done the buffet, I always order strictly Viet food from the menu and have never been let down."
1,"The dog park is located in the Waterfront Park on the Southside just under the Birmingham Bridge.  There is a small and big dogs section. The small dog section still has nice grass, but the large dog area is well trampled.  New woodchips would go a long way.  \n\nThere are plenty of benches boasting nice views of the river and city.  \n\nI have not seen any dog fights yet and most owners seem very responsible. Occasionally, someone brings their grocery bags from home and water bottles and bowls, just in case you forgot yours. \n\nFinally, there is a pleasant trail where I take my dog down to the Hot Metal Bridge. Haufbrau Hauss is down there, but you cannot take your dog into the biergartenn :(  \n\nAll in all, a few cosmetic touches and a dog bag dispenser would take this place to a five star level. An additional bonus would be one of those anerobic digesters/street lamps that creates light from dog poo."
0,Not the place I go when I want good Indian food.
1,"I had another butter burger with cheddar and you know what, its pretty good. They are certainly better than that shit known as In n Out. The fries are actually very good as well. I am a fan."
1,"Every Saturday, the Peelers perform at 11pm. As for cover bands they are entertaining. Not only do they span all genres, but they do mash ups as well. The crowd is older, but the atmosphere is fun. \n\nDrinks are not crazy expensive and certain bartenders make it worth the price. Most drinks will run you $8 for a basic alcohol plus mixer combo. \n\nFinding a seat is difficult because they fill up quickly. Getting there early is not a big deal since the band is good. They were thoroughly entertaining."
1,"This is the Starbucks that is inside the Target on Sky Pointe Drive. It's a very small Starbucks, even by in-store standards; however seems to have a fair selection of snacks, mugs and accompanying Starbo swag. \nI'm embarrassed to admit that I used to avoid the Target this Starbucks is in, specifically for their lack of caffeinated franchise-y goodness. But now Starbucks is here, as well as a newly opened grocery department, and there can be much rejoicing!\nThey frequently have just one employee working at this location and there's definitely a wait sometimes. I also think there might be some supply issues to work out as they were out of lemonade last week, which I rarely come across at other locations. BUT the barista who was working was super friendly and recommended I try strawberry juice (who knew they had that!!?) in the place of lemonade in my passion tea. She then made samples for myself and other patrons to try. Oh yum!!! It might be my new favorite summer treat. Starbucks- you rule, as usual!"
0,"Went here for drinks on a Saturday night and the place was not extremely busy but for some reason it was like pulling teeth to have my beer filled.  Maybe the bartenders were having an off night but after 5 minutes of the bartenders walking by i had to flag them down for a cocktail.  \n\nWe ordered 12 of the boneless wings that came out extremely quickly...maybe 2 quickly.  The chicken totaly dry, the sauce didn't even seem present.  Perhaps said chicken had been from a previous order or cooked before ordered. \n\nIf you're just looking for a place to watch a game and do not care about service, food, and drinks this would be a great choice as they did have many games on."
0,"If you want good Dim Sum, drive a little farther and go to Las Vegas Chinatown.  They were located on S Hualapai Wy/Twain in Las Vegas.  They are open 7 days a week from 7am-4pm.\n\nWhen I walked in, there were about a dozen employees standing  behind the counter for a staff huddle.  One gal seated me and a another guy brought me water.  \n\nThey had 3 small flat screen tvs and 5 fish tanks.  The booths were really hard.  They didn't have much cushion to them.  Where I was seated, I could hear the kitchen staff and the servers behind me talking and hanging out.\n\nThey had nice laminated menus.  The only problem was that they didn't have enough menus.  A woman tried to pick up my menu after I ordered.  But I wanted to hang on to it in case I wanted to order more.\n\nThey offered 15 Dim Sum options, breakfast, salads, sandwiches, noodles, fish, From the Wok, and soups.  I ordered 4 Dim Sum dishes.\n\nFried Calamari ($6.50):  There were 9 lightly breaded rings of calamari served on a saucer plate.  The server asked if I wanted sweet and sour, hoisin, hot chili, or soy sauce.  I choose sweet and sour sauce.  It was served in a little plastic container.  It was watery.\n\nStuffed Mushrooms ($3.50):  There were 4  piping hot mushrooms stuffed with tasteless ground shrimp and calamari served on a saucer plate.\n\nThe server brought me hoisin and hot chili sauce in a little plastic container, and a bottle of soy sauce for the dumplings.\n\nPork Shiu Mai ($2.50):  4 pieces served on a saucer plate.  They were filled with ground pork and mushrooms.\n\nSteamed Pork Dumplings ($3): 3 dumplings served on a saucer plate.  These were the best out of the 4 items I ordered.\n\nThey could at least invest in proper serving plates, offer chopsticks, and have little jars of condiments on the table.  They need a website and a Facebook page.\n\nI paid at the counter and left. Paying $18 with tip was way too much for what I got.   I won't be back."
1,Loved the sandwiches.  Great service and homemade tiramisu to die for.  Ambience fits the local area.  Full service bar. Cute place to hang out.
1,"This restaurant location has changed hands several times recently.  It was Dragon Island then Big Heng.  It's now just \""Dragon\"".   It was purchased by a cook from San Francisco.  The restaurant was clean and cheery.  Nothings changed at all since the turn-over in that respect.  The lunch special menu had over 30 choices rangeing in price from 4.50 up to 6.00.  They all come with soup and egg roll or a salad and rice.  The egg drop soup wasn't my favorite but someone with me thought it was delicious.  I ordered the Cilantro Chicken which I hadn't ever even heard of.  It was very good.  A love cilantro and it was loaded with it and assorted veggies.  We had loved Big Heng for take-out and this is in our neighborhood so hopefully all the dishes are as good."
1,"Rooster's Uptown continues to satisfy and impress on several levels.\n\nThe upstairs ambience is a favorite part of this restaurant. If you can be seated in a booth closer to the door leading to the bathroom, you can feel more private - which I prefer. \n\nThe staff I've dealt with during my last 3 visits has been knowledgeable, helpful and agreeable.\n\nOne of the lighting devices was aimed uncomfortably into our eyes (possibly from being cleaned), so we asked, and a server climbed up and re-directed it for us right then.\n\nThe food is fresh and tasty, and the servers tend to give detailed descriptions and answer questions in a professional fashion. I have always trusted their recommendations, and am always satisfied.\n\nMy order generally consists of a charcuterie plate with a bresaola and something close to prosciutto (I ask which current meat is closest to it), then 2 cheeses - also depending on the recommendation of the server and what they are featuring. Depending on appetite, a Barbee arugula with apples & chevre salad and maybe another item can suffice for two. Again, the special salad and meats must be taken into consideration. These often make the meal.\n\nThe drink menu is designed to appeal to specific tastes and is manageable. The Queen's Cup - a play on the Pimm's Cup - can even be made with vodka per request."
1,Can't imagine why this great place has only three stars!  Two of us shared an Italian Chopped Salad and it was delicious.  One of the best I have ever eaten.  Service was very good - price was more than reasonable.  \n\nWe will be back!!
0,"I saw the mention in that book-- was it \""The Best Pizza in America\"" or somesuch?-- and since I was living pretty nearby at the time I dragged my sister out to get in line at 4pm or so.\n\nThe pizza was most definitely not amazing, stupendous, or even particularly impressive.  It wasn't horrible, it wasn't inedible, but it wasn't worth the hype and it was not worth the wait.\n\nI would give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 stars, but it gets worse thanks to the atmosphere.  My sister and I chose what we were going to order and she excused herself for the restroom, and the waiter came over while she was away.  He made it quite clear that I had one chance to order and I would not be able to make any changes or additions once he put the order in.  Between that and the hectic din and the general sense that this place was all that and a slice of pizza, I was sort of let down.\n\nAs someone else here pointed out, though, the bar next door was actually quite nice.  Pleasant atmosphere and definitely more relaxed.  We chatted with the bartender for a time before we realized that we needed to get in line to get our name on The List so we could come back to the bar.  Hmmm.\n\nI say take the time you would spend waiting on line for Bianco and spend it with friends and family at your favorite local pizza joint."
1,"Gio and co. were amazing to us tonight! We had a group that literally filled the restaurant, and they were fantastic. Everything we tried was exceptional. The standouts for me were the Vegas to Italy pizza, the chicken and potatoes and the ziti. I can't say enough about that ziti!  I thought the hard boiled eggs would make it taste weird, but it was super! I also can't say enough about the atmosphere and the service. Definitely 5 stars on all fronts."
0,"Please explain to me the rationale behind having a happy hour that is limited to the bar or outside patio when there are only three (count them on one hand) three customers in the entire place?  The entire restaurant is small and I could hold the hand of the person sitting at the bar while I sit in the restaurant section,  yet, I am not allowed to benefit from the happy hour menu for my drink. If you want to split hairs over this one, you can do it with someone else.  I will not be spending my money on a place that is petty."
0,"Hey, I take part of the blame for this review......Lesson learned, when you walk in a restaurant that primarily serves hot dogs, order a hot dog.\n\nI just left Chicago Dogs after having one of their $8.00 burgers.  At the suggestion of the waiter/cashier I went with the burger, fries and drink special which cashed me out at ten dollars and change.  Add a $1.00 tip in the jar and the total was about $11.50.\n\nThe timeliness of the service from order to eating was very good; however, quality may have been trumped for timeliness.  Once the burger was delivered I noticed the top of the bun was cool (which in this case may have been room temperature since I needed a jacket to dine here).  I then noticed the preformed \""Angus\"" patty (which I can buy at Costco) between a store-bought bun.  \n\nAt this point, let me explain to all burger peddlers my Burger Ratings Formula.  All burgers start with a \""10\"" rating (10 being the best).  If a burger is served with a  store bought bun, -2 points.  If the meat is a preformed, previously frozen, store bought patty, -2 points.  Cold or cool bun, -2 points.\n\nBack to Chicago Dogs........Unfortunately, before I even bit into this burger it had a rating of 4.......but, I was willing to be oooooooed and awwwwwwwed by what was between the sterile beef patty and the bun.  Again, unfortunately I was not.  My mouth met with dill pickles, dill peppers, diced (what I think was) bell pepper, one slice of tomato, and one lonely ring of onion.  If these are the type of flavors that \""blow your skirt up\"" on a hamburger then more power to ya........but it wasn't for me.  Put these same condiments with a fresh ground beef patty and a warm specialty bun, and I may sing a different tune.\n\nThe fries appeared fresh cut and were quite good.  Unfortunately, when I grabbed for the ketchup for some dipping and mopping the greasy plastic red dispenser was empty. I glanced at the two tables next to me an noticed that the ketchup dispensers were also nearly empty.  This gave rise to the thought, \""How long has the ketchup been in these bottles?\""  I ate the fries dry.\n\nOn my departure, the waiter/cashier asked me how the burger was.  I mentioned that the bun was cold.  He replied, \""That's strange.\""  I wanted to offer more of my good information to help him and his business improve on this American staple but he never said anything else.  As I turned and began to walk out I said, \""Thank you.\""   He said nothing. I guess i hurt his feelings with the cold bun comment.  He need  not worry, I won't be back."
1,"I literally could NOT STOP EATING! I ordered the Chenna Batura, otherwise, curried garbanzo beans with puffy bread or even easier, #33. It was so satisfying that I ordered a second one to go so I could take it home and indulge over the weekend. The decor and ambiance was not the greatest, but really, who cares when the food is to die for. I will be making this my official \""Place to go when I can not decided what I want to eat\"" because I know it will always be satisfying no matter what type of food I am in the mood for."
1,"I am a fan of Ice Cream! There is really no other place near me (that I know of) that is a good place to go and just get Ice Cream (yogurt aside), so that is why I am reviewing a Cold Stone!  I really do like their Ice Cream too!  I always get the cheesecake fantasy or whatever its called, but it is by far my favorite!  We come here and it is always good, service is always the same, the place is clean and there is never a wait (or a long wait)  I love the creations they have and my kids love em too."
1,"My first experience at this chain... I usually try to eat local when traveling but my partner wanted to eat here. The service was absolutely some of the best I have ever. Our server was Matt, he knew the menu forward and back and even offered us an appetizer that wasn't on the menu, blacked alligator, crazy good. The food was great as well, I ordered the Caribbean lobster tail, it was huge and very flavorful. We did have one mix up with the kitchen but Matt explained the situation and handled it. One of the best dining experiences ever. Check them out, and ask for Matt, you won't be disappointed."
1,LOVE THEIR FOOD.\n\nthe service is great too :)
0,"I've gotta agree with the poor reviews.  My wife and I went on a Saturday around lunch.  \n\nTwo years ago we were in Manhattan for their San Gennaro festival.  I didn't go in expecting this to compare but I was surprised at the stark contrast.\n\nI was expensive!  Even with the coupon it was $12 to get in.  $9 for a poor sausage and pepper sandwich (we didn't finish it). $10 for two beers.  The way I look at it I paid $31 to get dusty and realize I was in the wrong place.  Shoulda spent it on boxing a trifecta!\n\nThe one diamond was the old sweet Italian man that was wandering around the food court singing.  He didn't sing to us but we chatted with him for a minute.  Boy he had the sweetest smile.  Reminded me of my Pop pop.\n\nI'm would never go on a carnie ride, I guess I am just chicken, so I came here for the Italian experience and food.  I always feel badly for the animals too.\n\nThere is zero \""Italian experience\"" to be had and unfortunately it looks like we just picked a bad vendor.  I saw some people carrying around some great looking food.  Then again, our sausage and peppers LOOKED great.\n\nThe singer when I was there was laughably bad.  Khaki docker pants, white sneakers, black shirt, and a voice that fit only a mother could love.  Looked like a Seinfeld outfit from the 90's.  Sounds like some other people got to enjoy some better acts.  He wasn't one of the \""headliners\"".\n\nA big part of the turn off was the dirt lot the event was held on.  I try to go to a lot of festivals, I really like browsing around, but this one just fell flat.  A different location might bring a tiny bit of much needed class to this event.\n\nGood thing that Turf Paradise is a short walk away.  Had fun there!"
1,I was in a bikini contest here and had a blast! The only thing I didn't like is I had to go through like three security checks when getting in... Kind of ridiculous.
1,"I would give this place all the stars, but we had some issues regarding our room keys, as well as dealing with the front desk staff.  Besides that, the service was great!  The best part about the Vdara and the surrounding casinos in the area is its location!  Sandwiched right in the middle of the strip, you have everything you want (two malls, casinos, nightlife, etc) and still retreat to the hotel after you've had your fill and need to replenish your strength (2hr naps suffice) to start the madness all over again.\n\nValet staff is dope, bell services were dope, housekeeping was dope, room service food was delicious, but we just had an issue with the front desk with our keys.  My brother ended his night early at 2am on one night, and he had to wait an hour downstairs to get back into our room.  Our second issue with front desk was when we were looking for a lost item in the room. We were asked to wait in the lobby while they made the necessary phone call to security to check, the male at the desk never got back to us on our query, even when there no longer were lines of people who needed servicing.  When I had gone back up to the desk and asked the lady working next to him to please follow up, she got us our help in less than 5 minutes.  All this while the first worker was listening, he didn't even bother to acknowledge that he helped me previously.\n\nThe panoramic suite that we had was awesome!  I wish it was my apartment, just not in Vegas, if that was the case, I'd probably be in a lot of trouble every weekend, hopefully not every night.  The one other thing I did not like was that the pool was unavailable due to construction the weekend we were there, we should have had some of the hotel fees reflect that.  All in all, I would still return here because I really do like the fact that Vdara is a Hotel Resort and not a Casino Resort."
1,"I've been to Vegas many times, and stayed both on the strip, and off the strip. The Golden Nugget, by far, has been my favourite place to go to.. it's very much a home away from home for us.. Yea, its off the strip.. and I LOVE it.. Not as many drunken frat boys, with backwards baseball hats yelling \""wooooo wooooo\""!! Granted, it gets more and more like that, towards the evening, when the light show thing starts happening.. (which I find completely dumb, but whatever gets the masses to stare at the ceiling and drool, because some various lights are going on and off makes them happy, more power to the drones!) \n\nAnyways, back to the golden nugget.. I love this place. We booked the Gold tower room.. the TV in the bathroom mirror RULES.. nothing like doing my morning business and being able to watch C-Span.. Also, the room, which I thought was going to be a touch bigger, is still great. The bed is comfy.. Its just a very nice and relaxing room.\n\nThe pool was great.. However, be careful of floating vomit.. No, seriously.. I swam into it once.. and how is it that with how many people were in that pool, no one noticed some drunk person BARFING in the pool.. Yuck! \n\nBesides the above incident, I love this place.. They treat you well there.. We decided on staying an extra night. We are planning another trip there this summer. I cant wait."
0,"The customer service phone numbers are terrible, hold times very long, aging 747 fleet on the PHX-LHR route means frequent delays for technical reasons.  Used to be my favorite airline, now I'd rather fly with anyone else. Huge restrictions on using Avios points, then tiny seats with limited seat pitch.  As I type this I have been on hold to speak to an agent for 30+ minutes.  Time for them to go out of business and let a customer-centric airline take over these routes.\n\nUPDATE: It finally took me TWO HOURS on the phone to make a change to my flight working with an agent, constantly being placed on hold.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE customer service!!!  If there was a way to award ZERO STARS I would do it!!!"
0,"I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. But I stayed about 15 mins before calling it a night.\n\nNot a huge rock fan and if I wanted to watch women shake their moneymakers about, I could have easily gone to my room mirror and jiggle my jello for free.\n\nI need something with guys. Lots and lots of guys. I think I'll go to the Chippendales show at Rio next time."
1,"I wholeheartedly agree with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere. \n\nWhy I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up."
0,"I think you gotta love the \""Stillers\"" or be a Pitt fan to understand why anyone would think this place is terrific.  Sorry guys, I don't necessarily get it.   This is certainly not the most horrible stadium I have ever visited, but it sure isn't up to snuff with many of the other stadiums about the country.  Went to a Univeristy of Pitt football game over the weekend.  Since I am from out of town, I was not familiar with the layout or where to enter in terms of where my seats were located.  Got some pretty bad directions from the staff working outside of the stadium and needless to say, I spent almost the entire first quarter of the game attempting to find our seats.  \n\nI will say that once seated, the view is good and nothing that I could see would impart your vision of the field from wherever you are sitting.  Food offerings are your standard fare (hot dogs, soda, hamburgers, nachos, etc,) - nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nThe main concourse on the street level is pretty nice, and gives you a nice sense of the history of the \""Stillers\"" and is really a walk down memory lane, even for those of us who don't live in Pittsburgh but remember the teams from the 70's and their glory days.  (Yes, admittedly, they are still a pretty terrific team!).\n\nLoved the Heintz bottles on the fan-o-vision that tip over and look like ketsup running down the screen - very cool!"
0,"Nothing Joyful about it. Worst I've had in years. The restaurant is in a failing strip mall. No windows, dark and dingy and it smelled of Pine sol.  Staff did not greet us with a smile ( I can't blame them, maybe too depressed). We went at lunchtime and the place was empty - save for one table.  I ordered the Kung Pao as a safe bet. The chicken was hard and rubbery, the sauce was salty - tasted mostly like soy sauce. I thought maybe it was just me, so I took the rest home for my husband. He said it was \""inedible\"". Then I told him where I went and he said \""I could have told you that, that place is awful\"". \nMy friend ordered the Shrimp in Lobster sauce, she said it was ok, but she would never go back. The egg rolls were soggy and greasy and the fried rice was non nondescript. I have no idea why anyone would give this place 5 stars! I know it's been around a while - maybe they are regulars."
0,"I just resigned my lease earlier this month for another year. I really regret my decision to stay. In the year I have lived here I have had nothing but problems mostly with maintenance but lately with the leasing office. I've had maintenance in my apartment without permission and without living notice they were even there or that they fixed the problem. With the leasing office the lost one of my money orders from June and beginning of October I was made aware of a past due amount on my account. When the leasing office confirmed they did not cash that money order I was told I had to pay to retrieve my money and I was only offered sorry this was a mistake made from previous management. This place could care less about their residents, they have no clue how to run their office and the people who work there are constantly changing therefore no one knows what to do. I would never recommend this as a place to live to anyone."
1,"I struggled between giving this place 4 or 5 stars. I've dined previously in some other Michlen restaurants such as Melisse and Providence in LA and had a different experience at L'atelier. The place looks very simple, nothing unique. More like the back yard of his 3 stars restaurant right next to it. The service was very good. All waitresses were knowledgeable and extremely nice. The food was very good. Some of the dishes were fanominal such us the first dish L'AMUSE BOUCHE, the main dish LA CAILLE and both deserts. Some others were just ok. \nWe've dined with a couple of friends that L'atelier was their first gourmet experience. They enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours dinner we had. They even had a vegeterian alternative for this 9 course dinner that was, according to our vegeterian friend exceptional. \nWe ended up paying about $250 per person after tip.\nKind of pricy but in a place like Las Vegas everything is pricy. \nI'm not sure if I'll go back there but I will defiantly reccomand it to friends.\nI will give 5 stars after all"
1,Excellent sandwiches and just about any other Italian grocery item you can mention!\n\nEasy parking and friendly people too :)
0,"The brewed coffee is okay, depending on the roast. The espresso drinks are disgusting. Their \""house blend\"" used for their espresso drinks is WAYYY too roasted. Honestly, I think they scorch their coffee beans that they use for their espresso drinks. Additionally, they don't rinse the espresso spoons so each drink has burnt espresso residue.  ALSO, their chai is fucking horrible. Worst chai I think I have ever tasted in my life. I basically payed 4.75 for iced milk. Not strong at all. If I want espresso drinks, I usually go to Citizen or Grinders. \n\nTheir food is pretty pricey as well and their portion sizes are pretty small. 10 dollars for an overdressed salad? No thank you. \n\n\nOther than that, if you can over their hipster vibe and the non prescription glasses (which is fucking annoying, did you not graduate from high school???) , the atmosphere is great to crank out homework and it's the only coffee shop that's open late in Central Phoenix. \n\nI'm not old enough to drink at their bar yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty nice and they have a variety of alcohol. \n\nOh and the brown haired girl, I think her name is Sasha, looks pissed off all the time(she is pretty hot though) And the tall white guy, I think his name is Sammy, is pretty bi-polar. Sometimes he is nice; other times he's an asshole."
0,Arg!!! They really need to get more employees or people just need to start using the self service machines for non-complex transactions.  Seriously its not that hard! I dread having to mail anything internationally because then I HAVE to take my package to the counter.  Line is always ridiculously long here.  Doesn't matter what time of the day either.  Honestly if you don't NEED to go to the counter use the self service mailing center or buy an inexpensive scale and print your postage labels from home.  Plus it's discounted online vs at the PO.
1,My sons and i love the place. something about the flavor of the ribs and chicken. been going there for years. look out for groupons & yelp special deals.
1,"Best East Coast pizza this side of the Mississippi! Even though our order is a tad complicated, they always get it right. We appreciate that they have Raspberry Cider and the garlic knots are an excellent excuse for warding off unwanted male suitors."
0,"Very long wait (even though we arrived early and there were few waiting), extremely slow service, food was tasty though."
0,"If you want to bank with a financial institution that have staffs that actually know what they are doing, don't come here!  They may have good intentions and want to protect their customers from fraud, but they also happened to be grossly incompetent or under trained to the point they can't even setup accounts they are recommending.\n\nCame in on three separate occasions to resolve this issue with their 'free' checking and savings account for making small debit and web purchases, but they can't setup the account correctly because the new accounts were never linked to the primary checking/savings accounts.  How I was able to setup monthly recurring transfers with the new accounts, I will never know.  To add insult to injuries, I never even received the card that I was supposed to use for said small purchases, while protecting the primary accounts. The first card probably got lost in the mail, as I moved shortly after and it probably didn't get forwarded to the new address.  The second one, I can't explain.  Maybe I should have made arrangements to physically pick it up from the branch, as they can't stuff envelops and mail it after forcing everyone to go paperless.\n\nAnyway, the staff are pleasant enough but have limited ability to refund monthly fees that were charged, except the immediate 3 months that they can view on their screen.  And after a lot of investigation and tracing the problem to issues linking these new checking and savings account to my primary ones, they said it was ultimately my responsibility for not monitoring my accounts. Never mind that they screwed up in the first place, or the fact that I have no access to it and no reason to monitor it.  Hell, I doubt some thief can fraudulently access the $200 ($162 after WF took their cut) in the account, if I can't even get to it.  And if they can, then hell they deserve it.  Escalated this to their new branch manager,and she also was unable to do anything, after promising to look into it.\n\nWorst customer service ever.  I am so pissed that I am going to close the accounts, take everything out as cash and stuff it under the mattress.  At least the balance will not mysteriously disappeared or result in a -18% return in under a year. If I want to see that kind of return, I can just buy bank stocks."
0,"I like our airport, I think it is pretty nice. \n\nThis is about security which I guess is a part of the airport. \n\nIt is getting tiring. \n\nOld prune faced woman snarking at you, tiring. \n\nSay you have an artificial leg, you get the honor of being pulled aside. OK fine check the leg, but for God sake what is with this wiping the hands down and then the leg. I never see anyone else getting there hands wiped. If you do not find a bomb attached to the leg, leave the hands alone and lets just get on with it. \n\nReally gets tiring for a people who travel a lot."
0,"Pei Wei makes me sad.  Sad because it is literally the ONLY \""Chinese\"" food a downtown resident of the 5th largest city in the country can get for lunch on a lazy hungover Sunday afternoon.\n\n:-("
1,I love this hotel. It has everything! Their suite can accomodate a room full of drunk guys and then some! We never left the hotel...
0,"Eh... The food is eh... I had a chicken breast with a sauce that tasted like the curry dressing from Jolly Bob's. The appetizer was eh. The service was eh. The beer that's available is decent, but not as good as the one they were out of... They can do so much better with the food. It's faux imaginative."
1,The product and service are awesome. We have never had an alarm system before and Lucas took the time to discuss our needs and train us on the equipment. He continually checks in with us to make sure things are working as promised. Did lots of research before going with Proper Guard and it's the best price and service around.
0,"Although I thought it might possibly deserve a 2-star, my two comrades did not agree. The pizza I had was definitely bearable. Not that well cooked but tasty enough. I had the qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois pizza. Cooked well on the bottom, veggies and toppings on top were still room temperature. \n\nOne friend got the pasta al pesto. It was green and tepid. \nOne friend got the penne arabitta. Very spicy, but no taste. Just spice. Might as well have drank a bottle of franks red hot. \nOne friend ordered 2 menu items. This was too hard for the kitchen. They settled on sending is one of them, and pretending like the other was not ordered. \n\nServer had sass. Portions were too small and expensive. Beer was cold though so that's a plus, right? Tourist trap for sure."
0,"Unless you're a hipster, avoid this place.\nThe food was nasty, the facilities were old and dirty (many thanks to the disgusting kids that walk barefoot throughout the building), and the crowd relatively cliquish."
1,"The food is outstanding, as well as the service!"
0,Good place to watch the game but nothing else. Lots of TVs around. The food is whatever's. It is bar food. The garlic fries were super greasy. The chili cheese fries tasted good. And they use cheese whiz. The Philly cheese steak lacked flavor. Burgers/sandwiches are about $16 each and don't even come with fries. It's super expensive here.
1,"So I went to this place when I first moved over to this area and I liked it a lot. Then, for some reason, I thought I would try another shop in the area and, although it was pretty good, it was not awesome and it always seemed more expensive than it should be. \n\nSo I returned to Paulene's today and I certainly won't be changing again! \n\nI got a regular fill and I needed a toe nail fixed as I had an injured toe and half the nail came off while it was healing. I also got a deluxe pedicure that was pure heaven! She spent lots of time on me and they turned out beautifully!\n\nTheir service and the fact that they care about their work and their great pricing makes this an excellent nail salon."
1,"Food was really good!  Pizza was delicious.  Suicide Fries were great, not for the soft pallet for sure. Bar feel with good range of drinks.  Mostly a whiskey bar and not with cocktails."
1,"So excited to be close to a Sprouts again. Their produce is wonderful, and inexpensive. Love the music playing from speakers in the parking lot. I was pleasantly surprised to see how large this store is. Many checkout lanes as well. \nThey were making sushi right in the store, and the quality looked top notch. Had to get some. Yum! Also got some frozen beef tamales, as recommended by another customer. They were amazing! Besides the veggies, I love their bulk spices. I found those over by the baking aisle on an end cap. Along with spices, they also had a few different loose teas. Very affordable. \nCan't wait to come here again next week!"
1,"All things considered, I put this place even with Paradise Bakery as far as a solid lunch place with good sandwiches and salads.  Neither place is perfect but when I add together the positives and negatives of each; they come out even.  In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.\n\nWildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.\n\nWildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.\n\nMy wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.  I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.\n\nI would like to go back soon and try some more sandwiches and salads and maybe some of their breakfast stuffs."
1,"I like the idea of this place more than the actual place.  In theory they could have Apple computers at steep discounts and furniture mad cheap that the university doesn't need anymore that I could possibly give a second life.  Unfortunately the stuff they don't need is normally old dell computers, old mac's and about 1000 file cabinets.  So most the time its crap, but when a dept gets in some cash they update computers and stuff so if you lucky at random times throughout the year you can get an Intel iMac for under 600 dollars which isn't bad at all or you can get a bike that is left in the bike racks on campus for between 50-75 which is actually really good!  If you need a cheap bike in pretty good shape DEF hit this place up otherwise its really hit and miss.  I'm glad it exists I just wish there was more cool stuff ALL THE TIME... that being said I'll drop by this week sometime again either way."
0,"UPDATE: after writing this review I did hear from Sarah the business manager at the Downtown Grand as well as from Choice Hotels corporate - well sort of on the latter.  Choice Hotels corporate sent me a joke of an apology letter that did nothing for me nor did it even address my situation - clearly a form letter which is rather insulting.  After playing phone tag with the Downtown Grand for a while, Sarah gave me the option of rescheduling my stay for another time up to July 2015, which is 1-year after I made the reservation.  Unfortunately that also does nothing for me, because I can't get out to Vegas by then.  \n\nSO...at the end of the day the Downtown Grand is keeping my $400+ bucks, and I'm getting nothing, which leaves my evaluation at 1-star.  Appreciate the effort from Sarah, but it doesn't go far enough.  Was really hoping for a full refund or at least a partial refund, say all but $100.  \n\nFYI - my 4 buddies that I go to Vegas with every year at this time are also incensed about this.  We usually get pizza at the Downtown Grand's pizza restaurant for lunch 1 day during our trip, and they were considering staying at the hotel this time as well.  Well, the restaurant is now off the rotation and they did not reserve their rooms at the Downtown Grand, due entirely to what happened to me.  \n\nHope the Downtown Grand's loss of a couple of thousand dollars of business from us every year was worth the $400+ of mine."
0,"The service was ok, but the food was disappointing. Food was very bland and did not have much flavor. I've been to other Japanese restaurants wayy better than this one."
0,This review isn't directed at this specific store but at CenturyLink as a whole.  This is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with for any type of service.  I have had them for residential and dropped them due to their terrible customer service and horrific internet service.
0,"Went thru the drive through recently and asked for a jr frosty. I had one of those keychain things, but I couldn't find it. After a five minute wait before I got up to the window, I found it. So I told the cashier that I found my key tag for a free jr frosty. So she told me my total. I gave her my cash and looked at my receipt and it was still charge AND she took my frosty card. I said \""the charge is still on the receipt\"" she said that next time, I need to tell her that I have any coupons when I order. I said \"" okay, my bad, I didn't think I had it, but you took my card and didn't tell me I got charged anyway and if that's the case, where's the second frosty then?\"" She goes \""here's your dollar and frosty\"" and then closed the window. It's not the money, it's about the fact that I was treated soooo rudely!!! Never going back there!"
0,"rooms good\nbuffet sucks even at 2 for 1 price. \nGilles food sucks. no stars. \ncoffee shop very good. \npool is okay.\n$ 28.00 resort fee daily , every day. you pay. when you check out."
1,"I had a green curry and tofu pad prik, both were quite good. The Green curry was spicy without being overpowering, or more specifically it was that good cooked in spice rather than just adding more paste. This is a good place."
0,"CLOSED, but I posted a pic of a funny sign posted on their door."
1,decent education at a decent price!
1,"I'll admit it. I'm a Best Western fanboy. \n\nWhen out of town, my girlfriend and I have always opted for the pricier hotels, to guarantee a nice clean place and a good experience, but lately we've found ourselves going more and more with Best Western. Their prices are always very cheap, the rooms spotless, the service impeccable, and with complimentary breakfast to boot. Their Waterloo location is no exception.\n\nTheir free wifi gave us no issues, and the room was relaxing, with a terrific bed. The parking lot is strangely designed, but once you exit the first time, it makes sense in a maniacal sort of way. The hotel was also smack in the middle of where we needed to go, so it was perfect.\n\nGood job as always, Best Western."
0,"Definitely one of my worst Vegas hotel experiences:\n\n1. The hotel room doors have nothing to stop them from slamming shut. This is not only a danger to children with heavy doors slamming shut, but guess what you will get to hear all night? Drunk people coming home and slamming their room doors. Midnight...1am...2am...3am...\n\n2. The hotel is connect to the MGM grand and the strip...via a more than a half mile corridor one-way. There are moving sidewalks, but they functioned about 25% of the time during our stay.\n\n3. Only half the wall electrical outlets in the room worked. Some had metal pieces sticking out of the wall.\n\n4. Their \""low-flow\"" toilet took 20 minutes to fill...that's 20 minutes between flushes. Hope your group isn't in a rush to use the bathroom when you get back to the room..."
1,"I love this location, especially when (the woman with tons of curly brown natural hair) is working/in charge--not sure if she's a manager but she should be. Somehow things are always rocking when she is there, and the baristas are knocking them out just right. But it's almost always perfect there. My priority is my drink--clean shots and creamy soy. It's also good for studying and work--not too loud.\n\nSecond, it usually has a 101 sanitation rating so I can get a latte in winter without worrying about picking up a cold too.\n\nThat said, this place MUST solve its fly problem in warm weather. Flies come from somewhere and Corporate should be finding out where and dealing with it.\n\nAlso, ALL Starbucks should ban smoking on the premises. The smoke flows in the door and suffocates everyone inside. Because this location is small and a dead-end inside, the smoke is worse. East Blvd is the worst, though. And cigar smoking is just plain rude.\n\nStarbucks Corporate also needs to prevent people from going between cash register and drinks making without hand washing. This is the law but no Starbucks observes it that I've seen. This is rare at this location though--another reason I like it.\n\nI'm kinda confused why someone found the place too \""White House\"" for them. Is that a new code word? No Starbucks employee ever talks politics on the job. This guy is probably upset that Starbucks employees get benefits for part-time. I like the fact that they are more likely to be going to the doctor and staying home when they are sick, not giving me their bug. Another reason I avoid the independents."
0,"The place looked interesting thought Id give it a try, bad idea.  Service is average - Food NOT good.  Burger was dry flavor bland and on horrible bread.  Even didnt like the fries really??? The price of the burgers a bit high.  Best burger Ive had in town is the GRIND costs $12, bad burgers should be $7-8."
1,"This is the perfect atmosphere  to get in shape. Great studio, friendly instructors and the owners are very welcoming. Wide variety of classes so you won't get bored . I would definitely recommend."
1,"It's always fun to try a new spot and when you can have unlimited bowls for Stir Fry for 9.95, it's even more fun!\n\nWe were also happy to be welcomed here because at the brewery down the street there was a 20 to 25 minute wait when half the tables were empty.  I never quite get that concept but hey, nice to walk on down  the street to where you are welcome.\n\nIf you check in on Yelp, you get a free app of steamed Endamame which while we didn't really like them, was still a nice gesture.  My first bowl had a brown motif - beef, brown rice, teriyaki sauce and bunches of veggies.  I liked it a lot but you know those baby corn that were so hilarious in the movie Big?  Really I didn't need more than two!  I decided to not finish that bowl so I could have a yellow themed masterpiece - chicken, pineapple, pork, orange ginger sauce plus pineapple sweet sour sauces with lots of onions/green peppers.  Also a masterpiece but I couldn't finish it all.  If I lived close, I would have done the deal where you get to bring home a bowl for like 4 bucks.\n\nNice server, good bathrooms and a wonderful time visiting with my daughter and son in law after yet another crushing Illini defeat.  Eating here couldn't make up for that boo boo but it sure is a nice alternative to the snotty attitude at Destihled.  \n\nNice job, 301 Mongolia but tell me the truth, do people really eat that steamed endamame?"
0,This deserves a zero star. Went for dinner as I got a groupon. \n\nThe food was old and cold. Hardly any variety and it should not be called a buffet. It was looking like lunch left overs. Most of the servers  were old men and women( no offense ) meant. The service was very slow and indecent I would say.\n\nThe guy comes with the lemonade and bangs it on the table. When a big group came in he arrange the nearby table which is fine. But he asked and moved our table to the otherwise while we were still eating. Ridiculous!!! They seriously need some sense and training.\n\nFood 0\nService 1\nAmbience 2\nCleanliness 2\n\nWill never go back .
0,"They will mess up your reservation. I made two room reservations three months ago for a family vacation.  When I made the reservations I made one request:  I need the rooms on the same floor next to each other.  They said they will do it.  However when I checked in today, I found that they totally ignored my request.  I checked in as possible but they said they don't have rooms anymore.  They put us on different floor.  Now my wife and kids are going to be on different floor. What kind of idiots ignores one effing request.  Now my family needs to split up and stay on different floors. Way to f up someone's vacation. You f morons."
1,"Dr. Parikh is simply the best. Without going into too much personal detail, he was our light at the end of a very dark tunnel. He and his staff were always so patient, positive, and accommodating. A situation that at one point seemed incredibly grim and confusing was broken down into individual steps by this skilled doctor and his staff that led to a much more positive road. The wait times are minimal when you have an appointment, and the doctor will never make you feel rushed or leave without answering all of your questions. He truly cares about each of his patients, and that is a rarity in this city. Switching to Dr. Parikh was probably one of the best decisions we've made.  I have referred a friend to see him when he also was faced with a tough situation. He cannot thank me enough for referring him to a Dr. who for once not only knew what he was talking about, but was patient and compassionate enough to help get his patients through a very difficult and confusing time in their life."
0,"Right when i walked in The carpet smelled like old rag and it makes you want to throw up also the dance floor is super small \n\nMy friend ,not drunk at all, wanted to play with the water near the pool and the security showed us where the restroom was...lied and brought us to the exit saying she can't be in their club because she was too drunk which I have to emphasize that she was NOT which made the guys who came with waste their $30-40\n\nThe alcohol was not strong at all.., once the ice melted it felt like I was drinking cranberry juice or watered down soda \n\nBut anyways they had open bar for girls so I guess it made it up even though guys had to pay for weak alcohol\n\nThe go go dancer or pole dancer was great though she went all the way up towards the ceiling hanging upside down with her legs probably the best thing that happened that night +1 star for the dancer :)"
1,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! Who'd ever thought sandwiches could be THAT good? I've had a couple different kinds here and they're all so goooooood. I had the original, tuna melt, chipotle chicken avocado and the Caribbean jerk. I would have to say my favorite is the tuna melt and the chipotle chicken avocado. The original is really good too with the horseradish. And the caribbean jerk has this sweet explosion of peppers. They're all so good! I definitely want to come back and get some more but I live too far... Next time during my trip back to Vegas, I will definitely try some other sandwiches. I did find there's a location in Anaheim. Maybe I'll have to make the trip down there."
0,"My garage door opener died a few weeks ago. This company came out and replaced a part. Was working for 4 days. Then died again. They came out a second time and fixed it again. It broke down 3 days later, same issue. Called for a 3rd time and was told a tech was coming. They didn't show. Mix up in the office apparently. Rude receptionist didn't want to make things right and said a tech may come in 3 days. Techs were nice. Who knows whats up with my garage door opener. But geez...horrible customer service. Note: my home warranty company chose this company. I did not. Having someone else come tomorrow."
1,"Im ehemaligen Ettlinger Kino hat sich die Hausbrauerei Vogel niedergelassen. War schon lange nicht dort, kann mich aber noch sehr gut an den Sonntags-Brunch mit (lauter) Jazz-Musik erinnern. Falls es das noch gibt -- Hingehen. Das leckere Vogelbr\u00e4u-Bier gibt's ausser in Ettlingen auch noch im Vogel Karlsruhe.\n\n\n Edit 2008: Auch w\u00e4hrend der Mittagszeit ist der Vogel voll. Dennoch bekommt man sein Essen recht z\u00fcgig."
0,This is the worst example of food I have ever seen.  This place was so dirty it should be closed by the board oh health. Don't expect anything but the worst  service ever.
1,"My friends and I went to this restaurant for the first time and found it to be very good.  One of us had pizza, 2 that had whole wheat linguine pasta with marinara sauce and 1 had broccoli cheese soup and a half turkey sandwich.  All was very good tasting, and hot when delivered.  The service was very good, friendly wait staff.  We would recommend this place for casual dining and we will return! Lunch prices were very reasonable."
0,"My husband had been here before & loved the apple pie ala mode.  It had been served hot with the ice cream lusciously  melting onto it. This time our experience was quite different. We had ordered black & bleu burgers with onion rings. The onion rings were quite good, burger was fine. The bun was mediocre & it was served with packets of mayo. Didn't see that coming. The thing is the service was so slow. It took forever to just get the burgers. Then it took our server 20 minutes to clear & get our pie order. I get it takes awhile to cook the pie but we heard the pie was at the pass 10 minutes before it was served to us, cold. We didn't even eat it but got the bill & left. The service was inexcusable. We are done with Bill Johnson & his big apples."
0,"Besides bad food at Planet Dailies, I enjoyed my stay at PH last time. That was why I suggested my family to stay there this time. However, it was a disappointment. Was it because of spring break and the crowd? The bath tub in our room was not clean. My sister saw floating grey particles before she entered the tub. Yeah, that was gross. I asked house keeping to clean the tub but apparently the person who answered the phone did not understand the word \""tub\"". I repeated 5 time \""Please send someone to clean the bath tub\"" and all I got was \""what?\"" REALLY?"
1,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  I love the chicken corn tortilla tacos...along with a big cup of iced tea!  I always get in and out of this location! Good job!
0,"From a gluten free perspective, they really could do better, especially since they are a mexican restaurant, it should be easier to have gluten free options.  They do have a gluten free menu but there are only about 5 or 6  things on it.  One was a machaca bowl and one a chicken bowl.  I asked if there is rice in the bowl and the waitress said no, the rice contains wheat.  So, I'm not sure what was in the bowl other than meat.  The other things on the GF menu included veggie fajitas or shrimp fajitas minus the corn tortilla (the waitress told me the corn tortillas have wheat but they were on the GF menu).  I ordered the ultimate nachos (which weren't even on the GF menu) and they were good.  I excluded a couple of items that might have gluten.  I did not get sick.  The waitress did not speak very good english, so it was a risk eating anything there."
0,"Was asked to review this for fiancee.   She went there with friends for drinks on a this evening (Sunday) and waited about 20 minutes to be served at bar (bar was not busy) before finally giving up.  Was walking out of place and made a mention of this to the doorman who said thanks, have a nice day, and f*** off.  Nice manners"
0,"Papa Chevo's was a quick stop from an outing night for me.  Though I was still coherent so no excuses on my part.\n\nPlace was dead, but being the night was still young I'm sure this place can get overwhelmed.  I ordered the beef Sopes with rice and beans.  Overall, nothing to special in my Mexican food repertoire.  I thought it was pretty simplistic and what I would expect; Fried corn tortilla, topped with refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  \n\nIn the end, I thought it was nothing out of the box, but something I can ingest if I was really hungry. - Enjoy!"
1,"Nice, clean, and pretty. I like that it's away from everything and especially the madness of the Las Vegas Strip. The movie theater (Regal Cinemas) is nice and I like the addition of the fan-favorite Yard House restaurant. This is my choice of visit when deciding on a casual night of a movie or outing. The property is overall really nice and as long as they keep offering great establishments within, it's definitely worth a visit."
1,"The first thing you need to know, Insert Coins is genius. Ask yourself, \""how do I get people to come to my bar and stay there?\"" this place nails it with its Outside-of-the-Vegas-Box atmosphere. This place draws EVERYONE in whether you're a mega video game nerd or the hippest hipster on Fremont who just left The Griffin across the street. A sausage fest? Debatable. Awesome, one hell of a good time and a place any chick can appreciate and love? FACT. Anyone hoping to open their own bar can take a few notes from the people who opened this joint.\n\nInsert Coins is filled with what looks like local art you can actually purchase, contemporary/modern bright wonderful furniture, old school arcade games and a fabulous bar where you can sit and play video games for FREE while you drink. The staff is amazing too. Super friendly and personable without being cheesy and over the top. This is an extremely popular spot so be prepared to rub shoulders with some close friends and strangers. \n\nWhoever did the interior design for this place needs to come visit me in UT. I LOVED the retro furniture and especially loved the large sea foam green/turquoise toned couch. The two negative things I can say about this place? 1- The music. It is absolutely horrible. Not bad enough to keep me away. And 2- Whoever designed the space could have moved things around a little more. The bar area is amazing. Nice long horizontal bar in the middle of the room with big tv's on the wall above you for you to enjoy a little gaming while you drink and an awesome counter that lights up under you. The rest of the room is crammed in some areas and completely open and blank in others. The art is cluttered on the walls around all the arcade games that are also cluttered around each other. Have fun trying to play while people bump into you and have fun trying to walk through looking at art with everyone hanging and playing games. The back of the bar where the DJ is is completely wide open and kind of an eye sore. They made a poor attempt at filling the space by putting two large wrap around couches for people to sit at. It doesn't exactly flow. The other side of the room has huge amazing couches where you can sit and play games but... the tv's don't even face the chairs. Kind of confusing.\n\nThis place is rad and easily my second favorite bar to date right behind The Griffin my hipster haven across the street. Two of my favorite bars are located in a stat I don't even live in. Check it out the next time you make a Vegas trip!"
1,"Clean hotel, fast service, very friendly staff. Friends and I stayed here for EDC. It is very close to the Speedway and there is a complimentary breakfast in the morning. :) Compared to all the other hotels I saw in the area, it looked like a 5 star hotel. Also, it isn't pricey and the room I stayed in had a microwave, fridge, and a flat screen tv."
1,"Wendys hasn't been Wendys for years now. It is owned by Arbys. But either way this is a very good \""Wendys\"". If anyone noticed, the food turned to crap awhile ago. If you are craving Wendys, this one is pretty much the cleanest in the area. The workers actually seem to care! This is my favorite Wendys."
1,"This place simultaneously makes me happy and freaks me out.  It's great to be able to find tons of (mostly Asian, but also some other ethnic) food items not available at most grocers.  This time, I enjoyed some new rice types (they have at least 10-20 varieties), interesting noodles (purple wheat?), Japanese rice seasoning and jamaican jerk marinade.  So far all have been a hit.\n\nThe freaky parts are the random fish heads floating in a bucket in the refrigerated section.  And other indecipherable items.  Yikes.  Prepare for some strong smells and potentially scary sights.  But really great prices on lots of ethnic cooking ingredients - totally worth it."
0,Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money.
1,"For all the people who sit down and don't get any \""service,\"" there are signs that clearly say to order at the bar. So I would start with that. Then do this in any order you'd like:\n-cold beer\n-wings\n-cheesecurds\n\nYour welcome."
0,"I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours, we ordered a blt with chili and a cesar salad....1 hour latler a stale BLT and chili that looked like it had been sitting there for 2 hours comes out. I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch."
1,"I came here for my birthday and it just so happens to be a Mexican holiday so I guess the buffet price was a bit more than usual. I came at 2:30pm on a Saturday and paid $55. I had to wait in line for about an hour. \n\nWhen I finally got seated, my friends and I didn't know where to start! There was soo many selections and everything looked delicious! I went for the king crabs and oysters! They tasted so fresh and easy to eat.\nI ate my money worth here and my favorite part was the dessert section! They had macarons and ice cream, and you can even make your own crepe! I was so full from eating all the food but always have room for dessert. \nThis place did not disappoint. I would defiantly come here again and try some other foods that I didn't get to try."
1,"Absolutely love it! Great atmosphere, great people, great food and drink specials, great location. You'll see me here over and over again. For sure"
0,"I am giving one star for Zach the waiter and one star for Heather the Manager..... I eat gluten free due to my health issues.  I went here specifically because they cater to the GF crowd.  That being said after the time I had I am rather worried because if they are as GF cautious as they are about HOW they cook: Meh, not so confident!!!\n\nI started out with a side salad with their house Creamy Parmesan dressing.  The dressing was quite tasty but the salad was less than fresh.  It was plentiful with carrots, thinly sliced celery and some other items but the romaine lettuce was extremely brown and had that taste which told me:  I AM NOT FRESH!  Honestly, it was so brown I just told him to take it away.\n\nHe suggested I try soup instead so I had him bring me some lentil soup which was really very good.  It made up for the salad.  My Iced Tea was good as well.   The hubs got a Magharita Pizza which he said was very good.  The basil and tomato were very fresh and good but there was not much mozz on it at all.  The dough was perfectly done.\n\nThis restaurant prides itself on being a \""from scratch kitchen\"" and they encourage changes to menu items if needed.  That being the case, I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which is grilled chicken breast stuffed with Fontina and Prosciutto, with mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce.  I didn't want the lemon butter sauce so they were going to replace it with the Marsala wine sauce...this was Zach's suggestion, by the way!\n\nUpon getting my entree, which was two very small breasts, it was in the butter lemon and not marsala sauce.  I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.  If you've had either of these versions the one thing you would note is:  They taste horrible together!  It sucked.\n\nSo I told Zach that they had just given me back the original breast with new sauce and he said:  Well, it would take too long to remake the whole thing so he just put it back on the grill to grill off the lemon sauce and then replaced it with the Marsala.  WHAT???  Really??\n\nUm, I just said FINE. and told the hubs we will NEVER be back.  The next thing I know, Heather, a manager is stopping by the table.  She says, \""I hear things aren't going well today....\"" and I then told her our story.  She then states that not only has she taken my entree off the bill but she is making me the corrected version to go and giving us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try.\n\nWell, I am impressed a bit by this.  Taking it off the bill was nice but adding the additional two \""gives\"" made it almost okay.  It's too bad they just couldn't have made it a five star experience the first time....but given that they were so generous, I'll at least give them the chance to do it right.\n\nTo be continued.............."
1,Little hole in the wall buffet. Very inexpensive for great food. The pollos magnifico was awesome and the owner offered me a taco which he brought right to me.  The only drawback was no beer but I was there midday during the week do I wouldn't have wanted one anyway. I think they have a drivethrough as well
1,"Centered between my school, office and house, Copper Star Coffee offers a cozy and versatile environment perfect for doing homework, meeting up with a friend, or simply staring out the window and contemplating life.\nThe variety of hot teas they offer is rather good, as is their hot drip coffee. If you ever get the chance to try their peach blackberry muffin, please do so. It's unlike any muffin I've ever had before.\nThe only downside is parking. They have a parking lot with two spaces plus one handicap space. If you're driving, you're most likely going to have to park on the street or in the neighboring boutique's parking lot (and I don't think they like it when you do that.)"
0,I was so excited about their anniversary 50% off deal but I didn't realize they'd only do a 50 % job. They did a horrible job! They left watermarks all over my car. And my seats weren't even cleaned nor dry BUT they sure did remembered to clean out my middle console and STOLE all my change about 5 bucks worth. Im NEVER going back there again!
0,"Make sure you ask for extra toppings in your blizzard. If not, the bottom 1/3 will only be ice cream. Even after asking for extra candy the chances are it will still be very light compared to other dairy queens. Unfortunately this is the only DQ close to me otherwise I would definitely choose a different location."
1,"This place was such a surprise! Delicious food that ended up being pretty healthy with lots of gluten free options! I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were honestly the strips of crispy corn tortillas made it little hard to eat with a fork. I can't complain too much, they were delicious! Whether or not you have dietary restrictions, this place is fantastic. Check them out!"
0,"I remember when the RIO used to ROCK harder than any other hotel casino in town, but this way waaayyyy back in the late 90's.  It's sad to see what was such a grand dame age so poorly.\n\nRooms are large but completely outdated without flatscreens.  Carpet, drapes and bathrooms are in desperate need of updating, and I saw many worn out and taped spots on casino floor.  Harrah's bought and paid a fortune for this property and are obviously trying to milk every single cent out of it.  It's sad, and only stayed here on NYE because I waited too long to book at the places I normally stay at like ARIA and the Wynn.  Restaurants weren't great back in the 90's and still aren't very good, although the burger I had at the American Grill was really tasty.  No good looking people stay here and the cheese factor has definitely been turned up with bikini clad chicks singing karaoke on top of the slot machines.\n\nDefinitely wouldn't be coming back here!"
1,Went for breakfast early one morning. Sat at the bar and had excellent service and who doesn't love an omelette with bacon and brie? The breakfast was amazing and I'm already looking forward to my next meal there.
1,"The prices on the menu outside almost scared me off, but they were just dinner specials. I ended up getting the canons burg burger, being a fan of buffalo sauce and bleu cheese. It was the best bleu cheese burger I've had in my life. And the fries- they give you so many fries, you have to dig out your burger from under them. All for a price of about $11. I was very impressed, will recommend to friends, and plan to come back."
1,"The summer is the best time for skating because most people do not associate this season with ice skating.  Hence, the public sessions on the weekends are less crowded compared to the winter season's even with the kids out for summer vacay.  As for a great way to cool off, this ice rink is the best in Vegas especially during the hot summers.  Plus, parents have an option to play in the casino while the kids are able to skate.   If you are hungry between ice cuts or after skating, the Subway is usually the most popular.  The Panda Express is the second most popular for food.  As for parking, the parking garage is a bit more cooler than by the ice rink.  However, the parking next to the ice rink is closer to the arena without walking through the casino.  Furthermore, the staff is friendly and hospitable!  In conclusion, I highly recommend SoBe ice rink inside the Fiesta Rancho Casino and Hotel!  :)"
0,Ordered pizza at at 11 am for 12:45pm delivery. Took till 2:20pm to deliver. It's a shame such good pizza is delivered by incompetence.
1,"The vibe is super cool. Although trendy and somewhat posh, there's a cozy feel about the restaurant. I've enjoyed patio dining on a few occasions now and it's super cute. The patio is along the canal which gives a relaxed feel to things. Although a bit pricey, you are paying for the location and experience and I'd say it was definitely worth it."
0,Yeah no... Fries are dried up. They are the frozen crinkled kind. Texas toast was buttery that's fine... The chicken I have to admit was lightly breaded... But dry and seems like its been sitting for a day. So wanted to try it. I did. And I will now continue to pass it on my way.
1,"If you're looking for a classic, no frills, sushi bar experience, this is the place for you.  Sit at the sushi bar and chum it up with your chef.  Great food, great prices!  If Kyoto is closed, go here!  It's just a couple blocks south!  You won't regret it.  Don't let the negative reviews fool you... Some people go to a restaurant to be seen socially.  Some want to eat good food! If you are the former, go to roka akor.  If you're the latter, give stingray sushi a go!"
1,"I loooove this place!\n\nBeen here twice and both GREAT experiences...\n\nFirst had brunch here a couple weeks ago, and we were a happy bunch to say the least... they had an all you can drink champagne brunch for $18.00 i think... i honestly can't remember right now (=P) but it was pretty cheap and the food we got was insanely HUGE! They started us out first with freshly made mini donettes.. and lemme just say how much i LOOOOOVEEEE mini donettes, mini donuts people not donut holes. =)  AND THE MEAL:  i had a steak salad.. and it looked more like an open faced steak sandwich. . . believe me, it was delicious none the less.  \n\nof course i sampled everyone else's food ... chopped salad = my fav, french toast with fruit = YAY, and there was one more dish and it was delicious but.... the mimosas' have permanently erased it from my mind for some reason.  \n\n2nd time around, was over this past weekend for dinner with my bf and my cousins... and being the boys that they are... i was worried about them getting enough food in their tummies and was seriously considering a nasty buffet over this. good thing i didn't pick the buffet.  Our meal started with a pitcher of strawberry margarita (Y-U-M-M-MY), the philly cheesesteak dumplings and pulled pork eggrolls - small in size but it was an appetizer so was perfect to begin the meal off with.  Entree's: Filet Mignon, Linguine & clams, BBq Brisket with cheesy grits,  Grilled Salmon & Citrus salad, Tuna Au Poivre, and Shrimp with an Eggplant pasta situation ( can't remember).  Everything we had at the table with very delicious, well seasoned, perfectly cooked.  \n\nThe service was absolutely great both times... never had an empty water glass or champagne flute =) Our waiters constantly checked up on us to see if we needed anything else which earned them big tips =). The music was great and we had a beautiful view of the strip from our booth... so definitely get a booth if you find urself here.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place, and has made a true fan out of me. =)  I will be back to enjoy you again. =)"
0,"Been waiting for this place to open for a few months with anticipation & I guess that got the best of me bc it ended up being a big disappointment. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch on a weekday a couple weeks after they opened. The menu was small & I had a really hard time time deciding on what to order, mainly bc nothing really sounded all that enticing. I was also somewhat surprised that they didn't have any lunch specials to offer. The waitress said that was their regular menu that they have all the time. Really? You don't even get fries with your sandwiches. Yep, a la carte baby! & trust me, these are not a la carte worthy fries. I finally settled on the \""Flyin Hawaiian\"" chicken sandwich. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked that morning & then reheated right before they brought it it to me, not to mention that all the different flavors just really didn't work well together. The fries are not really even worth mentioning. Definitely not fresh & the dipping sauces were bland & didn't even get served until we were almost done eating. \n\nMy husband got the cajun meat sticks which were overcooked & tough. It was just 3 sticks served on a bed of crispy fried hashbrowns? It was probably one of the most boring dishes I've ever seen or had the displeasure of tasting. \n\nService was painfully slow & there were only about 2 or 3 other tables being waited on. Right before leaving, I made the mistake of asking why the restaurant was only going to be serving to patrons 18 & over. I didn't realize that when we first sat down & noticed a sign as we were getting ready to leave so I was curious. The waitress launched into a nasty anti-kid rant. Chill lady, it was a question. I'm not a psychiatrist that can help you with your feelings about why you don't like kids. I can understand bars that don't allow people under 21 in, but to have a place smack dab in suburban Henderson with a very fun feel to it with classic video games & the ability to separate the bar area, (can we say completely different building?!) I don't understand why you wouldn't want to expand your client base! Our family would probably be eating there (if the food ever got better) min 1-2 times a month with my 3 growing boys.. They love the classic video games. Seems like a missed market to me. I have to say, I left with a pretty bad taste in my mouth & not just from the food :/"
1,"Been to both the Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers in Goodyear and on Bell Road.  WE ARE HUGE FANS!  \n\nWe are always greeted quickly and in a friendly way.  The staff is very helpful and attentive!  \n\nThe food is amazing, great value for the money.  As one reviewer pointed out the burgers are thin...but we order a double and let me tell you \""it'll make your tongue slap your eyeballs out!\""  The burgers are VERY filling, so don't let that fool you.  \n\nThe fries are shoestring style and super crispy, their Freddy's dipping sauce and the seasoning is outstanding...we even bought some there and use at home to season our own BBQ and fries/hashbrowns.  \n\nThe Frozen custard is delicious and creamy.  Great portions and worth the money....our family of 6 (myself, husband, 3 teenagers and a 9 year old) ate for $38 which is just about what we pay when we (used to) go to McDonalds or Sonic (we don't \""do\"" them anymore...burnout!)  Why go there when we can hit FREDDY's!\n\nWe go out of our way to visit them.  Never been disappointed (knock on wood) ;)\n\nOnly bummer...kinda far for us.....which now that I mention it could be a good thing, don't wanna turn into a SuperSize version of ME   (yep, it's THAT GOOD) ;)"
1,I love pizza. More than I should admit. Moving from a small town to Pittsburgh widened my options. I've made it a goal to try as many different pies this city has to offer. No need to read further. Just go. Now. \n\nAiello's is my go to everytime. I crave it. Nothing has yet to compare. Start with a crispy but not to crusty underbelly and a mild chewy but not to soft center. Baked to perfection. The sauce it the epitome of Italian spice profiles. Not sweet from added sugar like you so often find but a natural hint of the sweetness from the tomatoes. The cheese. Oh the cheese! \n\nGo to Aiello's. Right now. The price is worth every mouthwatering bite. Why are you still reading this? Go.
1,"Carnegie Delicatessen\n\nhttp://www.mirage.com/restaurants/carnegie-delicatessen.aspx\n\nWe stopped by The Carnegie Deli located in the Mirage Casino complex for a quick lunch bite before heading out for the afternoon.  There is nothing small about the sandwiches in this place.  The seating is tight, so we were able to get a good view of the many items being served.  The two of us split a pastrami sandwich ($3 to split a sandwich) with enough left over to take back to our daughter for lunch as well.  It was the smaller of two sizes priced at $16 and was huge.  They guy 2 tables over from us ordered the larger size for $20 with 2  1/2 pounds of meat.  He barely ate half.  We ordered fries with the sandwich for $3.99 and they came on a platter with enough fries for 5 people.  We saw others that ordered the hot dogs which had to be about a foot long.  The guy on the other side of us ordered a turkey sandwich that was at least 7 inches high.  They put New York style dill pickles on the table for a pre-meal snack.  You will not leave this place hungry.  Our check was around $27, we would definitely eat here again."
0,"What a waste of 40 minutes. . My husband asked where our order was and they said it was coming out next. 15 minutes later, still no food. Gave our order to some other table.\nAsked for our money back then left. Can't say if the food was good since we never got to try any. Will NOT be going back - even for take out. This is my first negative comment about a restaurant on yelp. I always like to write about great service and food only but I'm fairly pissed that no one there really cared. Need more employees to handle the crowds."
1,"Went back to see if the first time was a fluke and to see if the other reviews were right, but again we had AWESOME service! We had Joe this time and he was just as attentive as Cody was. Cody even recognized us and said hi! The waiters here are very fun and quick to serve us. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews because both experiences we have had here were great on all levels! Food service and ambience were all great!!!"
0,"This review is being written after contacting Ultra Star via email and not receiving any response to our complaint.  That was 3 weeks ago.\n\nI can't complain about the movie portion of Ultra Star, that's not the problem... the problem is with their concessions.  We were there on a Monday for a 1pm showing and it wasn't busy at all.  There were three customers in front of us and one person working the counter.  We were patient for awhile but after over 15 minutes we were starting to get a little frustrated.  What added to the frustration was the fact that there were 4 employees (3 of which looked like managers) in a circle chatting it up and laughing.  My husband even took a picture on his cell phone of the employees, which I attached to my original email.  What we couldn't quite wrap our heads around was why wouldn't one of those employees jump behind the counter to at least ring up the orders?  It seems pretty simple, right?\n\nBottom line is it took us 20 minutes to pay $20 for popcorn and soda.  What a deal!"
0,Today I only tried the Thai iced tea and fried ice cream I had to cure my sweet tooth. \n\nThe Thai iced tea was good and Im still sipping on it now BUT the fried ice cream was a disaster! It was a thick ball of fried crust I opened it up an out poured nothing but melted ice cream WHAT A BUMMER yuck I will never ever order that again.
1,I recently had a great experience at Austin Village Eyecare.  The staff was great and I was able to set up an appointment in no time.  Dr. Bhat was thorough and took extra time to explain and discuss all of my options.  Extremely convenient and the office is very clean and modern.  Thanks Dr. Bhat!
1,Just visited La Bona Pasta for the first time and really enjoyed it.  We live nearby and have been driving by without trying it for a long time.  We decided we wanted something different for dinner and found a coupon so we figured what the heck.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a strip mall and the dining room is very small.  The kitchen is open so you can watch them prepping and cooking while you wait.  This makes the atmosphere very cozy and I think adds to the experience.\n\nThe staff was very attentive and friendly and the food was fresh and tasted home made.  Definitely no microwaves here.\n\nWe're happy that we finally gave La Bona Pasta a try and will definitely be back again soon.
0,"I spent most of my first year being legal drinking age at this wild, college bar. It was fun then, but I got older, it wore on me. It's a big ASU bar and there's no escaping the drunk college kids. The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights.\n\nWith the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you don't want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings."
1,This place is the ultimate diet killer!  All I can say is that the food here is different and it's awesome.  You simply have to experience it for yourself.  I've only eaten here twice because I am limiting myself to once a month.  I actually schedule eating at this place in my phone.  It's that good!
0,"This was my first time here. I typically love Mexican, but I was disappointed. The food was mediocre, but at least it was filling. Next time, I'm sticking to the always reliable Chipotle. Cheaper and tastier.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, but the vibe I got from other customers was cold and unwelcoming. I'm sure others may have a better experience here, but it's not for me."
0,"After just moving here, I've been searching for \""my breakfast place\"", one that is locally owned and has personality.  I so wanted JP's to be that place, but only found ultra-average eats instead.  I had an omelet, whole wheat toast and home fried potatoes.  The potatoes were terrific!  The omelette was supposed to be oven baked, which makes them rise and usually makes them super tasty with a little crunch to the edges.  No such thing here; I simply can't believe mine saw anything but the omelette pan.  It didn't even look like it contained the advertised 3 eggs.  Maybe 3 quail eggs!!  Very, very average.  Toast was toast, and it was even delivered late.  I had hoped for better!"
1,"I LOVE The Loft. I've been going to my hair dresser, Kristine Forner, for the past 4 years and she ended up here a couple years ago. Everyone is friendly and they offer my favorite hair products. Bumble and Bumble! I would definitely recommend coming here to get your hair did. I also had Dawna Buckroff do my hair in a pin up style and she did an awesome job.  Two thumbs up!"
0,Not impressed... Connecting in PHX . They did not have shrimp and ran out of guacamole... What Mexican without Guacamole?
0,"I went here a couple of weeks ago, it is brand new and clean. We love the one in town square so i was happy one was opening by my house. Dinner was pretty good for them just opening a week before but i still feel the prices do not match what you get. The worse part was the food poisoning or bug that me & the bf had TWO weeks after this meal. I though the fish tasted extremely fishy and should have sent it back.. But overall, good service & nice location. Never eating here again tho."
0,"Forget about fear of clowns, if that's your issue.  I was more scared of the fact that my room was the scene of an obvious Crack party prior to my check in.  Upon entry none of the lamps would turn on,  so I reached for the lightbulbs.  Simply put, they were greasy with fingerprints.  The remote control was sticky.  The TV and wireless modem had been unplugged behind the TV cabinet and brownish toilet paper had been stuffed in the peephole.  No doubt some very important crackhead was trying to keep \""the man\"" from surveilling their going's on in the room while they binged.\n\nOn to the exercise room.  After signing out a key for the workout area I had to be escorted there by security as it is impossible to find in that aging labyrinth.  Neither my key card nor the security guards worked so I had to knock to be let in.  I wish that I hadn't.  The smell of old, penetrating and sour sweat hit me like a sledge hammer.  Like if I kept my heavily used workout shorts moist and warm in a plastic bag for several years.  Not good.  It took more work to find an operational machine than anything I did in that terrible room.\n\nSecond night in the hotel I returned at 11pm, tired and ready to sleep in my crack sheets, when alas, my card key didn't open the door to my room.  I called the front desk and they sent security up.  The first security person's card didn't work so they had to call up another guard.  I told the first that, \""this is Vegas, and if I were a betting person I would wager that the fact that my card worked earlier but doesn't now, and that your master card doesn't work, the door lock is broken.\""  My logic was apparently not sound enough because they called up another, whose card didn't work either.  They had to call up maintenance with some secret room opening device that I couldn't see.  I then had to relocate to a new room at 1am.  They were gracious enough to offer me late check-out for the inconvenience.\n\nFinally, the food at the buffet.  I was really hungry.  However, my hunger was clearly not powerful enough to make a single item on the nasty buffet palatable.  I even tried simple things like the chicken strips just trying to get some sustenance, but even they were inedible.\n\nIf you are someone who has young children that you don't mind dragging around at midnight while you while away their college tuition, then this is the place for you, as it was for countless others of this description.\n\nThat ain't me though, and I won't be going back to the place that made me think even less of Vegas..."
1,"I picked up a half dozen cupcakes at Mind over Batter to share with some friends. The cupcakes were moist and delicious. I had not been in before and randomly selected six that looked great. The store is super cute and the staff is very friendly. The cupcakes run around $4 a piece, a half dozen set me back $21.25."
1,"Let's just start by saying - This place ROCKS!\n\nAs I have done in the past I use Yelp, and the Open Table Reservations to make the weekends more enjoyable by placing reservations online more than a week in advance. \n\nOur reservations were for 7:15pm and we were promptly seated at 7:15pm.  Our servers name was Ann Marie and she was fantastic.  She provided a few good suggestions for the meals and was very quick to keep our glasses full.\n\nI had the Chicken Marsala w/ wild rice and vegetables (I have added a picture), and my wife had the Petite Filet.  Her meal was fantastic as I was able to swipe a piece or two of her steak.  It was perfectly cooked and was very tender.  Kudos to the chef. Mine was even better than the photo.  The chicken was tender, the marsala sauce was perfect, and had just the right blend of mushrooms to bring out the delightful flavors and it even smelled as wonderful.\n\nThis is definitely on the short list as it was very solid in its food,the staff, and the service.\n\nOh heck, I only gave it four stars, but believe me, it may be worthy of the 5th.\n\nI will be back.......and I am hoping it will be as wonderful.\n\nI would strongly recommend this place. If you have heard of this place and can't find it, it is because it is behind the Fresh Market off of Providence Road and has only one road into its location, it is not like you will just stumble upon it, you must search it out.\n\nRemember to mention Yelp, and you get 10% off your bill.\n\nNCFoodGuy"
0,"What can I say? This is a very typical chain restaurant. Sure, you can enjoy a meal there, but for the price, you can probably find something better. Their service is spotty. I have been greeted by the owner of the place once, but that's when the place is almost empty. When it gets busy, that's another story. My soup, which was supposed to come before my main course, came after it. Not only that, the waitress tripped and spilled water all over the table. I'm not blaming her, but they should really hire more people to accommodate the high seasons during school years."
0,went there during christmas week. line for lunch was 2 1/2 hours long.  Nothing spectacular...everything was below average other than prime rib & king crab leg.  such a waste of $ & tummy.  definitely would not recommend to anyone.
1,"The holy grail of tacos... Believe the hype. This is the end all be all of my happiness for food. Best tacos ever, hands down. The exterior of the restaurant is a little rough looking and isn't very visible from the road. Also, I do wish the menu was more descriptive in regards to what the tacos were garnished with ect. Our food came out quickly and the service was good. Overall this was win and I can't wait to return. \n\nItems Ordered:\n(Tacos) Shrimp, chorizo, fish & crane asada \n\nCarne asada quesadilla with a side of rice and black beans."
0,Bought a groupon for $59.00 oil change and front brake service. I Called  a couple of times to discuss the work and how long it would take the. Told me weekends are first come first serve and we do not give out the information of how long it would take the work to be done.\nThe guy's name over the phone is Rudy. I know how to work on cars. Based on simplicity I knew right away not to deal with this place. And the phone skills what a joke. Returned my groupon and probably spared myself from B.S. on top of B.S. No thanks. Word to the wise check yelp and get a feel of the person over the phone and how they response to your questions before you buy a deal to have your car serviced.
0,Gross everything
0,"Veal pasta kept sticking to roof of my mouth & hard to chew. Catered to larger group near us, we asked for check multiple times and they were kind but we didn't receive it for at least 10 mins after.  Seem gracious but lack in the attentive dept."
1,"Was stoked when I saw they were replacing the dead Coco's Bakery by my house with a Mexican restaurant.  I actually was waiting for it to open, and finally went in after I saw the new LED sign out front had power.\n\nThe first time I ordered my usual Mexican dish, chicken burrito with rice and cheese.  It wasn't even on the menu, but they made it anyway.  It was above average, but also very overpriced at $11 or $12.\n\nThe second time I went, I brought my roommates and we let the waiter make recommendations for dishes since their menu was so robust.  Everything they brought us was delicious, and my roommates aren't the easiest people to please when eating fancier dishes than McDonald's.\n\nIt's a little weird being in a nicer restaurant when I know it used to be a Coco's, but they're doing a good job with the restaurant.  I'll have to go back soon."
1,"FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!! I went w/my buddy who was buying, a good start. we started w/a martini my pal asked for a olive stuffed w/blue cheese the bartender said he did not have one but would have the chef stuff a couple........NICE......we had the scallop dish,duck,foisga and somthig else I forget a nice bottle of wine we split the cream brulee for desert and then the bar tender offered us a taste of absenth nice touch.....excellent food,service and ambieance          a little pricey but well worth it"
0,"I love authentic mexican so when this place opened I was tempted to try it! i was not impressed! i ordered chicken tacos. When I received my order it was a big plate of onions with some chicken pieces in it, I hate onions by the way. I tried to flag the waitress down but was too busy chatting with a coworker. We were never asked how anything was or if we needed anything so I never got to tell them I didn't like what I ordered. I ended up not eating it and our drinks never got refilled. I was not impressed! The tortillas were obviously premade from a bag because they broke as soon as you touched them! I will not be returning and the name is quite misleading! This by far is not authentic mexican food! I would not recommend."
1,"Deliciousness! Fresh ingredients, awesome atmosphere, fun decor, and great service. When you order a coffee based drink it comes with complimentary coffee-art!"
1,Super low key area. You'd never know this place was here unless you were actively searching for it yourself. I had the vanilla custard in a cone. So creamy and sweet = exactly what you need in the LV of summer
0,"No, No, No just don't go here. Gave my husbands expensive suit in to be dry cleaned and my mistake I gave it in with the hanger, not a cheap plastic one like they gave me back. The lady I picked it up from said it did not have a hanger with it, given she was not who I handed it in to I was surprised at her rude and adamant demeanor. Did not even check with any one flat out refused and said that's how it came in. Make matters worse I had to get it dry cleaned again elsewhere as they did not do a good job, creases where there should not have been. Total Disappointment."
0,"Like Steve S. on 12/27, I'm a former Phoenix local.  We've stayed at the Pointe Squaw Peak in the past, and had a lovely stay.  I didn't remember if it was that or Tapatio Cliffs, so we went ahead and reserved here.\n\nThe good:  The grounds are beautiful, and you can walk from your room into the Phoenix Mountain Preserves.  The dinner at the less formal of the two restaurants was surprisingly good. We loved sitting with our coffee beside the pool in the morning, even if it was a little chilly.  The folks who ran the Starbucks in the lobby were great.  The kids loved the waterfall pool.\n\nThe rooms were awful.  Underground.  Musty.  Backed up toilets.  Car bumpers and headlights at eye level in the bedroom.  Why bother with little patios that are dirt and mostly underground?  There is inadequate upkeep.  My son's hand was suddenly bloody on the way back from the pool when he put his hand on the rail.  We were two families with kids, but we were put next to the adult pool, which the kids were forbidden to enter, so the other pools were a long trek and we were unable to get out of our caves, be near the rooms, and be with the kids.\n\nThey never made it clear that the resort fee covered internet.  There were no explanations at check-in.  They mostly seemed to want us gone.  \n\nThe worst, though, was our attempt to do laundry.  If the hotel doesn't want people doing their own laundry, they shouldn't pretend that they do.  First, they don't offer change for the coin op laundry.  Then, to get to the laundry, we had to go into the pool area to access an elevator, up the elevator, across a sky bridge, up two flights of stairs, then across a road.  I was embarrassed when I accepted a ride from the bell staff until I saw how far it was.  \n\nThe first laundry room they drove me to had the coin box ripped off the machine.  Twisted metal where it belonged.  Really.  Wires hanging out.  At a 4-star resort.  Neither the driver nor the front desk clerk seemed fazed by the theft and vandalism.\n\nThe second laundry room was ok until the second load.  The water ran briefly, just enough to wet the clothes.  Then it hummed.  No water, no washing.  Again, the front desk staff was unconcerned that our morning was ruined, while we waited 3 hours for someone to deal with the broken washer.  At the end of 3 hours, I managed to get water into the washer on my own (turned out there was hot water, but no cold).  No one ever showed to fix it.\n\nIt seemed that they chose their front desk staff based on how cute or \""done\"" they look, not on their ability to give customer service.  What a disappointment."
1,"So I've only been here once, but DEFINITELY plan on coming back soon! I came to the Clarendon on NYE for their big party. I got to the hotel early I could enjoy dinner with a couple friends.\nI unfortunately got their a bit late so I missed the queso cicherone and guac which I heard were amazing. I had some sangria to drink and it was great. It was like drinking punch. We split some soft tacos which we intended to have as appetizers, but they were sssoooo good we ordered many more and had them as our meal. \nWe first ordered a few each of the pork belly, carnitas and carne asada tacos. They were so good but our favorite was definitely the carne asada. Perfectly seasoned and cooked they needed nothing more than a dab of their spiciest salsa for a little extra oomph. I could have eaten them all day, but alas we had some partying to do.\nAnother important aspect to any meal is the quality of service and the service here was definitely great!\nI can't wait to come back"
0,Was a customer almost daily until today...I got the teriyaki bowl with vegetables and rice and come to find out that the bowl was recycled. Not the bowl itself the rice. There is rice with sauce and vegetables in the bottom then there's another layer of smash rice then the veggies and the chicken...adding picture
0,"Love the bagels but the customer service at this location is very poor. I have come in more than once, not during rush, to have them remark that they are out of ____. No apology. Just the facts. \n\nWhen ordering to go, have on more than one occasion, waited more than 15 min. Will probably not return, took awhile, but I've learned my lesson.... Voting with my dollar."
0,"We popped in for a quick bite and ordered the chicken cheesesteak and turkey pesto panini. Chicken is seasoned well, but the panini and salad are AWFUL!!!! 1st and last time for us! Lettuce is wilted and tastes dirty.  Asked for no onions twice and they are piled on! Out of steak and most drinks in the fountain drink dispenser. The dressing tastes like it is all vinegar. Way too pricey ($30) for the quality of the food!!! Save your time and money...."
0,Some of the worst breakfast combined with poor service has made me avoid this place for the rest of my life.
0,"i saw a ton of 5 star reviews o this place, including one from a friend of mine, and it is basically next door to gold bar so i decided to try a bacon cheeseburger. the service was fair at best- the girl that took my order obviously wasn't listening to me and got attitude when i repeated what i wanted. i thought the burgers were cooked to order but obviously not. after she took my order, she came out from behind the counter and sat on her phone and the cook gave me my food. now to the burger: it was grey. yes, grey and greasy. the grilled onions were good but the \""lobby's sauce\"" seems to be taco seasoning, ketchup, and mayo. i was so unimpressed that i doubt i'll use the check in offer i got to try something else"
1,"As a theme park and water park fan,\n\nI actually drove 4 hours from Los Angeles to check out the new Cowbunga Bay water park. which is located about 10 miles east of  the Vegas strip.\n\nI was a tad disappointed to learn before arriving that they are still in the process of constructing 2 or 3 water slides. I thought they have the whole last year and this year to complete the park. Oh well.\n\nSince the park is still missing 3 main attractions, they decided to lower the price by $6 for adult. \n\nAnyway, we went on a Thursday, a week after it opened. Parking was $5. I was expecting huge crowd like at Wet n Wild, but to my surprise it was no where as crowded as I had thought. Almost all the slides were a walk-on during the early morning into mid-afternoon hours. I overheard one of the lifeguards told the another guest that this was one of the slowest day since it opened a week ago. It may be due to the fact that it was cloudy and looked like it was going to rain.\n\nThe longest we waited for a slide was on Zuma ZOOMa. I would have to say this ride is the only extreme water slide in the park. It has a trap door underneath you, that will drop you in 5 seconds once you step in and they close the glass door. It was very thrilling. \n\nHere's a point of view video I shot of this Zuma ZOOMA trap door body slide:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMDqgckVUoo\n\nFood is a bit pricey since it's an amusement park. What do you expect? they need to make money somehow since most of the guests are season pass holder, they pay once and get to come back as often as they want. So in order to stay in business, they need to boost up their prices on food.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this park! It's so vivid and colorful. I can't wait to come back next summer when everything is completed and they have planted more trees and shrubs.  \n\nI don't know why, but I love Cowabunga Bay more than Wet N Wild Las Vegas. \n\nBy the way, here's a video showing a FULL Complete Tour of Cowabunga Bay Las Vegas for those who wants to see how it looks like before going\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmOs8Sc5tm0"
1,Major Upgrade to this gym!
0,This is horrible. Got the lemon chicken. It's a patty of country fried chicken with lemon sauce. It's horrible. Took 20 minutes to get my food and the egg roll is cold.  I'm dining in. Save your money.
0,"Except the car is in good sharp, there is no customer service.  When I was at different lane to get out, the AVIS associates was sitting at the gate without walk to my lane and check me out.  Instead, I have to back the car, move to the lane they were sat.  Speak with horrible tone and rude.  Moreover, they said if I pass 1 min of my return time, they will charge me for a extra day.  Avoid AVIS, Hertz gave me much better experiences."
1,"I visited Fix over 2 years ago (May 2007). While pricey (hey is anything at the Bellagio not pricey), the Fix was an amazing experience. \n\nLove their hip decor, from the dark colors to the lighting, the chairs and even their dinnerware. \n\nService was friendly although a little haughty. \n\nI ordered the halibut and can safely say it has been the best halibut I have ever had. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out if you want to enjoy good food and good looking people."
0,"The theme of today's Yelp is: Know Thyself.\n\nKnow thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.\n\nKnow thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.\n\nFurthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose \""for here,\"" I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.\n\nKnow thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.\n\nHere is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.\n\nDon't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.\n\n--------\n\nMy wife read the review, and by \""read\"" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right."
1,"This buffet is absolutely delicious!!  I advise everyone to go try this buffet out at least a few times.  The thing that I don't agree with is the price.  Although, the buffet was delicious, I don't feel that it was worth he price.  If it was about 7 bucks less, I would have absolutely no complaints about this buffet!"
0,"Everything on paper looks perfect.  We waited 45 minutes for a table that never came.  Called before I got there to make sure it wasn't too bad.  I was told to expect a 20 minute wait.  No biggie.  After a 45 minute wait, I was told another 30 were required.  Had tickets to Tosh so I had to leave.  Thank goodness for the magic speed the brothers from Los Dos Molinos put on their chile rellenos.  It was like they were crossing the Rio Grande all over again.  Screw SB1070,  I need mexican food anyways!\n\nFood may be good, but I'll never know now."
1,"This place is dirt cheap! I usually spend about 80 for two people when I go here whereas I usually spend 160 at Copps or Hyvee. They have a huge selection of everything, I can find things here that I can't find at other grocery stores, like low sodium string cheese and certain veggie burgers. Yes, it has some flaws, it can be a zoo on the weekend and can be a bit messy, but the price and selection is worth it. The only true complaint I have is the produce can be pretty crappy. Sometimes I have to go somewhere else if I need a lot of produce or certain things that I know will be bad at Woodmans. And no, they don't take credit but they do take debit which is just fine for me."
1,Came here with my mommy friends after shopping at 4pm..no line. Sweet! We were sat down quickly and our server was on top of waters & drinks for all of us.\nWe tried so many different kinds of sushi. I could not find fault with any of them.\nEven the desserts were amazing. My only issue was our waitress disappeared around time for dessert so we had to ask another server to send her over.\nIf there would not have been such a delay..and we did wait a bit..I would have given them 5 stars.\nI will be back again soon though.
0,"Horrendous from beginning to end, I had an appointment for 8:00 AM to get lab work done, it was 1 hr and 15 minutes after my appointment time before I was called back, close to 3 people who came in after me went before me. The place itself is dirty, crowded, and noisy. \n\nI wonder what is the point of making an appointment when it still takes over an hour to get in? There was a man who came in without one and they told him it would take an hour. So really what is the point?"
1,"JUst gets better and better. This time stopped in for afternoon Coffee and dessert. AMAZING OF COURSE!!!! Really, really great dark roast thick yummy coffee like I like. Vanilla bean scoop ice cream and freshly cooked HUGE chocolate chip cookie.Made my whole trip to Vegas!! This place is my staple. Normal prices, not strip prices. Plus, in the middle of a HUGE DTLV makeover. Can't wait!! I'm so in!!!"
1,"Hooters wings is in my top 5 favorite things to eat, so of course I spent the very first hours of 2014 here. The line was long, but we got seated within 10 minutes. The server was sweet and the food came out quickly.  Got my faves the classic buffalo wings, boneless wings, and buffalo shrimp, it tasted like Hooters. Nothing really to complain about :) If you don't like salty food, don't get the Parmesan Garlic cause that shit is salty."
1,"Just based on the smoothie bar. \n\nNow I know better just to ask for my pill if I wanted energizer and take it orally. I didn't know you could do that before until I saw someone before has done it. \n\nMonkey Rush is the only drink i order and the only drink that uses fruits (bananas). \n\nAlso, would be nice if they fill it up to the rim, bc at times, they would toss 1/8 from the blender into the sink...if you're going to dump it, why not overflow my cup."
0,"Holy overpriced!  With everyone all abuzz about this place opening up in AZ, I figured we would have to give it a try sometime.  Well, we were out and about in the EV this weekend and figured now was as good as ever.  Things did not start off well.  First, the music was so LOUD!  Some poor old lady walked in and covered her ears the second the door opened.  I also hated the peanut shells.  It was stupid, poorly executed and had no business being in a fast food burger joint.  Steakhouse or BBQ place, maybe, but not here.  Apparently the ordering system is difficult because it took the 6 or so people in front of us forever to order, but for us smart folk, it takes about 30 seconds.\n\nNow to the food.  It costs 4.89 for a single patty bacon cheeseburger.  I can get a Baconator combo at Wendy's for that price.  That's just the burger here, so for an extra 2.59 I can get frys (a generous portion at least) and another couple bucks gets me a drink.  I'm practically pushing a 10 dollar combo here!  This is fast food right?  I couldn't help but compare it to In'N'Out and this place was failing miserably!  Our food came out in roughly 5-8 minutes and we went outside to eat because the music was unbearably loud.  The frys were decent, nothing to special and I found the cajun fries to be very dry feeling in my mouth.  The burger was such a disappointment.  It was small and very smashed when I opened it.  The meat was very well done, and not juicy like they said it should be.  The bacon was decent and the cheese was well, cheese.  Overall, a pretty lame burger, especially for nearly 5 bucks!\n\nObviously, I was disappointed.  I know 5 bucks for a burger isn't a lot, but for fast food, it really is.  It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers, because this place is not good.  This place is definitely a fail for me, but at least my food was edible."
1,"This was my first time here and I really liked their menu a lot.  If you order ala carte, it's a little pricey and you might as well order all you can eat.  Their burrito hand roll thing is AWESOME!  (BEST DAMM THING ON THE MENU) The service is just fine.  I did however find out that they are open til 2 a.m. (I didn't realize they were open that late though)  When I stopped in at approx 12:45 a.m. on Tuesday night to place a to go order, there wasn't a single person in there.  I was surprised because my other 4 sushi places I visit late at night always have a crowd in there late night. \n\nSo PLEASE people don't underestimate this place.  It's a good place, great variety and the quality of the sushi is good.  It's not great or better then any place else but it's good and I've been to far far far worse places."
0,"What is the deal with this place?  I had driven by numerous times and seen the sparkling reviews on yelp, so I figured that i would stop in.  The wife and I headed over on a Saturday night, and we walk in to find a very cozy, non-descript, not very formal looking restaurant.  It was mainly empty despite being a Saturday.  I was expecting something a little more formal, or a little more original, or more of something.  But that`s ok, I can deal with generic every once in a while.  Then I checked out the menu - and I was shocked by the premium prices that they were charging - 15-25 dollars per entree.  Everything comes with a generic salad and the portions are quite large, but the food was as generic  as the ambience.  I should have had the foresight to know that hummus in a place like this is not the best choice.  The service was fine, people were friendly, but  I can get much tastier food at Dish or the Diamond for about half the price."
0,its 6 month's later  and i still hate this resturant ... i want my money back plus the day i wasted at the excalibur..... this place is a EPIC FAIL
1,"Glad I don't have to go all the way to NY for a frozen hot chocolate. Yes the name sounds ironic but it is what it sounds like. Hot chocolate but frozen. \n\nI noticed they had other flavors which I'll have to try when I go back. The best thing about this place is, it's outside and has Togo service!\n\nDon't have to go thru the trouble of getting thru a casino to get this dessert drink.\n\nLocated at the CP's casino."
0,The food is just okay. I have had better. Service is slow.
0,I dont mind fresh and hot...but when you have to wait 15 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to receive the order plus bad attitude....not a good mix\nTry two cashiers when you got 4 people or more in one line...that would cut the first 15 minutes
1,I love this place! The staff here are always friendly and the online reservation works great. Today on our reservation I didnt realize that I accidently picked tomorrows date. But the hostless worked with us and was able to squeeze us in instead of making us wait an hour and a half. The food is always amazing and thr salad bar has a ton of options. Management will stop by your table and ask you how dinner is and if theres anything they can do for you. I like how their customer service is. Great for large parties too!
1,"Love this Restaurant. The food is authentic.  Remember, make sure you order Hunan dish like Hunan dried pork."
0,"Go to classic car spa if you want to spend too much money on a crappy car wash. I have been going to this location for the past couple years, and it has been bought out and/or taken over by new ownership a couple times.   I used to get great service and a high quality wash, but lately it has been beyond disappointing. The sales people push you to upgrade your service, and then the extra you pay for doesn't get done.    In the past I would go there for an oil change, but got so frustrated by the mechanics trying to sell me on $300 in \""necessary\"" services every time.   So I deciding to go to NAPA for my oil change, and asked them to look into some of the recommended services that Classic had pushed.... None of them needed to be done, seriously!!!\n\nMy last time visit (yesterday) was the final straw for me.  I asked the sales lady how long the basic wash would take and she said 15-20 minutes.  Then she said if I upgrade the premium it would only take an extra 5 minutes and I would get a complete interior dressing opposed to the standard wipe down and vacuum. So I went with this option (+$9).   45 minutes later my car was done and I took a quick look inside and they didn't even wipe down the center consol.   I asked the guy to take care of this, so he did and then I get in my car and drive away... as I am driving I look at the dash and dashboard and realize they didn't even wipe certain areas and there was definitely no \""dressing\"".  They essentially gave me a half-ass basic car wash, charged me for a premium and took twice as long as they promised.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!"
0,"Bad food,, very slow service. Did I say over priced. Save your money eat somewhere else.\n.basic hamburger taste bad. How does this place stay in business."
0,Sign outside says rated best dim sum in 2010. Well alot must have changed in 3 years. I would highly disagree..lol I was sub par at best with lack of flavor and cooking time of certain dishes that need to be cooked longer for the meats/ tendons/ and or other organs to property become consistance of how the traditional dim sum dish is suppose to be.\n\nThe service was a bit lacking as well
1,Can we say big daddy's sauce is da bomb! A vegetarian is saying this mind you. Fried pickles are the kosher pickle kind with the crispy breading with addictive non valley's ranch ranch dip YUM! All of a sudden the queen of will power is bumming tater tots off her co-workers plates. Not a coincidence my friends the food is worth the wait in line at lunch. Not to mention a tater tot dip in big daddy's sauce. Seriously love the place. Sometimes I hate the sub-par service but I will keep going back for more. It is hard to get burger fans and vegetarians to agree on a place for lunch. This place is it. On a side note for those meat eaters the meat is hormone free and grass fed burgers. Hooray!
0,"What a huge disappointment. I could have had a better meal at the bistro around the corner. The pork tenderloin dish was a big mess -- literally: The dish was a pile of flavorless mashed sweet potatoes with some cold meat on top. It looked as if Mom let 6-year-old Billy make his own plate for the first time. My husband's sea bass was nicely flavored and tender, but we've had better. The rest of the meal wasn't even memorable. The mac and cheese side dish was a huge letdown, but then so was the whole experience."

Everyone there was pretty nice and came in to check on me, etc.\n\nWindow was replaced and I took off. I rolled the window down and noticed that the motor was labored.

I rolled it back up and the window does not roll into the groove (it rolls up OUTSIDE the door).\n\nI drove back and talked to the manager/supervisor and he said \""that isn't right.\"" He sent an installer out and the installer said that the wrong brackets were on it. I could come back Monday, but I couldn't so Thursday it is.\n\nI would think that part of the installation would be to roll the window up and \n\nOTHER: When I got in my car I was greeted with a somewhat messy area.

Also, my LED light in my door is disconnected.\n\nAs of right now I'm not all that impressed with the work. We will see if come Thursday if they get it right."
0,"Have stayed here and there's much to do inside with casinos going on forever, many restaurants, bars and stores. The hotel towers are many so the place is busy with activity and people.\n\nThe group I went with, like 15 people, had similar comments. The rooms were run down and not that clean. The maid service had just left my room upon my arrival. I saw her leave my room. There were wadded up Kleenex balls right outside my room and she just walked by them. Gross. I thought maybe she just didn't see them. On the third day there, I'm pretty sure someone in housekeeping had to have seen them but they were still there. \n\nI was there on business so it was hard to tolerate hearing slamming hotel doors ALL night long and partiers yelling down the hallways at 3,4 or 5AM with no regard to others.\n\nSummary: if you're there to party and gamble and are OK with semi clean rooms, this is the place for you."
1,"I like this place. When giving ratings to sushi restaurants in Madison, it's always hard to know if I should base it on a Madison scale or a national scale. In other words, if Sushi Muramoto delivered the same quality sushi in california, they'd probably only get three stars. But being that we're in the midwest, they deserve their four stars. I'd have to say that Sushi Muramoto is one of only two sushi places in town that serves decent quality fish.\n\nMy only complaints about the food are: 1. the red sauce they put on the bottom of some rolls is WAY too overwhelmingly spicy. It takes away from the taste of the roll. 2. you could tell that they used the shittier hamachi for the negihama roll compared to just the yellowtail sushi. I love love love yellowtail so I'll usually get two pieces of sushi as well as a yellowtail+scallion roll. There was a noticeable difference in the quality of fish they used for each :( Also, 3. I ordered coke and got pepsi. I know it's not THAT big of a deal but it's a big pet peeve of mine, so I thought I'd mention it anyway. Read my tagline. I hate pepsi.\n\nBut this place gets gold stars for not being overpriced. I feel like some of the more upscale sushi places can get away with charging outrageous prices for items that should be cheap (e.g. miso soup or inari). Here, I found that they don't really do that. So props to them.\n\nThe restaurant has a good vibe and a cool lounge you can hang out in while you're waiting for your table, which you'll probably have to do. I'd definitely come back."
1,"This was a stop during our downtown graduation bar crawl and I will definitely be back.  The place is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but it is squished in the small downtown area. It has an outdoor patio area, and inside bar, and the lounge itself is in the shape of a long and narrow rectangle.\n\nI really like the minimalist decor and atmosphere.  During their happy hour, 4-7PM, the inside of the bar is really well lit and it's actually quite refreshing.  Happy hour consisted of 1/2 of well drinks and $1 off beers (according to our bartender although it states 1/2 of well drinks, beer, and wine everywhere online), not the best I've had but I'll take it.\n\nI must say, I was a huge fan of the music they were playing.  Their playlist certainly touched my hipster heartstrings. \n\nAlso, they have a portion of a wire fence hanging on a wall in the lounge.  This mimics the lover's bridge in Paris where you can buy/bring a lock, sign yours and your lover's name on it, lock it onto the fence, throw away the key, and forever symbolize your eternal love for one another (that is, until they cut the locks off or take down the fence).  But it was romantic nonetheless.  Two friends actually bought a lock (I don't know from where but it had to have been nearby on Fremont) and locked their love on the fence. Cute."

1,"I just moved to the area 2 months ago and was looking all over yelp for a good, reputable dog groomer. I'm so happy I chose Villa La Paws! The price to get my dog all cleaned up and shaved, the works, was so reasonable. Very pleased with the work and how happy my dog was when I came to pick her up. They also were very accommodating to time a time constraint with me and had her done in time for me to pick her up before I had to work. The groomer was also happy to greet her when we arrived. Would recommend this place to anyone!"
0,If I could give it zero stars I would. I am not going waste any more of my time with this establishment. They just suck.

I like getting gel manicures- they are quick, steady hands, and I am in and out within 30-60 minutes. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get pretty busy but you can also just walk in if you have some time to wait."

Donc pour ce prix ils se servent des aliments fabriqu\u00e9s ailleurs est livr\u00e9 pr\u00e9parer ailleurs et pr\u00eat pour la cuisson. \n\nJe r\u00e9sume aussi la client\u00e8le comme \u00e9tant des jeunes filles qui commencent \u00e0 sortir en ville seules et qui retrouvent l'extase dans ce restaurant. \n\nLe restaurant est quand m\u00eame le seul endroit pour sortir en famille sur Saint-Laurent durant la soir\u00e9e \n\nEn somme il devrait revoir les prix et les menus."
1,"I thought Bite was great! There were some \""cheesy\"" moments, but overall I liked it! The girls were all awesome dancers and the one that did the acrobats from the ceiling was incredible!! \n\nI disagree with the viewer that said the girls were ugly. I thought they all showed great personality and were \""sexy.\"" I'd like to see that viewer get up and do a tenth of what those girls were doing. The fact that the one dancer could climb to the ceiling on a cloth was amazing. I thought that was the best part of the show!!\n\nI do agree, the service sucks. Show was 1/4 over before the waitress made her way to our table. If you wants drinks, buy them at the bar outside the showroom before you are seated.\n\nWe bought the 2 for 1 tickets, seating is great throughout the showroom. Paid $80 for two tickets. I wouldn't have paid that per ticket, though. \n\nIt was a fun evening and the music was awesome (I was an 80's teenager) and I sang along to almost all of the songs.\n\nGo see Bite, its a good time."
0,"This place represents everything that is phony about the city that boasts plastic surgeons that accept payments on a layaway plan and a Costco with a $23k bottle of Louis XIII on display. The moment we walked into this place I sensed an air of pretension.\n\nWe were meeting friends for what I had hoped would be a wonderful evening of catching up.  Unfortunately, the techno music thumping from the speakers overhead pretty much ruled that out.  Perhaps a younger crowd (I'm a young 54) enjoys music that allows you to hear only the words that your date utters between the electronic bass notes, but I really prefer to hear everything that someone is taking the time to share with me.\n\nWhat should one think of a so-called champagne lounge that is out of your first choice of bubbly?  It's not like I chose an obscure or rare bottle of champagne.  I selected Schramsburg Blanc de Blanc, a very delicious, but readily available non-vintage California sparkling. There is no reason to run out of such a wine.\n\nThe food was also nothing to speak of.  Early on a Friday evening they were already out of the tenderloin carpacio.  How do you run out of tenderloin carpacio? Did the slicer break down, or did you really run out of meat suitable to eat unless cooked through? The chilled white prawns were good, but those are pretty hard to get wrong. Don't think by their presence on the happy hour menu that you're getting a good deal.  They sell them for $3 per, and so if you get four you save a whole dollar.  Wow!  The grilled vegetable platter that we shared was pretty good.\n\nThe couple of things that I would highly NOT recommend are the cheese plate and the bacon wrapped matzo balls.  A couple of the cheeses on the plate were OK, but most of them were nothing special.  No brie, no triple creme, no bleu.  There was one cheese that tasted like the low fat mozzarella that I use to make an ordinary pizza.  It was not worth the price that we paid.  Regarding the matzo balls, I have to ask, what's the point of wrapping bacon around matzo? Shrimp, yes; date, yes; chicken liver, yes; matzo ball, definitely no."
0,"There are only a hand full of places worse than this and I came across them when I visited third world countries. The room reaked of smoke and who knows what else. The laundry and ice maker were broken and the pool was closed. The TV is an ancient 4x3 tube set, no HDTV.  The place seems to be a permanent dwelling for crack heads and Craigslist whores and did not feel like a safe environment for my family."
1,"I had a comp ticket to see this show last night and I'm glad I went.  It was a very good show and I learned something about some of the rock music that I didn't follow.  While I liked the entire show, my favorite part was the early numbers--The Doors, The Who and the Rolling Stones.  When the Woodstock era ended and we sadly put away our bell bottoms, I took a different musical direction.  While I knew many of the songs when I heard them, I could no more identify the name of the song nor the band if Raiding the Rock Vault had not projected the names onto the large screens on stage and on the wings of the theatre.\n\nMy email about my ticket advised me that the show was LOUD! (sic).  I took a pair of ear plugs with me just in case, and while the show was loud, it didn't blow me away nor did anyone near me mind the loudness.  To me, it was a standard concert loudness.\n\nPeriodically, the screens would display historic information about the group or song that was being sung.  I found this very helpful because I learned as I listened.  Most of the people in the audience were younger than me and most knew almost every word to every song.  I was lucky if I could understand the words they were singing let alone know them to sing with the band.  \n\nI have nothing but good things to say about the quality of the playing and singing.  The band is fantastic.  There's a small story to get the show started--a little goofy--but it serves its purpose and I liked it.  As the show goes along, there are periodic pauses when some of the group does some speaking parts/skits on the sides of the stage.  It's a bit corny, but it too is OK.  It moves the show along from one era to another.\n\nI single out for special attention Tracii Guns and Howard Leese on guitar.  Wow are they good!  The box office person gave me a great seat, the 4th row center, but part of the center section begins with the 3rd row because they've built a ramp for the performers to stand when featuring them.  It was a great seat (see my photos).  As for vocals, the two I enjoyed the most were Andrew Freeman and Robin McAuley.  John Payne, a singer and the producer, was also very good.  \n\nThe lighting for the show was very well done and the laser light effects were quite good!  And a word about the LVH Theatre.  Since I was there the last time, they have redone the room.  The old wooden seats are gone and have been replaced with newer seats with cushioning.  They're fairly comfortable.  Also, as stated above, they've built out the front, center of the stage and if you're lucky to get a ticket in that area, you have a great view of the performers up close.  Regardless, the venue has 4 large screens that display the action so anyone can see well.  Since you're here for the music, you really don't have to see them that up close either.\n\nI recommend this show very highly especially if you're a fan of rock music of the 70s and 80s.  I think it's a bit long at exactly two hours, but it certainly is an entertaining two hours with very talented musicians.  \n\nAfter seeing this show at the historic LVH Showroom, you know that Elvis has left the building.  And so has Manilow."
0,"Okay maybe out east our fake beef is tastier or something but this was hands down the worst Taco Bell I've ever had. \n\nFirst off, they messed up our order but being hungry and having a grumpy toddler yelling in our ears, we didn't bother to correct it. \n\nSecond, the steak in the chalupas my husband ordered was extremely bland and the chalupa bread was bitter like it was old or fried in bad oil or whatever they do to that. The \""beef\"" in my soft taco was the right color and consistency but was also flavorless. Stranger still was the normally soft tortilla wrap was crispy on the edges but soaked through everywhere else. How long had it been sitting there anyways? \n\nHmmm, hoping that not ALL the Taco Bells in Arizona suck. But thankfully with all the Mexican food around, it shouldn't be hard to find decent tacos elsewhere."
0,"We were told that it was amazing at night when they had the chinese garden lit up. I wouldn't know because we never got in. They had 3 cashiers for a line that stretched at from one end of the park to the other and out into the parking lot (easily 1/2 mile, maybe more). Apparently, they have this issue judging from what people in line were saying. They should get some temporary cashiers for really busy times when they know they are going to be slammed."
0,Food is good (not great) but the loudest music ever. Couldn't hear the waiter. I have been to this location several times because its close to the office. Do not like the experience inside the place. I think I'm done with this location
1,I adore the staff at this place!! Great food as well.
1,"Great pancakes!  Great bacon too!  This place is really good.  Kid friendly too.  We had to wait about 10 min or so but not bad because this place is busy,  really busy.  THis is a sign of a good place when everyone goes there.  I would go back.  Give this place a try.  it's worth the wait if you even have to."
0,"We were looking forward to trying out Honey & Salt. We live down the street and have friends who know the owners who have said it is a great new spot. We arrived at 6 p.m. and there were about 1/3 of the tables empty. We asked if we could have a table for 4 for dessert and drinks and they said they would not seat us if we would not be eating a full dinner. The owner said if we came at 5 they \""might\"" have seated us. Out of principle, we won't be coming back to this restaurant. As nice as it looks, the service was rude, disappointing and gave the impression that they are snooty and want only a certain type of customer. They must have enough business as a new restaurant to be turning people away when they have empty tables."
0,"We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.\n\nThe location was good, although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that our shower wasn't clean. The walls in the rooms were thin; we could hear our neighbor's dog barking, as well as other people using their showers/bathrooms.\n\nOverall, for what we needed the room for (sleeping after a show), it was fine. But with the thin walls, expensive parking, and the dirty bathroom, i'd never stay at this place again. I've had better experiences in smaller, cheaper hotels."
1,"Love it! The shrimp burritos are the best I've ever had. Also, the chicken tortilla soup is to die for. Pentiful baskets of thin/crispy chips and good but, not to hot, salsa are on your table immediately. (you can ask for hotter if you need to)\n\nOutdoor tables-however are in a parking lot area.\n\nHeard the atmosphere is better at the other Salsa's location on Carmel Road but, haven't made it there yet."
0,"The only reason why this place gets two stars is because the service was good, very friendly and prompt.  It does not, however, make up for the fact that the food was terrible.\n\nIf you have \""mozzarella bar\"" in your name you should know how to make good mozz, not the tough tasteless slabs we had on our cheese plate.  The poor shrimp on my pasta entree were cooked past the point of no return.  The bolognese sauce had no flavor, and even the house made pasta, arguably the best part of the meal, was slightly overcooked.  You're way better off going to The Parlor right across the street.  The prices are the same and the quality is so much better."
0,"Been there several times. I want to really like this place, but cant. Food is great, but i dont care for the atmosphere. Seats are uncomfortable and seems the tables are really crammed in. I know this isnt their fault, but parking lot always crowded and busy. Pizza is very good, but evrything else is frustrating."
0,"Zero stars if possible.  The management here stinks.  I have been going to Embassy for years and this is one of the worse places to go.  I have stayed here in the past and recently, was told that my room was no longer available (after I told them we would be arriving late, not once but twice) and still my room was gone.  Was giving another hotel at their costs but the room for this other hotel was so bad, it would of been better I slept in my car.  I complained to Hilton Headquarters as I am a long time Hilton Honors Member and said that management would call.  Management for this Embassy never called.  I was told later by varies folks (other hotel and clerk at Embassy and also corporate) there was more then one complaint and also found out that this Embassy tends to overbook.  Please at least send us to a hotel has was comparable to Embassy and not one that has bad reviews.  Never will I stay at this hotel...I will find something else...I suggest the DoubleTree Downtown...they are MUCH better and less expensive."
1,"came here at 11:30 pm on a tuesday night and even though the ratings seemed a bit sketchy i decided to give it a try. my friend got the french toast and i got the steak special! 14oz rib eye w/ veggies and a baked potato for $14! crazy!!! \n\nthe service was a bit slow, but our waitress was as attentive as she could have been (she had A LOT of tables on her own)\n\nour food came out in 20 mins and the steak was surprisingly great! cooked to  perfect medium well! i couldn't even finish 1/2 of the steak...my friend had to come to the rescue lol.\n\nhonestly i would say if you're in the area give it a chance! and remember the steak special! 12 am-5am :D"
1,"We were recommended Cashman Brothers through our venue, Emerald at Queensridge. Cashman Brothers is amazing. Great experience with staff overall and our photographer was amazing. He did a beautiful job on both our engagement and wedding day photos. We were very impressed! Absolutely recommend!"
1,"two words: bacon bars.\n\nthe guys at the MJ store recommended this store to me a couple years ago, claiming they had THE BEST chocolate. It's located directly across from the MJ store at the Forum shops so I decided to give it a look. Ever since then, this place is one of the few stores I make it a point to hit up when i'm in LV. They have a wide assortment of gourmet chocolate, including green tea, spicy, wasabi (yes, wasabi), goji berry, hazelnut (in their gianduja bar), and well, you get the picture. I can't say I'm a fan of all of their chocolates but it's fun being adventurous and trying new things out.\n\nMy favorite by far is the bacon bar. This is the reason I am giving them 5 stars. I love bacon and I love chocolate. Their bacon bar is so decadent and I always feel a little naughty when I eat it :) It comes in milk chocolate and dark chocolate, and there are tiny little bacon bits in them. They recently came out with a bacon-toffee chocolate bar, which is good too. \n\nThe next time I go back, I definitely want to try the boxed chocolates. The packaging is all purple, which is my favorite color!"
1,"One of my favorite places to visit. For an Uptown spot, the music is usually on point. The guy/girl ratio is pretty good and the women always appear to be above average looking. They get to capacity very fast on the weekend and the line to wait can be very long, usually so long, it goes past Ri-Ra's (the Irish bar next door). Sucks they have a $5 cover, but overall, it's pretty worth it. In closing, this is a really good spot, but you can grow tired of it really fast if you went every weekend. I'd keep my visits to once a month-every few months, so its always enjoyable when you go."
0,"This review is solely based upon the customer service we received at this store. (hint: NONE) \nThe art is BEAUTIFUL - so check it out...but hopefully you will not encounter the employee that was there on Labor Day. Perhaps she didn't want to work on a holiday. Perhaps she had better things to do, but we were not acknowledged...at all...while browsing the merchandise. We were in the store for about 15 minutes and all we could hear was this employee's financial situation - and believe me, she was not being quiet about it! It was downright rude. I had questions on a few pieces that I wanted to purchase that had no prices associated with them, but perhaps I'll try to find them online. I will not go back to that store. Ugh."
0,"We got takeout and it was low quality Mexican.  Chicken was stringy an.d tough, seasonings were very pedestrian. If you like this you're not serious about Mexican"
0,"Can't speak about the quality and taste of the goods they make at Rolling Pin, but boy... do they have rude and unprofessional staff (including the owner). As I was shopping for my wedding cake, and visiting different bakeries - I decided to stop by the Rolling Pin (referred to by my wedding vendor). \n\nWhen I finally made it to the bakery, I asked to talk to someone (just for a few minutes) about the details on ordering a wedding a cake and scheduling a tasting - and all I got in response from the girl by the register is: \""The only person who can speak about the wedding cakes is the owner but she is too busy right now.\"" She told me to come back later or call... How is that for treating a prospective customer? \n\nNeedless to say, I never came back or called back. I am ordering the cake from the Clausen's Bakery in Middleton and very excited for it."
1,"LOVED this place! Low key, chill hangout spot. My favorite part was the mini bar where you are served by midget a bartender. There is an old school juke box in the corner that has a huge selection of old and new hits. There is huge tree swing at the main bar, tins of huge adult drunken games, too many too list/describe. I recomend just getting your booty down there and enjoy yourself! This bar is great for the active, fun adventure seeking type of drunken night! : )"
1,Haley gave us incredible service tonight. Friendly and attentive. Easy on the eyes too.
0,"So sorry to have to update this review, but the last few visits have been less than wonderful. The last time we were there, which is probably the \""last\"" time, my salad was wet/runny, sparse, and overpriced given the quality. It's also taken for-ev-er to have food prepared. I know, it's a small kitchen, so there's that. I'm no longer a fan."
1,"This place offers deals starting at $5.  I bet I spend twice that in water and shampoo alone when I was the car on my own which I always do.  Great service, two attendants outside to pre-wash your car before going in.  After going through the wash you realize it actually washed your car unlike other car washes that make your car look worse than when you got there.  Here's the kicker, after you're done, you have the option to vacuum your car FOR FREE with no time limit."
0,"Went for lunch on 3/21/2014 thinking I just found an awesome new gluten-free, vegetarian place and I walk up to a locked door. No sign, nothing on customer voice mail. Left highly disappointed and hungry."
1,"We came here for brunch, meeting up with my brother-in-law, who lives in town.  We came pretty early in the day, so the place wasn't that busy.  Which meant that our service was excellent.  Our server, Diane, kept on coming by to check on us and refill our drinks.  I ordered the Montecristo sandwich, which was served with a side of maple syrup.  While it may not sound good to many people, it was heaven to this sweet tooth!  \n\nTo counteract this, we ordered a side of garlic fries to share.  While many places do Garlic fries, Gordon Biersch has the best.  The fries were very hot and fresh, with just the right amount of garlic.  Often, places overwhelm this dish with garlic, but not Gordon Biersch.  If you ever grave garlic fries, come here."
1,"Awesome!!!\nI will start with the big negative part of my review: \nLONG ASS WAIT TIME ! only reason 4 and not 5 stars-\nthat is all for the negative.\nPositives:\nMac N Cheese is the best in our solar system. If that is all you get from there you will be pleased.\nThey offer briskett, pork, chicken-pulled/quarters, links. \nThere cold sides are sort of commercial- nothing special though. The cobbler is BOMB as well.\nYou can call in your order but it still takes a bit to get it. \nThe employees are the same for the past 2 years I have been going there which tells me he treats his folks RIGHT!"
1,"The fam and I headed on down to Honey Bears this past Saturday to get our BBQ on! \n\nHoney Bears never disappoints! \n\nI had the shredded BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of the cowboy beans, sooo spicy and delicious! \n\nAlso their french fries may be sent from heaven! SO GOOD! \n\nI always go for the Big Red at the soda machine, that is a rare soda to find on tap and Honey Bears has it! \n\nThanks for another tasty lunch!"
0,"I was definitely underwhelmed. It was less haut cusine and more haughty. I had the pork shoulder and my husband had a chicken ravioli dish. Both were veeery small portions. And by small I mean that my husband's dish was 11 bites total. No kidding, I counted. Both were in a broth that was well flavored. We were so hungry after 2 entrees and an appitizer that we went to another restaurant (Essen Haus) and had a second supper, that was much better and satifying. Let me preface all of this by saying that I have been in 5 star resturants in many countries, so I am not simply put off by food that is outside of the typical Americanized faire. This place is, to put it simply, too big for its britches. If you are an urban hipster and are looking for a scene, this is your place. If you are looking for some great food, you should pass on Nastrano."
0,"I stayed here last weekend with a few friends. It was for a bachelor party, we got a suite and the adjoining room in the East tower. \n-NO WIFI! None. Unless you're in the main lobby, there is zero WiFi in The Luxor. \n-Suite bedroom AC was busted making it literally too hot to sleep in. The staff changed our room which was kind of them. \n-All furniture felt it was one heavy sneeze away from breaking. \n-TV's were old and showed static-y channels. \n-Several beaten up things around the hotel: broken elevator buttons, cracked glassware, rickety elevators, stains on walls, broken door locks, etc. \n-Located on the South end of the strip. If you feels like leaving that area, it's a pain. \n-Seriously rude valet service. \n\nI have stayed at worse places, but barely. The Luxor is no longer the pinnacle it used to be, and refuses to advance like many other hotel / casinos around it. For the price you're paying, go for the Mid-North (near Treasure Island) part of the strip; same rates,  closer to popular areas, and in better shape. The only reason this didn't get a 1 star is because the main staff were very helpful and courteous."
1,If heaven was on a wood cut board it would be the bruschetta they serve here! This place feels like a modern getaway with an awesome selection of wine and who can beat 5 dollars glasses of wine everyday from 11 to 5!
0,Incredibly slow service in the mornings.  I've stood in line for 15 minutes just to order one cup of coffee when there were only 2 other people in line.  They are all very friendly but their multi-tasking abilities are extremely poor.  Not a good combination in that line of business.
0,"I understand that this place is an old classic, but it seems more old than classic at this point.  It just feels dirty inside, the food is medium quality at very best and the service struggles.  They try hard, but it looks like the staff is on their own.  Probably my last visit unless there is a serious change."
1,"Needs appointment, my first and only haircut in America in 3 years.\nGot my hair cut short and took care of the split ends. \n\nNice Korean run Place, parking is difficult"
0,"Normally if a place isn't good I wouldn't do a review but I will for Thai Taste because Im surprised at how bad it was! Ive always heard good things about this place. \n\nI ordered Chicken Pad See Ew and they gave me complimentary fried shrimp/egg roll things. I was hungry so I was ready to dive into my food but, it just wasn't good!\n\nThe chicken looked poor in quality and it had an odd smell. I couldn't help but to think of dirty mop water the whole time I attempted to eat it. On top of not being able to finish it my stomach turned and I had heartburn for the rest of the night. I will not order take out again; first & last time for me!"
1,When I get a chance to eat here the food is always great. The egg drop soup is very good. The general Tao chicken is awesome too. The sauce they use is great and chicken has nice crust on it.
1,"Decent tacos, eggs come with everything. Happy hour is great, lots of great cocktails, decent beer list, good wine list. Hoping to try actual dinner sometime here."
0,"Great place for bald guys to go. Horrible location, employees can barely speak English, and they have no talent to cut hair at all. Going to be wearing this horror show around for quite a few weeks."
0,"The outside is being painted today, specifically the drive thru, they have all of them closed.  However, it doesn't seem they staffed for this on the inside, only 3 tellers, and the line is past the table.  Should have staffed for the drive thrus not being available"
1,"THANK YOU, CAT!!!!  Me and my girl's showed up way after hours last Friday night but Cat went out of her way to fulfill a birthday request.  The gentleman still working behind the bar named Idol witnessed the whole thing.  Thank you again for making a wonderful memory!"
1,"I'm all for Oral hygiene, and CDVM helps me maintain my pearly whites every 6 months!\n\nI've lived all over North America, and this dental facility ranks highly among the others I've been to.  The dentists here, specifically Dagenais and Fox are both very professional, and very knowledgeable.  They have modern dental equipment and x-ray machines.   I came here for wisdom teeth assessment and a teeth cleaning, and both times I satisfied.  They hygienists are also very well trained.\n\nIf you are interested in getting your teeth cleaned, or have a more serious issue, these guys can handle it."
1,"This is the third time my family has been to this resturant. We live in California so we make it a point to come to the Palace Staion to eat there. The food is awesome! and the house salad omg so tastee. And the prices are so unbeliveble cheap for what you get. And the sevice FANTASTIC!!!!! our waiter was awesome, and the hostess was also polite I just wish they had a Pasta Cucina in my town!!!"
1,"Excellent food, awesome staff. I can count on Ray's again and again for a delicious meal."
1,"Came in for lunch today with my mom. Service was friendly and decor was very pleasant and inviting. My mother ordered a BLFGT, which is a BLT with a fried green tomato. I thought this was a unique concept for a sandwich and she was pleased with her food. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and it was extremely flavorful. The only disappointment was the macaroni and cheese side we both ordered. I am definitely a mac and cheese snob and my standards might be a little too demanding. I thought the flavor was lacking but I still finished every bite, so it wasn't bad. Just nothing special. I would definitely recommend this to anyone excited by southern cuisine because they do have some unique ideas and great veggie options, including a veggie pot pie and black bean burger. Will definitely come again and try something new. I am also a pickle enthusiast, and their complimentary dill pickle spear with each sandwich gives them a thumbs up in my book."
0,"If you are searching for a Condo, find a Condo.. THESE ARE APARTMENTS!!  Not condos.  The speed bumps are horrible, parking is ridiculous.  And since they are privately owned, ANYONE and I mean ANYONE can move in.  Some of the loudest and rudest people.  And to get Security to get off their lazy bums is not going to happen. Unless they happen to be out on patrol.  Its a gated community yet cars are broken into, or spray painted on.  HOA is of no help either, not to mention if you end up buying be leary.. They allow HUD!  Which brings the property value down on your home.  But alas some of us are stuck here in the POINTS recreation.  Until we can get out of the screw ball of paying mortgage too high for an APARTMENT!  Its just not worth it."
1,I love this place! It's perfect for date night and has an amazing wine list! I love the ambience and the wonderful patio. It definitely stands out from the other places in this area. I've only tried the food once and it was sort of lacking but the presentation was lovely.
0,"I was so disappointed by this place. First, the decor is pretty cool. A very laid back atmosphere with picnic table type tables in part of the restaurant. \n\nI ordered the bean and queso dip, some chicken skewers and the fried ice cream. The food was fairly flavor-less. The fried ice cream was a complete let down. The service was extremely average. Add all of these things together and I would probably swing by for a late night if I had to soak up some alcohol...but that would be it. It just was nott that good."
0,We have had dinner at many churascaria restaurants here in the Vegas area and this is by far the worst . We called ahead of time for dinner pricing and the check was  double the price we were quoted by phone for our two kids . We were not served all the meats they advertise for dinner and servings were few and far between . Our first serving of meat was 45 minutes after we arrived and they deli slice the meat paper thin . HORRIBLE !!!!! RIP OFF!!!!
1,"I came here strictly to find my CANDY MELTS so I could make some brownie pops! I found the pop sticks immediately but could't find the candy melts! I was like They HAVE to be here, SOMEWHERE! They weren't in the same aisle as the other candy making supplies but if you turned the corner, BAM! CANDY MELTS IN YO FACE! Lots of varieties so I was SET!"
1,"Good $$$ food, but tiny tiny portions. Listen to your waiter when he says you should order at least 3-4 tapas per person. We shared:\nTuna tempura: 4/5 \nAngus beef: 3/5 came out medium when we ordered medium rare, nothing special\nBrava potatoes: 4/5 creamy and spiced sauce gave it a nice kick. \nMixed paella: 3/5 seafood flavor is overwhelming! Lobster pieces are sufficient if you aren't that hungry."
0,"So....typical Denny's I guess.  This location's decor is really nice and new-looking.  I like to drop in on Denny's for their build-your-own-burger with the veggie patty since I can make a vegan burger from there.\n\nMy order was quite simple and I think there were only maybe five other tables, at most, in the entire restaurant.  Two servers were on the floor and of course the kitchen staff.  Here's where the breakdown happened.  \n\nWhat I ordered: water, veggie burger with lettuce, tomato and saut\u00e9ed onions on a whole wheat bun.  \n\nWhat I got: veggie burger with lettuce, tomato and saut\u00e9ed onions on a SESAME SEED BUN.  No water.  Just food with the wrong bun. \n\nI understand mistakes happen however, water should be the first thing to hit the table.  When the server brought the food, she realized, apologized and slowly got the water.  Make no mistake, everyone I encountered on staff was extremely nice.  When you're thirsty, nice doesn't matter much.  My glass got to less than half and still had some food left but never had an opportunity to get a refill since no one came around for long periods of time to check on me.  I had one walking-past check in: \""you alright?\"" and that was it.  I was ok at that point but at least one more stop by later I would have gotten a refill on water.\n\nI didn't have to wait long for the check, that seemed to appear quite quickly.  Anyway, I may decide to come back here just to get my guilty pleasure on but I'm bringing my own water this time, thank you very little."
0,"The food is good, but the service and atmosphere is terrible.\n\nI have been to this place a few times, and it's always slow and there's not usually a table available to sit down at.  They sell a variety of six packs and 40s to go, but beware--Boone's Farm is quite literally the top shelf.\n\nThe staff is very rude--on my last visit, they messed up my order and gave me general tso's chicken instead of tofu.  The counter lady was pretty mean to me when I asked for it to be remade.\n\nShe then proceeded to give what should have been my meal to another guy who DID order chicken (after me), but who didn't want to take it because I had ordered \""extra spicy\"" and he didn't want spicy food.  The cashier laughed at him, argued with him that even medium would be too hot for him, and in the end got him take my messed up order, reluctantly.\n\nShe then proceeded to help five more people before she had the chef make the tofu that I ordered.\n\nLike I said, the food is good, but I wouldn't go back to this place.  There are too many other Asian restaurants in Oakland where they don't make it difficult to get what you ordered!"
1,"Straight out of a Tarantino movie. I heart this place. My only problem is their ventilation sucks  so you reek of cigs when you leave, but it's a small price to pay. Their drinks seriously sneak up on you, beware..."
1,Decent price for a buffet in Vegas.  The line was not more than 30 minutes on a Thursday night.  The food was decent.  There was nothing incredibly delicious.  The server was attentive and cheerful.  \n\nGood place to get your fat kid on.  There's a suggested 2 hour limit on your feasting though.
1,"A friend and I got to go to Longhorn's pre-opening lunch before they opened this past Monday (2/24). The overall feel, look, and quality of the restaurant was generally pleasing and we were warmly greeted and seated promptly to our booth. \n\nOur waiter Tyler was a delight! And informed us on the days selections and gave us great suggestions. We started the food journey with the grilled white cheddar mushrooms. They were rich and garlicky very yummy! Then for our entree  we both selected the ribeye steaks, each was cooked perfectly medium and juicy with the perfect amount of fat.\n\nIf you're in need of a good night out ,and don't want to break the bank this longhorn is the way to go. \n\nAnd if you are lucky Tyler will be there to make the night or day even better!!"
1,"The husband and I had our first taste of karaoke here last night and I have to say, it was extremely entertaining. We didn't subject the poor people to our voices but those who chose to partake created a great atmosphere for us lurkers. Loved the fact that it was a bit of a dive, couldn't imagine a karaoke bar any other way. \n\nThe drinks were made well and my glass was never left empty. The crowd was a total mixed bag and all very friendly. We will definitely be heading back."
1,Awesome place!!!!  Even though they specialize in LS1 swaps they still do all the other work that my Escalade and My work van need to stay running on the road properly. Great service fair pricing. Love these guys!!!!!    Honest and fair with no surprise pricing when you pick up.
1,I love panera bread. Never disappointed when I come here. Quick and easy. The pick two is awesome!
0,"Horrible service. Went in to order a simple smoothie, gave out order in waited ten minutes until the one guy came back to inform me that they ran out of strawberries and peach. So I changed the order again. It's been a good twenty minutes to even get a simple smoothie. It's sad that when you hear good things about a place and your first experience wasn't what was described to you it was much worse then expected. All the employees rather sit around and talk to each other instead of getting on there own shit and want to improve the business. All I have to say is for my first time I refuse to go back. I rather go to a little shack then here."
1,"AMAZING!!  First, let me start by saying that I had the pleasure of meeting 2 of THE MOST down to earth tattoo artists ever (and I have quite a few tattoos). (RUCK & CHRIS) I was tatted by King Ruck while down in Vegas. I sent a message through the Black Spade Tattoo website, and it was smooth sailing from day one. Communication was clear, and the fact that even though Ruck was booked out months in advance, he managed to squeeze me in because I was coming in from out of town. Not only was I able to get my appointment, but the shop opens at 12, and I was able to get in at 11 AM with Ruck to get it started earlier in the day. Thank you so much for that!!\n\nThe music was amazing, the ambiance was so cool. I felt so at ease, laughing, talking, and getting tatted #Good Times. I am in LOVE with the tattoo, and I will be returning in March for more ink. \n\nTHANK YOU!!"
1,What a fantastic place to enjoy a meal. We started with the steak and chicken nachos and finished by splitting the shrimp fajitas. It was all great. And the service was top notch as well. I would not only recommend this place.  I will be back every time I'm in Vegas.
0,"Positives: the bartender was nice and they have tons of TVs. They play GREAT music. \n\nNegatives: cheese curds had little to no taste. Our server disappeared and never said a thing to us (thats how I know the bartender was nice, he ended up serving us). The Mikes Hard Lemonade that I ordered was expired and $5 (wtf, thats a little steep). The prices are way too high for the quality of food. My husband and I both got sick after eating here. \n\nI would be totally fine with my life if I never ate here again."
0,"Total sux ass! What a disappointment. \n\nWe found out that a new Indian place openning up near by and wanted to go check it out. Came once and they were closed. Came again and they were closed. But finally today we found place open. Ordered some stuff, got some boxes took them home (Its really not an eat in kinda place unless you like dinky tables and Walmart plastic chairs.) \nOhh boy! Ohh boy! Ohh wait! Rice? WTF! Its just a bowl of rice with some very little \""Stuff\"" on top of it. WOW Are those vegetables from frozen pack, cuz it sure looks like it. Tastes like it too. \nSo, i just paid 15 bux for 2 small bowls of rice with some questionable chicken and some frozen veggies that tasted like fast food Indian. \n\nDamn i feel violated."
1,"Very delicious Mexican food.  I'd give it five stars except I taste two cooks in this kitchen, one makes magic happen and the other is a novice.  So it's hit or miss  but when you hit, I'm confident it's one of the best Mexican spots in the Valley."
0,"RA sushi is so-so for sushi. It's not spectacular, but usually not terrible either. A group of us (7) came on a Saturday night and while we expected a wait for food and such because it was a weekend night, the service was much too slow. We had to remind our server to refill our drinks when they stood empty for 10+ minutes because we didn't know where our server went. A few of us ordered the same alcoholic drinks, but they were prepared differently. I don't know what was going at the bar. The food must have taken 30-45 minutes to come out. Overall, a so-so experience."
1,"The place is nice, offering the above mentioned games. It's just I feel the place is in need of a little more variety for other types of gamers. Of course, the place just opened so I'll give them that. S"
1,"The deep dish pizza here is always amazing.  I get the BBQ chicken and bacon with extra cilantro on top.....THE BEST!!!!\n\nThe service is usually sub-par but it's Vegas.  Unless you're at a high-end restaurant, you can't expect much."
1,"5 start for a hotel? yes really! I've come here for work once, and for pleasure a second time. In all I've spent maybe $300 gambling. Sure, the rooms have always been nice, but I'm no high roller. That being said, since I stayed here and joined the players club, I've been innundated with special offers for the Mirage. I finally took one of them. (book 5 months out, come mid week, and you get a suite.) Holy cow, they weren't kidding. I have a massive one bedroom suite overlooking the strip. Wet bar, 3 tv's. Really swanky.\n\nHigh end room, or low end room - the mirage is a great value for the dollar, and they'll be happy to take care of you."
1,"We have eaten here twice--both times the food and service was excellent.  The first time, Jason, was also training a new person.  He, and she, were professional and efficient.  My husband had a question about how the prime rib was cooked--He like his well-done.  Jason went into the kitchen and the chef/owner came out with a piece of it to that Ken could try it before ordering--good customer service.  I had the crab benedict and the crab cake was as good as Ruby Tuesday's.  The second time I had the Reuben--the best one I have had.  My husband had the ham steak and eggs over easy.  Perfection.  \n\nIt's hard to believe that the 3 previous reviews and I had frequented the same place."
1,"I think this place was pretty good.  I'm an east coaster.  I usually cook my own shellfish when I get a craving for it but this time I felt like getting some in public.  The patio is smoking which for us smokers is a rare treat.  They had poker going on that night.  They basically took up the entire patio but they seemed like wonderful people (I love to play free Texas Hold Em but the wife was with me) they were polite and having fun.\n\nThe service was EXCELLENT.  Two bartenders on that night.  They seemed incredibly busy with the poker people but they always came and checked on us.  Never once did we feel ignored.  To be honest, it was the best service I've had in quite some time.  Extra bonus points seeing they running around for the poker people.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  I had crab cakes and they were AMAZING.  My wife had the talipa and it was tasty.  \n\nOverall, this is my kind of place and I would come here again.  If time allows it, I'd love to come back to play poker."
1,"Nice place to stay, good price for. CDL and AAA 49.99  A NIGHT"
1,"I'm a huge fan of Mon Ami Gabi - great food, great view, excellent prices.  Delicious doesn't have to break the bank.  The french onion soup is excellent, as is the escargot.  I always get the steak frites - thin cut of steak, cooked to perfection (often, you find the thinner cuts of steak come out well done, but not here; medium rare, as requested).  You won't be disappointed with a meal here, give it a shot."
1,"21 Dec 2013\n\nThis was my first time going there, and I took my girlfriend around 4:30pm on a Saturday. It was already packed, so I had a good feeling! We got seated immediately since it was just the two of us. We looked at the menu and was surprised to see that they had half off selected sushi for 1/3 of the menu--maybe more.\n\nWe ordered a salmon nigiri and seared white tuna nigiri. Hands down these were the best in the area. We also got the Gordon Gecko, Eating Nemo and Chuck Norris rolls. Eating Nemo was a glorified california roll--I wouldn't get it a second time. Gordon Gecko was okay. Chuck Norris tasted like a Doritos. Even though we didn't really like the rolls, all of the fish served was fresh!"
1,"I had the Hot Yogi(Pinapple, Wheatgrass, Lemon and coconut water). The place is nice and big, plenty of seating. Friendly staff."
1,"This was the best service I have ever had. Best sushi ever also. The server was knowledgeable and very friendly. I drove here from the strip because the reviews were so good, they didn't disappoint. The green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was delicious and I don't like green tea all that much. I have never seen 5 stars on yelp but they definitely deserve all of them. When I visit Vegas again I will be back. Great job!"
0,"First off, I LOVE Pita Jungle food and experience.  This location continues to slide in quality and service, however, to the point it's now on the \""no-go\"" list.  :(\n\nWe went in about 3 months ago, and the service was dismissive and curt.  The food was lacking in the normally consistent high quality.  But, we took it as a bad day, and went back yesterday.  Again, we love the food.  :)\n\nHowever, this day confirms the place is off the mark entirely.  We ordered the appetizer platter...food was good, however, the pita's were clearly microwaved, and therefore, got hard as a rock before you could finish it.  Fresh is no longer the rule here, apparently.  :(\n\nWe both had gyros, which were also lacking.  The meat was super salty - and BF agreed, which says a lot, since he favors food that is well-seasoned and isn't as salt-sensitive as I am.  My pita was also going stale by the time I was at the end of the wrap.\n\nLastly, the server totally mischarged my credit card.  She undercharged us $15 on a $30 lunch, and because I am honest to a fault, I brought it to her attention.  No apology, no great thanks, either.  She went off to recharge the card, muttering something about how she wanted to see what she did wrong.  I told her to just charge the card the remaining amount.  Instead, she brought me back a new slip for the actual total.  I asked her for the cancellation on the original slip, and she said it wasn't required.  Not sure why I have this niggling feeling I was double-charged.  \n\nRegardless, overall, a lousy experience,  We'll stick with the PJ at Fashion Square."
0,This place has gone to shits !! The food sucks and the service is horrible ! It used to be good but now it's the worse.. Don't go coz the food is not good n dry n disgusting.. Sorry to say
1,"Phoenix needs Mary Coyle and Sugar Bowl because, if anything, they serve as a tasty time capsule to another time.  It also helps that Mary makes the best raspberry shakes this side of Bear Lake, Utah."
0,"Really austere, creepy interior. It's all white and chrome and too OPEN - gives me a weird vibe. The girl working there was really nice and came right out from behind the counter to offer us samples of flavours. BUT they had hardly any flavour choices I'd want (coconut, pistachio, hazelnut, pomegranate all sound gross). I went with typical salted caramel and vanilla. They had a lot of different toppings I haven't seen at the other yogurt places I've tried (like whole Hostess Zingers and donuts?!) but a lot of the bars weren't chunked up so you couldn't really mix them into the yogurt, just kind of add it to your lot. Overall, another typical yogurt place that's trying to be a little too high-class for what it is."
1,"I ran into this place on accident, and it was a great surprise! The employees there really helped me out, explained the layout of the store, explained who they were as a bookstore, and he even invited me to some events; and I only just walked into the place! Their customer service is amazing!  Their books are just as much in price as Barnes and Nobles, except you are supporting a local business (whoo hoo!).  They have a small corner with comfy chairs to read a few chapter before buying, and they have a quaint little section for children with classic books (my favorite, The Real Story of the Three Little Pigs).  In the very back left is a pretty large section of discounted books ($1-10 bucks).  The whole store is a 'mystery' theme but they have best sellers, such as The Help, too."
0,"never again !! Sat. morning took my daughter to breakfast there. she had 2 breakfast burritos &.a hash brown. We sat down inside\nthe second burrito had a bug on it the kind with the pincher at the end so I took it to the cashier asked for the manager I show it to him with a confused look. he then showed it to i'm assuming she was the owner plain clothes behind the counter Asian lady. listen to this excuse it blew my mind she said that it must have flown on the burrito I told her there is no wings,then she says it can't be from us because everything is brought in frozen and if it was from them the bug would be dead! Really!"
1,"My friends and I hit up the Gelato Spot on my recent visit to Scottsdale and what a perfect way to end the day!\n\nI was waffling between one and two flavors (one being small and two being two scoops/medium) and I finally chose medium because I couldn't pick just one flavor! Calories be damned! I really enjoyed my Toasted Almond and Coconut. YUM. It came with a long cookie which was a nice touch. \n\nYou've gotta know what you want when you get up there. Those ladies like to keep the line moving! They'll let you taste flavors, but they'll help the next person in line while you're deciding."
1,"Great new location!  Great lighting and well appointed. You can tell they $pent some money on this move.\n\nHave nothing but kind words to say about the service and the selection.\nIt really is one of the nicest, best stocked purveyors of firearms in the valley.\nEven though I tend to ask a lot of stupid questions, they were patient and thoughtful in their replies.  For those not familiar with guns this is a really comfortable place.  If you are a collector or are well versed it's a great place simply because they have so much to look at.  Also, they had ammo.  That was odd now days and a welcome sight.  Also, the prices were very competitive.  I highly recommend giving them a try."
0,"The latte is good (trust me, almost any coffee would be good after a night out in vegas and early morning conference wake up call), but the lines here are ridiculous since it's right next to the conference area. Save yourself some time and go to the Starbucks outside. It'll be faster (even though it looks farther)."
0,Very cheap and smokey.  We only stayed for a few minutes
1,"WOW! All I can say is that this was one of the sexiest shows my wife and I have seen. Now there is \""slutty\"" and there is \""sultry\"". Zumanity is definitely the latter without being too \""out there\"" for the vanilla types, and just enough spice for those who enjoy a more outrageous lifestyle. \n\nI knew the show was amazing when one of the performers, reclined on a couch just above the concession stand gave me a beautiful, lustful, sultry \""come hither\"" stare and I felt the \""butterflies\"" in my stomach. The rest of the show was just as amazing. \n\nHighly recommended for loving couples who enjoy mature, yet seductive entertainment. Leave the kids at home for this one..."
1,"Best deal in Gilbert. They have a deal on the weekdays where you can get 2 full meals for $13.99.  You have a choice of many entrees and side. Its not Outback but its still really good. The rolls are awesome. The service is good.  Free peanuts. Ever since this has been open I havent been back to Texas Roadhouse. Logans is half the price and almost as good. If you are looking for a good dinner for a great deal, check out logans."
1,"This business recently opened in place of a Quick n Clean wash (which has been closed for awhile). This is a type of wash where you drive through yourself.  They gutted the inside and replaced with all new machines, this is not a touch free car wash. Offers the typical options and versions of a car wash, Basic, middle ground that cleans rims/wheels and high end with wax and tire shine. It offers free vacuums and air hose/nozzles to squirt out the water from cracks. I have to say the shaded parking offers plenty of space so you can open up your doors and dry your car  with no issues. It also has a sink to rinse out or wet your rags with. Overall a good place for those that like to do most of the car wash stuff themselves. Also you don't have to put up with car wash up sells and it offers unlimited plans as well. They are offering free car washes as part of their grand opening.\n\nPositive:\nWashes car really well\nPlenty of space to park and dry/vacuum your car\nAir Hoses to blow out crevasses\nGood location\nEverybody is friendly so far :-)\n\nNeutral:\nDon't have a pre-bug soak station (attendant said they will put one in shortly).\nAir dryers do a decent job but definitely need to dry car after (this is the  case with most of these type of washes) but it has more dryers then others i have used. Spot free rinse seems to do ok.\n\nSlight negatives:\nVacuums are on one side of the car so have to pass the hose through the car to get both sides\nAir hoses are a bit short \nSo far deosn't offer a free wet towel to wipe down inside of car"
1,Class act...hardly ever behind schedule. The best $9800 I've spent. My son's teeth are perfect!
1,Had the Adobada and Shrimp tacos..both were DELISH!...and the people working there are very nice.
1,So me and my brother came here a few weeks ago and it's such a cute place! Cailey the bartender was our server and she was so dang cute and bubbly and I absolutely love that in a server. She gave us great service and we were very happy with her. She had great suggestions for the drinks as well and she whipped up two different martins for my brother. A red velvet cake one and I don't quite remember what the other was. The food was pretty good. Not outstanding but I'm still overall happy with the experience. Thanks Cailey!
1,"Our endless search for new lunch options around my workplace had us glaring over towards Pasta China on one of our many boring trips to the  Chipotle/Five Guys/Subway courtyard spot at Craig and Nellis. Im pleased we ventured over one day because this place is unique and definitely worth a shot. The fusion is all over the place and everything Ive ever had was quite good. The overall value is outstanding as the highest priced entree is $7. There are a few asian inspired pasta dishes and some primarily asian dishes with italian ingredients thrown in. I wouldn't call the food outstanding, rather very good and very generous portions too. There are a few very good vegetable based dishes that are pretty healthy and some real trainwreck of lovliness alfredo type stuff too. One of the tastiest things ever is a \""Firecracker\"" roll- a regular eggroll wrapper, filled with chicken, jalapenos and some cream cheam type mixture and deep fried to delish perfection....I call it the worlds greatest jalapeno popper. It costs $1.50 hahaha- great value here. One warning- we've come in with large groups(eight or more) which slowed the service WAAAY down and also stressed the staff out to where we could hear some browbeating and yelling behind the counter-reminded me of the corporate management training scene from Gung- Ho. Anyay, try this place. It different and very inexpensive and most impotantly, interesting."
1,"I am surprised by the bad reviews of this gym. No, it's not the biggest/trendiest place in Las Vegas but that's not why I would choose a gym so maybe I just don't get it. Actually, I kind of don't want to post a great review because I that it is not overly crowded...but I will be selfless and not keep it to myself.\n\n I have been going here since November '10 and I love it! The cardio room isn't huge but I've never had to wait for a treadmill or elliptical and I have gone during different times of the day.\n\nI take my one year old to the daycare and the staff is awesome with her. She has some separation anxiety but they are always encouraging and caring (to both of us, haha) regardless of how fussy she is on a particular day. Lately she has gotten more used to it and has started having fun while being there, which is great!\n\nThe group classes are my favorite part of the gym. There are so many classes to choose from and are at different times throughout the day. The instructors are high-energy and so wonderful. Hands-down the best instructors of any gym I have even gone to. You have to try Body Burn, Spinning, and Step. \n\nI can't comment on the indoor pool because I have never used it but know people that use it all the time and are happy with it.\n\nThe outdoor pool is nice with slides and a large kiddie pool.\n\nLove this YMCA!"
0,So sorry to report I hade such high expectations and was so disappointed ! Packets of mayonnaise??. Restaurants in Scottsdale do better than that! Food quality did not even compare to anything in Hawaii who are your food vendors?\n\nWent back tonight and had the fish tacos (because i had a gift card to use up) wow  they were amazing!!!! I would so go back and have the fish tacos anytime!
1,"A GREAT place to check out if you're here in town, or are looking for a few fun things to do while on a visit. If you have the money to spend the expensive package is almost worth the warmer coat and the photo, if not, make sure you dress like you're going to play in the snow (ok, maybe a little less). I don't remember how much we paid for drinks but if I recall correctly it wasn't horrible. I believe beers were around $4 (which isn't bad on the strip). The two bartenders that were there were surprisingly quick for the crowd that was around.\nOnce again, absolutely check the place out! (and then maybe write a review about your good time on yelp!)."
1,"OMG so good!! i was in vegas for two days and I had this twice AND i bought a couple to fly home with me!\n \nLoved their tuna melt, the prices were cheap and the bread is AH-MAZING! they need to open a branch over here in LA!"
0,I have been going to RZ Salon for a decade. I pay the high prices because when Amy wants to she can really give a great cut. IT IS hit or miss though. I often feel I should apologize to Amy for just being there. Today I could not take her attitude any more. I felt talking to her briefly about how to cut my hair was impossible. She was rude and dismissed  me. She started cutting my hair though we were at odds with what she was going to do. I had to leave. If you want to pay $70 for a haircut I'd suggest going someplace that will be nice too. Amy's shampoo is nothing special either.
0,"I went to Salt of the Earth with some colleagues without having ever really heard anything particular about the place. The general decor was nice and the service staff was friendly and professional. \n\nThe backless benches on the first floor, while suitable in a setting like a night-market in Taiwan, were not a good idea for a restaurant that functions at a more leisurely pace. So if you want to take your time and enjoy your meal, ask for the second floor where they have normal seating options.\n\nThe menu is seasonal, so your experience with the victuals at Salt of the Earth may be very different. But my duck was bland, dry and overcooked. I had the impression that it was intended as a gateway introduction to waterfowl for people who have never enjoyed anything beyond beef burgers, steak and chicken nuggets. The portions were also puny and there were no side dishes (e.g. salads/soup) or bread. While no one in my party would describe the food as being bad, no one thought the food was remarkable and frankly should not command the menu prices. \n\nMy experience was that Salt of the Earth was a pompous restaurant that seeks to convince you that it is \""fancy\"" by its decor and elevated prices instead of impressing you with its food."
1,Excellent and fresh.  Going back for more.
1,Tried the PBJ Burger on a recommendation from our server and wow. It was amazing I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale next time. Also the sweet potato tots are great as well as their onion rings. I was impressed to see a lot of the locals there as well as visitors like myself. Great burgers and cold beer.
0,"Food is great but service, not so good. Left my debit card which the server promptly turned in but when I called 3 hours later, the hostess quickly advised no cards had been left at lunchtime. It took my driving to the East Blvd location to have the bartender check the cash drawer to locate the card AND remember the server turning it over to her at lunchtime. Cost me a lot of time and agony!"
1,"This place is awesome. I decided to redo my living room and bought a microfiber sofa sectional that came with a matching ottoman. This is the way to go. You can lay out on it while watching movies. So much better than putting your feet up on a coffee table. And it was only $1k. Saw this style for twice as much everywhere else. It did take about 6 weeks for delivery, but this was a quality sectional at a great price and delivery was free so it was well worth the wait. \n\nI also purchased a plasma TV and a TV stand. The stand was a great quality cherry console with 2 drawers and 2 cabinets on each side with glass fronts. This was a heavy duty sturdy piece for only $350. The only thing I had to assemble was putting in the glass shelves in the cabinets. Although I love Target I've seen stuff there for almost as much and some pieces that were even $100 more that still required assembly and were of so-so quality. This was a great deal. This item did not include delivery and was picked up at the store. \n\nThey have great quality furniture and electronics for a great price. Lots of stuff here. Living room sets, bedroom furniture and bedding sets, prints, electronics, dining tables, patio furniture, and all kinds of other stuff to decorate your home. \n\nI plan on coming back here once I am ready to purchase a new bedroom set."
0,"Had the food delivered, 2 stars for promptness, but yuck on the food!"
0,"IF you have a choice, choose another rental car company in Vegas.  THIS IS A FRANCHISE AND YOU WILL GET NO ASSISTANCE FROM BUDGET IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS LOCATION.  I am waiting for someone, anyone to answer the phone.  I've been on hold for over 30 minutes right now.  Any car company can get you in a car and charge your credit card for the service.  IF you have problems with the reservation or the rental car, YOU WILL GET NO ASSISTANCE from the location.  Caveat Emptor!"
1,"Joan H\n\nIf you have ever hesitated to go to the dentist, put your fears aside. This practice is amazing. Competent , caring staff. Dr. Parsanko really listens to his patients and addresses their concerns. He always tells you what he is going to do so there are no surprises and always checks to make sure you are comfortable. My only regret is not finding this fantastic practice sooner."
1,"Mountain Gate/Trails is awesome!!  I really enjoyed living there and the only reason I'm not still there is because I bought a house.\n\nRegarding the name, apparently, there are two sides to the complex.  The Gate side & the Trails side.  Ask the complex the difference, I couldn't see one.\n\nSo to the basics....they have a beautiful property that IS dog friendly.  Two fitness centers, two pool complexes that include cabanas and BBQs, TWO business centers with complimentary FAX & internet use.  There is a lovely little trail just behind the property great for walking the pups and meeting peeps & dog-poo bags all through the property.  Although there is not a gated or patch of grass designated for animals, so as long as you're cool with going for a walk on a pretty trail, then you'll enjoy this pet experience. \n\nThe staff was always incredibly friendly!!!  The maintenance crew was great too!!  They have an online maintenance submission where if you have issues or need assistance with something in your apartment you can submit a request online and they get back to you promptly.  Paying rent is a breeze too, with their online payment system.\n\nGarages are optional and do come with an additional fee. They're VERY small, one car.  So if you're a crappy driver, I don't suggest gettting one, you'll probably bang your car up just trying to get in.\n\nAll the apartments are fully equiptped with a stacked washer/dryer combo, GE appliances, walk-in closets and oversized garden tubs (not to be confused with jacuzzi tubs, there are no jets in these ones).\n\nI NEVER once, no joke, heard my neighbors.  EXCEPT when someone was walking down the hall, that's it.  So no apartment noise.  They also give you the option to choose from several paint colors, for an additional fee of course.  They're newer and very nice, HOWEVER, as I moved out, they were running a lot of new tenant specials and it appeared to be attracting interesting folks.  Which is not bad, but I did notice a lot more trash being left around.  Whatever, I'm oober picky.  \nBut rent is negotiable, I weaseled my way into a much lower monthly rent.  So try it, don't be shy!\n\nDo take a gander on their website to see the different floor plans, pictures and other amenities. :)  Good luck!  It has my stamp of approval."
0,"McCarran Intl Airport has become a cluster--too crowded, always 'renovating' but that's really code for more slot machines and less food options. Glad my plane wasn't more than 15 minutes late or I would have starved to death...or lost my mortgage payment hoping for one more spin on Wheel of Fortune. Great people watching but no compliment to the Vegas clientele."
0,"Stayed at the NY NY Hotel/Casino - 111 F outside.\nWe were NOT going out for dinner! Ended up in the\n\""Village\"" downstairs - saw a gaggle of mediocre \nrestaurants, wandered into Gonzalez Y Gonzalez.\n\nBoo. \n\nFOOD: Ordered 2 steak nachos, a plate of boneless/\nskinless chicken and a bean and cheese burrito. \n\nSteak Nachos were TEENY TINY!!! We had literally 10\nchips each with beans, cheese, 2 small strips of steak\nand a jalepeno pepper baked on top. They were placed\naround in a circle - fancy like. To their credit, the meat was\nvery tasty but damn... come on... give me more than 10 \nchips for $12. I was expecting a plate of nachos. Plural.\n\nBean & Cheese burrito was also small. Taco Bell makes\nbigger burritos. No bullshit. $5 for that.\n\nThe chips and salsa are endless. Verde salsa was decent.\nWait, our chip basket had a handful of unbroken chips and\nthen the rest of the basket was FULL of chip pieces. WTF?\n\nWhatever. The waiter came by and asked, \""Everthing ok? \nCan I get you anything else?\""\n\nWe lol'd.\n\nSERVICE: Slow. TVs all showed the same lame golf channel.\n\nPRICES: Fair. For Vegas. I guess. $48 for 4 of us.\n**soft drinks are not bottomless.**\n**cocktails are weak**\n\n2 Stars for the 20 nacho chips we had to share between us"
1,"I was a Sunday walk in for a nose piercing.  I was greeted in what I thought to be a reasonable amount of time... I was given paperwork to fill out, and was waiting for the artist to become available.  I was provided with post care instructions that were very clear and concise.\nOnce I was with the 'piercer' he was very personable, and asked if I had any questions, marked my nose, and went for it. \nAlthough I have wanted a nose piercing for years, I hadn't done much research... blow your nose millions of times prior to going in.... be prepared for a betadine cotton swab to be shoved up and wiggled around your nose.  The piercing didn't hurt too badly, but threading of the ring wasn't too pleasant.\nYou are provided a bottle of betadine to clean your ring.\nOver all, I am happy :-)\n\nIf you're looking for a tattoo, make an appointment, esp for a Sunday."
1,"Great place to watch a game. I've been here several times when I'm back in town (lived here for 6 years) and never been disappointed. Tons of TV, great service and happy hour specials until 7pm during the week.\n\n66 cent boneless wings on thursday. Worth it even though I live traditional better. I think that's Tuesday nights."
1,"I tried out this place for lunch yesterday and after ambitiously deciding to walk there and back, it was very rewarding. The owner/manager recognized me even though I was sporting my sweaty-overworked look that afternoon.\n\nBecause of my famished and starry state of mind, I didn't analyze the menu or the diggs, I got my vegetarian bowl and dipped out.. Tisk Tisk, I know. \n\nThe vegetarian comes with guacamole so I have no price complaints. They offer brown rice, which makes them stand apart in my mind from the other Southwestern burrito chains. Everything look really fresh and well-stocked, that includes the staff... I believe my compostable to-go bowl passed through a total of six pairs hands. Honestly, 12 hands. Now that's service!\n\nMy total was $5, with a coupon which wasn't hard to come by. And yes, their interior designer also chose to go with the industrial tin-can theme, but they do have an outdoor patio with umbrellas!"
0,"Worst experience ever! Just how long does it take to cook 2 burgers? We ordered 2 burgers, very simple burgers and after more than 30 minutes waiting, the server came to us saying \""your food is coming!\"" After 15 more minutes, we decided to leave. I am honest and I wanted to pay for the 2 beers... 10 minutes to get the change! The server came to me \""Why didn't you wait 5 more minutes? Your food was ready...\"" Yeah right. The manager? Obviously more preoccupied to make the pretty servers laugh... Pathetic and unprofessional."
1,I was in the Green Vally area for lunch and wanted sashimi. I yelped sushi and       Sushi Imagine was the closest and highly rated. This was my first time here.\n  They don't have a sashimi lunch special(which they should) so my waitress suggested I order the sashimi dinner(16.95) as I wanted salad and rice also.\n  It was all very good and with generous portions. Service was great and it seems to\nbe a family run business with many regular customers.\nI was happy and will return.
0,"Dirtiest Tablecloths in Phoenix area: At first the atmosphere is appealing, once you manage to get inside the non-broken door (are they EVER going to fix it?). The tablecloths at this place are simply disgusting. Plenty of stains, from overusage in the past and also sometimes fresh ones from the previous diners. Employees often have food stains on their white shirts, which I can't understand either. Overall, very dirty place.\n\nI managed to give the food a try anyway (don't ask why). Overall, very average for Indian Cuisine. The Naans were rather uninspiring, so stick to the paratha or poori. Vegetable Pakora is dry and chalky. Mint chutney is watery. To top it off, several of the menu items aren't available but they haven't changed the menu. They used to have a southern Indian chef who would make dosa. No more."
0,I wish I didn't have to give it a star but I do. I'm not sure where I should begin. First off I was there for our ball. I didn't want to have to pay the $200 for the night at the Rio where our ball was being held so I stayed here. Worst mistake! I got the room for $50 but after fees it went up to $90. Still not a bad price for Vegas. As we were walking to our room we had made it to our hallway and I just have to say that is stunk really bad. The hallway had a completely different smell then the casino. When we got into our room it was of decent size. The room had an odd smell but I sprayed my perfume to take away the smell. The bed was comfy so I can't really complain. A few days later I was checking my account and seen that I was charged $186.36 for the room! There were so many hidden fees that they don't tell you about. The pool was closed so there shouldn't even be a resort fee. I'm looking in taking them to court.
1,"We hadn't  been to Arizona in years, so we were initially itching for Mexican food, but Blue Adobe turned out to be relatively near where we were staying and had some great reviews on Yelp, so we went. It was absolutely fantastic. However, it's not for everyone. We did not find it to be especially hot-spicy, but chili powder is in a lot. The salsa that comes with the chips is rich, thick and flavorful, but if you really, really like the tomato-centric salsa of the typical Mexican or Tex-Mex place, you might not like this dark, smoky salsa. I had a special, halibut rubbed in ancho chile spices with a shrimp enchilada. The fish was dry -- a big hazard for fish -- but good. The enchilada was out of this world. The rice was very good, though I hit a lumpy pocket of spice that hadn't dispersed in the pot. There was so much on the menu we would want to try, if we stayed in the Mesa area for a week we could come in every night and keep trying different things."
1,"Outstanding oysters on the half shell. Italian themed seafood dishes. A little on the pricey side,but excellent service, food and presentation"
1,"BEST Reuben sandwich and roast beef sandwich I've ever had, and I'm from NY! Would have loved to try a root beer or cream, or egg soda, but I was too full! Great place, very nice owners and staff!"
1,"On a fairly recent trip to New York, I opted to try out Lombardi's instead of Grimaldi's. And while I can't comment on whether the Las Vegas location is exactly the same as the one in New York, from what I can tell, I think Grimaldi's is much better than Lombardi's.\n\nNow I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl. Not that I hate thin crust, but I do not prefer it. Grimaldi's was still excellent in my eyes, and I would definitely come back given the option on a future Vegas trip. I really enjoyed the sausage as a topping, but I would stay away from the bacon, as it's a bit too salty. \n\nKeep in mind when you come here that this is New York style pizza. It's thin crust, it's simple. I'm thinking that maybe some of the negative reviews here are grounded on unmatched expectations due to unfair or unrealistic standards. \n\nFour girls split a large pizza and a large salad. Just the right amount of food.\n\nOh, keep in mind, if you want to do half-half on your pizza and have a certain topping on only half of your pizza, they will still charge you as if you had that topping on your ENTIRE pizza. In other words, if mushrooms cost \""X\"" amount of dollars as a topping for your whole pizza, they will still charge you \""X\"" amount of dollars to get mushrooms on only half your pizza. Kinda lame.\n\nInside decor was nice as well, with New York subway pictures and signs.\n\nLocated up on the second floor in the Grand Canal Shoppes! You might have to ask around for directions, since it wasn't on the maps yet when I was there."
0,"FYI: Will not accept restaraunt.com coupons.  Printed off the coupon and headed out for the 30 min drive to check this place out  and there was a big sign on the door that said we do not accept restarunt.com coupons., then why are you offering a coupon on there?   We all kinda had a bad taste for this place after we saw the sign and went to switch instead."
1,"So delicious! I've been twice now. Once with a couple of moms and our babies/toddlers. It was kid friendly - they have a few kid's options (which my picky eater ate happily) & a changing table. A note though, they only have 2 high chairs. This doesn't make the place better or worse - I just found it to be helpful info since I was with kids. I liked it so much I took my mom for mother's day. She loved it too, which isn't an easy feat. ;) I've had the build your own omlette, the french toast, a mocha & french macaroons. EVERYTHING was yummy. It's 4 instead of 5 because of the service. The girls were nice, but not super with it. ;) (i know that's mean, sorry, it's just true)"
1,"Definitely a fan of this unmarked, unpretentious downtown dive.  Exceptional menu and carefully crafted creations... my favorites?  Devil's Eggs w/ Caviar & Pancetta, CRISPY chicken skin and BACON JAM.  Amazing service and menu.  Hi-5 to this concept... can't wait till the balcony is open.  I'll be seeing you Carson."
1,"bigger that i thought it would be. plus you don't have to walk into a shopping center or casino/hotel to get to right off the strip. filled with things that people actually buy not like some of the other shops right off the strip that have tons of things that maybe once in a while someone buys. no dust collecting, clean and filled with Hawaii and Vegas souvenirs, candies, t-shirts, calendars, macadamia nut snacks, enjoy cold drinks and a break from walking the strip, etc."
1,"I loved the food here!  The sushi was very fresh. We had the 300, happy ending and another one with veggies that was just wonderful.  Also...had the peanut butter mochi for dessert.  Never had PB mochi before and it was really really good! I will definitely be back to this place! My only complaint was that the service was a little on the slow side, but other than that it was great!"
0,"Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns.  Hard to beat that.\n\nThis location suffers from one major flaw - that it is located alongside a busy road in the parking lot of a Home Depot.  So, this means there are tons of... let's say... loiterers.  When a patrol car occasionally makes a round through here, the loiterers all scramble into Del Taco or run in various directions.  They also stare at your car in the parking lot if it happens to be nice.\n\nSo, drive your beater if you eat here, and don't eat here if you're bothered by a lot of loiterers outside."
0,"Been out to Joe's Farm Grill twice.. and both times Ive been SO excited about going there and both times I have left well, disappointed. \n\nThis place is another restaurant from the Joe's Real BBQ gang (delish). The place is actually very cool.. you can eat out under the stars if the wind is in the right direction (there are horses close by) and they have a machine that dispenses as much ranch dressing as you can use! Gotta love that! But the food has been underwhelming and on the verge of boring. Ive tried the burgers, grilled pizzas and salads. For me they are not much better then what you could get at your local mall food court. I know it's crazy for me to say that but considering that much of what they serve is organic I just dont feel or taste a difference here. \n\nThe saving grace here is the coffee shop next door called, you got it.. Coffee Shop. They have lot of YUM-E desserts and make a some great coffee drinks. Oh get this, they hand pack there espresso machine.. no click click turbo-spresso machines here. I like the way that sounds.. I think I will steal that from myself! \n\nSide note.. this place is in the middle of nowhere becoming somewhere.. bring a map!"
1,"I went for happy hour in the bar and it was great! It was so busy, but the server was able to still be really nice and get us everything we needed. We had the chicken egg rolls on the happy hour and they were so good! We also got the banana cream pie, it was so amazing! It melted in your mouth! I cannot wait to go back!"
1,Amazing customer service and great food! The first time I went here the guy taking orders made recommendations and walked me through the items. All the employees are courteous and friendly. And the food is delicious!
0,"I would give two thumbs for bad customer service.\nI would give them award for having most horrible customer service!\n\nI doubt if 24 fitness or gold gym can even compare with their rudeness...

At least they could apologize for messing up my membership with someone else's account instead of being rude and make me wait on counter for an hour so I can finally get into the gym!\n\nAnd manager..... Wow this bid dude with bold head was really awesome in doing horrible customer service. King of king!\n\nHe sat down his nice chair....crossing his arm around him n looks up on me (did not offer any sits)  And saying there is nothing he can do\nIf I want to complain about the situation  just call the corporation with sneer :) on his face.\n\nWell, at that moment I was hoping if there is any natural disaster in vegas ...attack their office first and took the bold manager n this black dude with Hispanic woman with red shirt away.

0,I am in smiths several times a week and one never knows who the mgr.is there have been several.i buy a lot of bread and their so called fresh bread is always so hard that a duck would break his bill on.i told a mgr how hard the rolls were and he got angry with me saying our rolls are baked fresh every morning. I think their attitude comes from the fact that this is a poorer part of town and they don't want to impress or help the people with not much money. This mgr.even walked away without even trying to help me find a fresh roll.  How's that for customer service.???.
0,"And the award for the saltiest chicken curry on the planet goes to...\n\nNo, really. I must have had a bag of salt in that chicken curry with my $5.75 lunch special. The one that strangely comes with sweet and sour chicken, rice, and egg drop soup.  Honestly, the quality wasn't terrible - but seriously. Salt city. Maybe it's MSG. Who knows! However, service was very quick. Food was out in no time. For the price, it isn't bad I suppose. Certainly wouldn't be my choice unless it was my only one. It's also fun to say you ate at Jacky Chan's."
1,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments. \n\nBarry Manilow's new gig at the Paris Las Vegas is absolutely worthwhile.

0,"Tried to book my wedding there but spent literally hours on hold and being transferred to various departments. Eventually stayed there, but booked the wedding elsewhere after no one got back to me. Even when calling as a guest, the phones appeared to be unattended. Nice facility but I have never experienced such a total lack of responsiveness at any other hotel. Hospitality should be the first priority in this industry and the grandness of this particular place is completely wasted on such surprisingly bad service."
0,This place used to be much more classy and tons more fun. Will try again maybe on another night.
0,"So I've come here multiple times. I think the only reason I come here is for the Horchata drink to be honest because it's made by a machine (not them). They take FOOOREEEVVVERRRR to get my food. This is supposed to be fast food. Quick! I'm not in a full service restaurant that I have to wait 20 minutes for my food. The place in the kitchen is a dump. I know since they leave the door open on my way to the restrooms (which you should stay away from). Chemicals next to prep table (near food!!!)  NO BUENO!  Meat was sitting out in the back. I'm not sure how long that was there. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n They have terrible, terrible service. It is always a girl with no uniform wearing regular unprofessional clothing . I'm not judgmental, but she has bracelets and rings on. When you work in food service, you are NOT allowed to have jewelry anywhere near your hands. She could pass on germs and bacteria from the jewelry onto the food. Ok fine. But when someone touches their face and hair and then goes back in the kitchen without washing her hands? I kind of shutter. I've worked in restaurants for so long, that it's just hard for me to NOT notice bad hygienic practices even if to the average person, seems pretty picky. Hey, at least i know the Maricopa County Food Code!\n\nShe always takes my order like, \""Ugh, I can't text and I have to take your order????\"" \n\nI once ordered tacos and it was filled with guacamole. Don't get me wrong I love guacamole, but when I order carne asada tacos, I want to taste the meat, too! So I told the girl, excuse me but...these are waaay overpowered by guacamole. She says \""sorry, I cant make you new ones.\"" WHAT? Seriously? You served me bad food, and I came here for a decent meal. She said, \""do you want me to pick off the avocado? Well, actually, you can do it yourself?\""  Well.Okaaaaay? Thanks....I'll eat disappointed. I don't know why I deal with terrible places that don't care about the customer. I think it's just become it's the norm with fast food. Anyway, it's not really worth coming here."
0,"DISCRIMINATION AT PIO PIO.\n\nPIO PIO WAITER BANNED ME, MY PREGNANT WIFE AND 3 KIDS FROM THE  RESTAURANT FOR ASKING THEM TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE TO US.\n\nI really like the food here but the service is the absolute worst.  The waiters definitely tend to the non-minority patrons before the minority customers and treat them better.  Guess what I am? Yep, you guessed it,  a minority. \n\nOn one trip to Pio Pio, the really skinny, delicate looking guy/girl (I'm not sure) waiter with the overly plucked eyebrows forgot 2 of my kids's kids meals.  Maybe it was because we ordered so many dishes that they got confused and it just got lost in the shuffle.  Good thing we ordered so much because my kids ate plenty and their dishes were not missed but we kept looking out for their meals to arrive during the entire meal.  We figured they never placed the order but when we received the check we were billed for it.  I had them remove the charge but they had this look on their faces like we ate the meal and were trying to get a freebie (2 kid meals for $4 bucks each or so). I let it slide and left a full 20 % tip because we still had a great meal and lots of fun.\n\nOn subsequent visits the service was typically and terribly slow but on my last visit I was forced to let them know how unacceptable their service towards us was.  \n\nWe sat outside, which was a big mistake because since we were not in their immediate line of sight and vicinity, they seemed to have lost track of us.  They were painfully slow to take our orders, serve our drinks, bring out our food, and fill our waters.  We ordered an additional rice and beans side dish during the course of the meal and waited 30 minutes for it to arrive when we were already done with the meal.  We asked for more water and the head waiter/head bus boy/manager agreed.  15 minutes later he passed by to tend to the table next to us and I asked him for water.  He said okay.  15 more minutes he passed by again empty handed and I asked for a water refill.  He angrily said he will get to it and that they were busy.  I asked a passing waitress for the bill which she got to us about 20 minutes later.  It took another 15 minutes for them to pick up the credit card that I was going to pay the bill with.  15 minutes later when she finally brought the credit card slip back for me to sign I still had not gotten a water refill and my pregnant wife was really thirsty and irritated.  No one came to check on us and I wrote a note at the bottom of the credit card slip letting them know that we are regulars that have spent thousands of dollars at the restaurant and have been continually given poor customer service.  I let them know that this was not right and needed to change.  I did not leave a tip which they did not deserve, which is not usually smart if you are a return customer because they will undoubtedly spit in your food the next time you come.\n\nI returned 3 months later with my even-more-pregnant wife, my 3 kids and a head teacher of the local school who became a big fan after we introduced her to the food.  She has since turned 8 of her friends onto it as well.  As I walked towards the restaurant, I told my teacher friend that I had serious issues with the service at Pio Pio but the food is too damn good to deny. Little did I know I was about to be denied.\n\nWhen I walked through the door we were greeted by the skinny overly-plucked eyebrow person.  He walked past me and spoke to my wife with a big smile in spanish and basically told her the owner said we were banned from the restaurant for what we did the last time we were there. What? You mean tell you guys to treat us better? I asked to speak with the owner and was told he was not there.  We went back and forth for a minute or so and decided not to beg to eat there and we left.  He felt pretty good about kicking us out because he/she had a big old smile on his face. I decided we would handle the issue with the owner directly.\n\nMy wife called the restaurant asking to speak with the owner, who we've actually met and spoken with on several occasions.  He's a fellow New Yorker and was super cool when we met.  The head waiter/head busboy/manager guy who wouldn't refill our waters on our last visit answered the phone and said the owner will stand by what they said.  He then said if we have so many problems with the restaurant then why do we go back.  We did not call to speak with this idiot so we did not bother to explain.  \n\nDear Pio Pio owner- your waiters are horrible.  Today they kicked out 3 kids, a 7-month pregnant woman, a head elementary school teacher and me- all because we let them know that they need to step up their customer service.  You have lost our business and hard earned money.  You have lost our teacher friend's business.  You have lost her 8 friends' business.  All because of your waiters that don't treat minorities as equals."
1,"I had the opportunity to go to Which Wich on a recent Saturday afternoon, and my first impressions of Which Which are mostly positive.\n\nWhat I like most about Which Wich is the uniqueness of the joint.  The whole order via circling your choices on a pad with a pencil; ordering format works, and reminds me of a burrito-joint in Chapel Hill by the name of Armadillo Grill.  I like that there really are no set, pre-made subs.  Everything is made fresh to order and is tailored to your specific topping and sauce needs.  \n\nI will say that the parking lot was a little hectic and the inside felt a bit chaotic as well.  There weren't many available seats and it looked like the Tasmanian Devil had just run through the place.\n\nAs far as the actual taste of my sub, it was excellent.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and my sandwich was made to my specifications.\n\nDespite the interior, the service was excellent and the sub tasted good enough that I  would def like to return to Which Wich again, perhaps giving the location at the MET a shot."
0,"This once was to be a family favorite. We usually went every other week. The Fish selection once was plentiful. The value was good. However this is ass become less true over the recent years. \n\nThe fish selection both fresh and off the normal menu had dwindled. On my last trip they did not even have Salmon. The Mahi Mahi has been gone for years, and if there was ever tuna on the menu the price and the inability to cook it rare made it a poor choice. I went here with my family for one of our now rare trips there. The wait was short, and the service was pleasant. My main complaint was the menu. The only fresh fish were talipa, trout and one other option, I don't recall. \n\nI went with a full order of the trout, over their newish \""wood fire grill option.\"" I found that it imparts a stubble smoky char taste that works well with the high surface area of the trout. \n\nAs usual the meal came with a Cesar salad that was acceptable, and their butter, salt and cheese laden biscuits that are great way to add mass to yourself.\n\n Due to the lack of fresh fish my parents opted for an old favorite, the fried flounder. This is possibly the best fried fish out there. It is also one of the cheapest items on the menu. I recommend you try it at least once. \n\nUntil the fish selection grows and the ever increasing prices stabilize I won't be coming here too often. I just wish there was a good fish place on this side of town."
1,Great variety of food and flavors.  Service was excellent!!!
1,"Went to Sala Thai two nights ago, was very busy but received our appetizers in a short amount of time and entrees commensurate.  Small restaurants like this keep their costs down by mostly family running the place, so when we have been there, there has been momma cooking in the kitchen and daughter tending the front of the house.  Two people can only do so much so fast.\n\nWe have had Pad Thai in many places around Madison but we think this is the best, with the right noodles and sauce the limes, not lemons.  \n\nThe Vietnamese Egg Rolls were crispy and seemed fresh made and the peanut sauce was the perfect compliment.  \n\nThis time, I had the Curry Combo, which had potatoes, pineapple, green beans, pork, shrimp and chicken.  This had a red curry sauce that had just the right amount of heat for me.  Lots of pork and a good number of whole shrimp (watch for the ail shells which were still on) but I didn't find anything that seemed like chicken (though it may have had a similar texture to the pork).\n\nA very pleasant meal once again and a great place to go back.  The waitress remembers us every time."

0,"I've been here a few times with my boyfriend to watch Sunday football games.  Ick.  The place is so dark and hazy inside.  I just feel dirty being here.\n\nThe food is awful!!  I've had breakfast and lunch here.  The breakfast was the worst.  Just greasy and nasty.  The lunch (hamburger) wasn't inedible, but I've definitely had much better.\n\nI would much prefer going to a Zipps than coming here again."
0,"Frrrozen Hot Chocolate for $10?? You gotta be kidding me. Luckily, rewards points were used to pay for this. I mean, it was not gross, it was delicious, but not $10 delicious. It tasted like Hershey's syrup + melted ice + whipped cream.. the kind of shake you would get at the elementary school fair. I went to the take out line outside of the restaurant and it was service was soooooooooo slow, I mean ridic. slow just for a blended drink, while everyone else's orders were sundaes and blended drinks as well. \n\nAfter waiting for 30+mins, I asked the lady for my order.\n\n\""Hi, can you follow up on my frozen hot chocolate?\""\n\n*Shows receipt*\n\n\""Oh, hold on.\""\n\n*Lady grabs one of the bigass pitchers of already blended frozen hot chocolate and poors it into a cup and adds whipped cream and hands it back to me*\n\n\""Here ya go..\""\n\nWTF?!"
0,"The worst ever,I no kidding the worst customer service ever and only about half the time is pizza up to papa johns standard .why corporate has  not  for stepped in to totally clean house is amazing,years ago I quit calling them because they would instantly ask you to hold no matter what time of day you called them, not ever minute of day are they that busy,couple of years go by and  i thought  maybe corporate  came in  replaced the entire staff due to all the negative reviews on yelp and I do. Love papa johns pizza when it's done right so I thought I would give them a second chance since I was going to next closes papa  johns for years on boulder highway, so call in a  order using a coupon issued thru a flyer that states its for carry out only but not an online since some of the coupons do state online only but not this one which I had to argue with the call taker then he said he did not recognize the promo code at all,asked to speak with the manager he was the manager, great job job of corporate over sight guys.this one store could run the whole franchise into the ground."
0,"Waited forever to be acknowledged. The person that appeared to be the manager tried seating our party before one that was already in and waiting.\nWe got our meals, the kids (4 of them) ordered the create-a-scary-face pancake. After decorating we started to cut them up and they were completely raw in the middle. Not just undercooked, raw, dripping cold raw. The second set came out burnt. A happy medium not to be found here. \nThe manager did make it better but taking care of our bill."
1,"It was fun and lively for a Thursday night. Very scottsdale-ish... Tight dresses, tons of makeup and guys in affliction shirts...eww.  It was a mix of cougar and cougarettes, young and old...i mean mature:)  Casual and Dressy attire everywhere..\n\nThe bar was having a special on imported beer, and a guy bought a round of drinks for everyone there..so that is a plus for being in Scottsdale I guess. \n\nI'll try to go back sometime and try the food..."
0,"Decided to eat here before heading back to Long Beach based on the 4 star review on Yelp. \n\nI honestly can not figure out how this got an overall rating of 4 stars. My wife ordered a T-Bone breakfast and I ordered a New York Strip breakfast. \n\nWe both ordered the steaks medium-well but my wife's steak came out rare and my was overcooked and tough as leather. \n\nThe eggs, hash browns, and toast were average noting spectacular on par with a Denny's or Norms. \n\nThe service was ok, it took awhile for us to receive our check. \n\nI really hate that my first review was a negative one, but I really don't want anyone to see the 4 star rating and think it's a great place because unfortunately it is just below average."
1,"Wonderful!\n\n  I love this place.  I would have never tried it on my own, but a friend introduced me to it and I have loved it ever since.  They have a cool decor and great food.  I recommend the Panang Curry and Pad See Ewe.  Both are delicious.  \n\n  They have weird hours with a gap during the afternoon and are closed one day a week I think, but definitely a place worth checking out.  You wont be disappointed."
1,"Love this place. Consistent as can be, and service is top notch.\nOne might think, \""Hmm fajitas - doesn't that usually mean dry chicken and stiff steak?\""\n(at least that's what I thought) but I've been proven wrong time and time again at Juan's. Juan's fajitas are the benchmark of fajitas. It's almost as if the meats/proteins come out slightly rare on purpose, knowing that they will be the perfect temperature in about 30 flaming seconds, or the time in which it takes to assemble your first fajita and nab a first bite.\n\nIf you like fajitas, you will LOVE this place.\nIf you don't like fajitas, try Juan's and you will understand why fajitas exist.\n\n(Awesome salsa and bean dip, too.)"
1,"Good spot. Would liked to have seen a little more organization in the vinyl (ie. Maybe add markers showing alphabet), but had fun looking through old stuff.  Bought five records."
1,"Another tradition that my wife and I have when we visit Vegas is for us to get a full mani-pedi while we are there.  I was thinking about one of the 24/7 spots at night, but the reviews on those are so spotty that I started looking elsewhere.\n\nAfter doing a Yelp search, I found this place.  Service was very friendly.  So far, my wife's toes still look great (nice artwork) and her fingers are still pretty good after a couple of days--that's better than average.\n\nThey're going to have to do a lot to measure up to Colorful Nails in Tempe, AZ (our regular place now), but it was still a pretty good place to relax for a few hours in a massage chair.\n\nThanks folks.  The next time we visit Sin City, we may just return."
0,"Review of Restaurant Only\n\nSurprisingly walked in with no reservation at around 10ish for dinner. Great decor, good food, but I had higher hopes for the actual atmosphere of the place. \nPrices are up there, $28 dollar ravioli gets you 6 ravioli that are maybe an inch and a half in diameter. So if you're really hungry you might want to order an appetizer.\nThe food came out within 5 minutes before the bread made it out and we wound up getting our garlic bread with sauce to dip in when we were almost through with the meal. I could probably have eaten the whole plate of garlic bread myself. So good.\nTiramisu is a a large enough portion for 2 to easily share.\n\nThings I didn't like...\nThe square tables are awkward to sit at. the foot of the table blocks the space where your feet would normal be so if you decide to wear a dress like I did you wind up with your knees together and one foot on each side of the bottom of the table.\nPaper on the tablecloths are kind of annoying when you're paying almost $30 a plate.\nThe majority of people there seemed like groups of girls and the (pretty loudly) music made me feel like I was at a bachelorette or girl's 21st birthday. Girl's Just Wanna Have fun and the like played for most of the time I was there until they just gave up and played a Michael Jackson's greatest hits CD. Tables with groups of tipsy ladies squealed and stood up mid dinner to sing and dance at their tables accordingly.\n\nProbably wouldn't come back unless I was with a group that was dying to come here, especially since there's a Lavo in NYC now and its not somewhere I can only go on vacation."
1,"Good food, but portion sizes don't make much sense.  We ordered a half of the sampler appetizer, which was HUGE!  It was also very delicous.\n\nWe had also ordered a sandwich to share, and we were disappointed with the size of the sandwich.  Overall, everything tasted good, though nothing truly to write home about."
0,I love shrimp cocktail as long as the shrimp are de-veined. This place did not and I was unable to finish my $14 cocktail.
1,"I've been to Sweet Tomatoes a few times and I have to say, I like the new changes they're making.\n\nThe whole look on the inside is different - and in a good way. I like the new decor right when you walk in. It's a nice change, and makes everything look more modern and fresh.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I also like the new additions. I had the rotisserie chicken and the creamed corn and both were pretty darn good.\n\nOverall - it's nice to see them evolving and changing things up."
0,"Step one: buy a waffle maker. \nStep two: charge people for your mediocre waffles. \n\nI think this is Yola's business plan, though I am not certain. \nMy waffle was nothing special...it was even a little cold when it got to my table. I was disappointed."
0,"The parking and entrance to this venue leaves a lot to be desired.  I also would not suggest lawn tickets.  Ultimately, I doubt I would ever go to a show here again.  We left before Luke Bryan was probably half way through his set.  I found acoustics okay from my seat but wasn't going to get stuck in traffic forever getting out of parking lot.   A shame considering price of tickets."
1,"If there was a rating system for price, I'd give this place a 2 but being that every restaurant on the strip and in a hotel is expensive, I'll just level the playing field and ignore the price. In terms of the food and atmosphere, it was great! For an appetizer we ordered the edamame hummus which came with chips (although not enough and when we asked for just a few more chips, when we got the bill they charged us $3 for extra chips - not cool - you should tell us there is going to be a charge first). We also ordered the cod and the spider roll - both extremely good! I guess if we had gotten there just an hour earlier we could have gotten the same thing for half price - but oh well, good to know for next time!"
1,"I have been to this restaurant twice now and I have yet to have bad food. Both times I have been with another person and we swapped lots of food. Everything is pretty spicy but I was also able to order very traditional meals while there. The wait staff is young, but friendly without hovering. The atmosphere is low lit and quiet enough to enjoy a conversation with your food. The food is absolutely outstanding. I can't wait to go back for a third time and try something new."
0,Litteraly worst nail shop I've ever been too... The first girl put soo much acrylic all over my fingers that when I went to seperate the sides of my nail from my finger it ripped my skin off ... My nails have never stung more wile getting them done ... Than she put the wrong size nail on my middle finger ... Than in 5 days my brand new set a nail broke ....... So I felt like I had to go back so I could get matching polish .... A different lady put the wrong acrylic on my clear nails had to redo that and than questioned me y I wanted the nail polish the way I wanted it as if I wasn't a paying customer ... I will NEVER return here again !
1,"I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or brunch! The food is wonderful and they have a large variety of pancakes to choose from (blueberry is my favorite) and they have many other great breakfast items including omelets that are HUGE & delicious. They have sandwiches and lunch items as well. The prices are fair and the food is fresh. One negative is parking, which is very limited, but I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal."
0,"4 Stars? Put down the bongs everyone, come back to reality and look at what you're giving 4 Stars to. Sweet Tomatoes is what  happens when a bean counter accountant looks at a Golden Corral or Sizzler type salad bar and says what if we could build a restaurant around just the salad bar with a few non-steak extras thrown in to spiff it up? Imagine the cash we'll rake in. Hello Sysco, I want your cheapest product line....\n\nIf you haven't got my point by now you never will. Seriously, it's freakin cafeteria style food. I don't know about you but I have very bad memories of school cafeteria food. So handing me a tray and sending me down the line to pick out my choices brings not so good flashbacks. In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982. This is a place where I had an OMG WTF was I thinking moment when I tried to be polite to the people I was with and choke it down.\n\nToss in staff that are slow to clean the place up, screaming kids, and ho-hum bakery offerings and I see absolutely no reason to think of turning off Stephanie Street into a tight, usually packed parking lot to come here again. 4 Stars? Maybe if someone slipped me special brownies and I had the worst case of the munchies ever. Otherwise it's not only no but hell no. I love salad but every time I think it's a pain in the rear to round up all the ingredients I like for mine I just think of this place. I won't grumble when I go to the store and achieve a sneeze guard free salad experience after coming here. \n\nOh and this is another place where you'll be glad to know there's CVS and Walgreens locations close by for all of your upset stomach needs."
1,"I went to this place for the first time and wasn't expecting a whole lot after looking at the outside.  I figured it would be good though because we went there for my bosses birthday and I know he has the money to find good food.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the inside nice and roomy.  No overcrowding and it was clean.  \nThe food was great, I had the machaca beef chimichaunga enchilada style.  The serving was enough to feed me for two meals and I only added a little bit of salt, the flavoring was excellent."
0,"The food is ok and it feels more like cafeteria food.  To make it worst the food did not go well with my stomach, at all!!"
0,Good food; horrible service. I expect top notch service when dining at supposedly top notch restaurant.  Sat our group at a table that was practically falling off of the hinges. We were offered to move to a smaller set of tables where we all sat in a line versus a circle...so we declined. Called the manager over and he was at best indifferent. Taking my business somewhere else next time.....too bad
1,"Went here past 1am. The oyster bar which I've gone to multiple times was closed and the steak and eggs special Harrah's used to offer was gone. The burgers here were awesome though. Well, I take that back. The Philly Cheesesteak I had was pretty awesome, and well let's face it, food when you're buzzed is always going to be delicious. The tater tots were also pretty awesome and the waitresses were all quite attractive. Food is reasonably priced. Not bad, Harrahs."
1,"I'm a junior at ASU and drove past this place on university for THREE years until I finally went in....that was a mistake.  Now I go there whenever I can.   Though while on the outside, it looks like just a chain bagel place, its way more than that.  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYC...honestly, its that good.\n     My faves:\n         **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for), a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket, mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese, and a side of gravy. THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona, hands down.\n          **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami, corned beef, and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye).  It has it all, the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top"
1,"Can be a bit crowded at rush hours but not bad overall. For those people who think that Planet Fitness discriminate against people who work out with intensity then you haven't been to a PF or are doing it wrong. Wipe the equipment when you're done, rack your weights and don't slam the weights. Fyi if you are slamming weights then it's too heavy for you.  I crush the workouts and never have had the lunk alarm go off. \n\nThey are open 24-7 and the Black card membership is only $ 20 a month for any gym in the country. Can't beat that deal"
1,"We got here as part of the Calle 16 Jane's Walk last Sunday, and my 18 year-old daughter's eyes just lit up.  To make that happen nowadays takes something very special.\n\nThey have work by some of the original artists of Art Detour on up to hand made fashions by designers just starting out.  She got a painted Band Aid box from back in the day ...\n\nEclectic aesthetic by the people who are repurposing this '50s era insurance agency building - the architect-owner offices out of the old vault [originally used to store vital insurance documents in the pre digital age].\n\nThey let their designers do street art on the front street walls, thus joining the multicultural muralistas all up and down Calle Dieciseis."
0,"The inside is really nice with the views of the fountains. But I only give it 2 stars because the music was really crap. Some of the songs were played several times in the same hour or so we were there! I could play better songs on my iPod, and I'm no DJ! We got in for cheaper as we were staying at the bellagio, and as chicks we got 2 free drinks with a choice of vodka or champagne... Which was warm! The dance floor is very small due to the sectioned off areas at both ends of the d floor. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.... XS nightclub however was awesome!"
0,"Nice presentation, but the details are made of ick. \n\n1) Minor, questionable stains on my sheets and comforter. \n2) No plunger for bathtub. If you want a bath, you are SOL. Showers only here. \n3) Despite having no plunger, bathtub doesn't drain. Called at 6:30. Was told earliest would be 8.  It is 8:30 and plumber still has not arrived. I am here for a conference and am missing the first class because I can't take a shower. \n4) No coffee maker in room. Even cheap, sleazy hotels have coffee in the room. Does MGM need money that badly? \n5) Fridge in room is only for selling things. You cannot store your own things or you will be fined. \n6) TV worked occasionally. Frequently it just shuts itself off.\n\n\nAll in all, the room is spacious enough and check in went quickly, but the quality inside is really lacking. I expected more from a strip hotel. Very disappointed."
0,"This has got to be the worst customer experience of my life.  I now call them \""Divided Airlines\"".  Just make a call and you will get a different answer everytime. Currently I am on my 8th call and maybe now we are headed for a solution.  I am not going to expand anymore about the complete unprofessional response and solutions.  Companies have chosen to monopolize and outsource overseas and we the consumer lose.  One final note.. They have bar none the WORST coffee ever!!"
0,"Foodies beware!! This place is bad, bad, bad!! I don't even know where to begin! For starters, when we walked into the restaurant we got hit with such a weird smell. It was like a cross between mothballs and burnt wood. The building looked really old, and the inside was clearly outdated. They obviously didn't change a thing when they opened. Their leather menus have the name \""Kelly's\"" in bright neon.. Well actually Kelly green.. The K is backwards and there's a shamrock on the menu. This can be really misleading from the outside, because it looks and sounds like an Irish pub, not a steakhouse. \n\nThey have live entertainment from 6-10PM daily. Their idea of entertainment is an older man singing terribly to his piano. I joked with my husband and told him that I felt like I was in a nursing home. \n\nFor apps we ordered the steamed Manila clams. I hated them, the sauce was really salty and it tasted like a wine infused BBQ sauce. \n\nIn hopes that it would get better we both had the lobster bisque to follow. Again--- overly salty and the bisque tasted like it came from a can. It does come with a generous scoop of lobster though. \n\nAt this point, I was just looking forward to our steak. It arrived quickly. The waiter said they marinate them in a nice mixture of oils, salt, pepper etc. He proudly boasted that the steaks were high quality.... they weren't good :-( I love filet mignon. Matter of fact, Ive never had a bad steak night in Vegas, until now! \n\nWe also ordered their garlic mashed potatoes, truffled corn and creamed spinach. I'm absolutely sure that they use an instant mashed potato and just add a few fresh potatoes. The consistency was so gritty, you could just tell. The corn did not have truffle oil, or truffle anything. It was creamed corn with a breadcrumb crust on top. As for the spinach, it was watery, not seasoned and undercooked. \n\n\nI've never had a dinner in a restaurant where every aspect of the meal was this bad. This place will not survive with Mortons around the corner and Del Friscos across the street. \n\n\nPros:\n-The server was so nice, very attentive without being overbearing. \n-My martini was cold \n\nI wish I had more nice things to say, but it was just so terrible. No wonder they had such a great deal on groupon. We will never return. Yuck."
1,"I cant say enough about this place. I love the simple yet elegant food. Prices are ok. Wine is fantastic! Excellent atmosphere. Helpful wait staff. And yes, the butternut squash soup is to die for! Only regret is that I wished they toasted their bruschetta bread. Too soggy."
0,"This place is gross! First off the rooms smell, the towels smell and the carpet is filthy! One of my pillows was dirty and there was a hair on the comforter. It feels more like a truck stop then a hotel in Scottsdale. Couldn't wait to leave! \n\nI don't understand these other reviews, makes me think there fake!"
0,I fell in love with Tix when I first used them in NYC about 1.5years ago. \nTix in Vegas is a far cry from the experience that I had with TIx in other cities. \n\nTix in vegas has long slow moving lines. The lines in NYC is alway long but it is moving fast. The problem with Tix in Vegas is that they try to upsell you with other deals when you are next in line as well as at the counter. They actually hold me at the line even though there is an empty counter for me. \n\nI'm not sure why but Tix in Vegas doesn't allow you to confirm your seating unlike those in NYC. I had to go to the box office in the show location to confirm the seats. \n\nAnother downside is that people who buys from Tix gets lousy seats in vegas. I came to know this as when i was told by the staff at the box office that the only seats available for me are limited even though the section that i had paid for is less than half filled.\n\nThis didn't happened to me when I brought show tickets in other cities \n\nThe actual discount was BS. It was less than the advertised 40% off. Tix on Vegas  sure makes more profit by taking in majority of the discounted prices as their profit. \n\nYour odds at the black table is definitely better than buying good discounted tickets from Tix Vegas.
1,yum scrum! i am a fan.\n\ni get two chicken skewers and a veggie skewer. seriously so bomb diggity. and the lunch prices are right up my alley at around $8. \n\nthe soda fountain is fun too
1,Great venue for music..friendly staff...great food truck food..booze is only point reduction
1,"Depending on your style or clothing preference, this outlet may be or may not be for you.  If you're more in to the higher type class clothing I suggest you head out to the premium outlet near downtown vegas but if you're in to surfing brands, good kicks, and skinny jeans, this place is for you.\n\nLevis is always having great discounts on their jeans so before you go paying for it full priced at the near by Town Square, this place is just about 5 min drive away and if you want to save, why not check it out.\n\nQuicksilver, Hurley, Billabong, and even Oneil are all here, so duuude come on braaaah, check these places out for totally awesome sales duuude.  \n\nNow for the kicks....Nike, Adidas, Converse and other great brand names are here too.  Im not really knowledgeable when it comes to how much these shoes should be compared to whats out there because all I buy are chucks so I can't really tell you whether the deals here are great or not.  \n\nThis place isn't as nice or as big as the Premium but its really close to where I live and has all the stores I prefer and this is the reason for my 4 star."
1,"I had an awesome time playing at the World Series of Poker as well as seeing the energetic wait staff dance periodically.  The Seafood buffet is amazing, be careful of the line ( We players didnt have to wait,...) , the pool scene was fun, ( including the topless area) Thank you to the staff and management of the Rio for an awesome time!"
1,"I wish that this place was in Gilbert, or that my work took me to Glendale more often. This place is fantastic! It's hidden down a little side alley off of Glendale just east of 58th (where the address is listed) and I had almost given up looking for it this morning - glad I didnt. It's very cute and homey feeling, decorated with belongings and gifts of the owners (according to a sign on the bar). The lady behind the desk waz very sweet and joked with me while I waited for my drink. The chai latte was delicious and I could see by the percolator and espresso machine in the back that if I hadnt given up caffiene I would likely love the coffee too. It was a little slow at 10:30 am so the lady even took the time to check on me to see how my drink was. You can tell this is a local treasure and the next time I have to work in Glendale I will definitely be back!"
1,"If any of you in Las Vegas need plumbing repair/assistance of any kind, call Number One Plumbing, Heating, Air Conditioning. With the courtesy of my neighbor, I had discovered that the water pipe fixture on the side of my house (the one that controls the main water line and the pressure) had cracked and was leaking.  It was only until a week passed when I had decided to get it looked at (the crack actually got bigger over time and was leaking more water).  Having had prior experience with another company in Las Vegas to fix our water temperature problem, I was quite skeptical and afraid of the type of service I would receive for plumbing--the man at Larkin not only raised his voice at me on the phone but they only cared about giving us temporary fixes to our temperature problem.  However, that was not the case when I used Number One Plumbing.\n\nI called Number One Plumbing and the lady on the phone was prompt and friendly.  She then sent  a plumber to come at around the time when she said they would come, and the plumber Bill called me ahead of time to let me know he was on his way.  When Bill and Jeremy came over, they not only replaced the fixture within 10 minutes, but they explained the way the pipes and knobs work as well as taught me how to keep my pipe from cracking again in the future.  Talk about helping me keep my pipes in tact permanently instead of giving me BS ways to increase me costs!  They were even upfront about the costs and gave me a DISCOUNT!  And most importantly, they were the most personable and considerate plumbers I have ever met, unlike *cough* Larkin (who gave me attitude on the phone a couple years back).  I'm only posting this because they truly deserve pounds of cheesecake for putting me at ease.  In a city where customer service is not up to par with other states, this company is a diamond in the rough."
1,"The light shows here are super cool.\nI love their decorations, and even though it's no Bellagio Gardens, I dig it...almost makes me feel like I'm not in Las vegas.\n\nWhile we haven't eaten/gambled here, we have stopped by Calamity Jane's ice cream shop. Which serves dryers..... I could have got that at the store, but okay.\nWhen we were there, the employee was quite involved in a conversation, with non customers. She seemed pretty irritated that we interrupted that."
0,The service was lousy. An elderly attendant w/glasses was very short with us customers.  I had to repeat my order for coffee. She said have a nice day; but in s way that felt F-you. Geeeeez.
1,"As full time RIvers who really like Thai food it's often difficult to find \""good\"" Thai food. Last Wednesday after an appointment in downtown Phoenix we searched Yelp for a Thai Restaurant on our way back to Casa Grande, AZ. We found this restaurant not far off the 10 in Chandler which has recently opened.  The service was very friendly.  Pricing was very good.The restaurant was very clean and welcoming. The Spring Rolls, Fried Pineapple Rice with Chicken was amazing. Since we are Snow Birds we will be back! The new owner is doing a great job and should be very successful."
1,"Just breakfast and lunch, with an emphasis on breakfast. I love that the waffle and pancake choices include not only what they put ON them, but also what goes IN them. I had orange/cranberry IN the batter, and strawberries and bananas ON my waffle. It was really good but the cranberries were a bit overwhelming. It's about $3 more to add bacon and eggs if you're hungry enough for them. I stuck with the waffle and was completely satisfied. They had a breakfast special running with marinated steak that look and smelled wonderful. Maybe I'll venture away from my usual next time and give that a try. You can spend from $5 to $15 per person so if you're watching the budget (like I am toward the end of the month) you can still find a good breakfast."
1,"You gotta love a place that gives you free samples of any and all flavors for you to try! I'm lactose-intolerant and how sad my life was before I found the Gelato Spot! They have AWESOME sorbet that is so luxurious and rich that you won't even notice that it is dairy-free!! All my lactose tolerant friends savor their opulent gelato! The employees are very nice, helpful and friendly! When I bring a friend who is new to the wonderful world of Gelato, I love the size their eyes get when they see all the flavor options. Forest Berry sorbet is THE BEST!!!!"
0,"Unfortunately BaD experience. Approx. $2000 cash spent & results immediately Not symmetrical as per his physician technique. My appointment was about 30mins of physician time. I was in a ton of pain following ( my threshold high)  & Although the doctor was quite polite & casual he stated he would not be able to make a correction for six months to one year. Completely brushed me off ;however , I TRUSTED upon my return he would correct @ no cost. \nUpon my return he stated there would be an additional $2000 charge! The equivalent price of doing the procedure from scratch. \nAlso, @ each visit he tried to up sell me on a ton of fillers etc. ,Quite insulting. He left me with 3 large SCARS that people have asked me about. :( I was mortified through the process & photographed/logged the damage. I have realistic expectations & need to seek legal counsel for reimbursement.\nThe office called me & even asked me to Exchange a $100.00 bill for a different one! I'd Never had such a bizarre request made. The office was Completely unprofessional after my money collected & I was treated terribly by the staff. Assistant carting crying baby around office while working? Choose another office. Totally unethical."
0,"Spent our New Years Eve with Central Bistro.  The service was the worst we have had in years, waiter not only rude, not knowledgable about what was on the menu.\nWill never go back or to any other concept by this company."
1,"Oh my gosh Nola - now when this place opened everyone talked about it and loved it and raved and I never went. Finally this weekend I got the chance to experience and I thought it was great. The wine selection (which was what I wanted) was great and to be honest I just wanted some pasta so when they turned out to have pasta I was a happy camper. I very much recommend the dish I had, the Pasta Pontchartrain. There was a little kick to the sauce and the meat and crawfish in the dish were perfect.  Everyone in my party had a great meal - I'm pretty sure the grit cakes were called the best meal my dining partner had ever had. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the environment was fun -I'm going to go ahead and highly recommending trying this place."
0,"Our first clue should have been that it was Friday night and there were only a few tables full.  This place has really gone downhill. They used to have excellent artisan breads, now you get breadsticks you can buy in a big bag at Albertsons for five bucks. They are warmed up and sprinkled with granulated garlic.\n\nThe house salad was generic and the spaghetti and meatballs couldn't give Chef Boyardee a run for his money. \n\nThe staff was professional, friendly and attentive.  Too bad the food they have to serve is so sub-par. Typical of big casino management trying to get by on the cheap. Granted the food is inexpensive but paying more to enjoy a good meal is worth it.  I would have done better to stay home with a jar of Rag\u00f9."
0,"I LOVED this place when Aly Gillmore was the head stylist, she always groomed my Coton De Tulear's into their natural and beautiful coat. Without notifying me that Aly, left the girls were booked with Cindy.She tried to convince me that is best to keep shaved so they stay cooler in the summer months, dispite my vet and Aly Gillmore taught me the exact opposite, as they need their hair for protection from the sun also more importantly works as natural cooling system for them!!!  This concept best and easiest for groomer, and shows little knowledge about what's healthiest for the dog. . This place was BOMB until they lost Aly Gillmore to A Happy Dog Wash!!"
1,"The supreme breakfast burrito is the number one breakfast burro in chandler, a must try for all.  I am impressed with the meat portions in the taco/enchilada combos as well..the downers...they desperately need some spicy hot sauce.  I hope to see this place do well and stick around for a long time to come.  I would also like to see the owner be a little tougher on a few of his employees (dress code, on the phone while working, smoking out front, etc). Overall, great spot to fill the hunger void for less than $10.00..giant drinks as well."
1,I think the problem here is management. Enough said.
0,"Eh...it was OK. Brought my sons caregiver, my son (13) and myself...it was 58$!!! holy hella expensive!! My child has autism, so I wasn't sure what to expect from him with all the butterflies flapping about. We first saw the movie, which is good if you like 3-D stuff...but for me it just made me nauseated and gave me a bit of a headache. My son was NOT thrilled with the butterflies, and was shooing them away from him and trying to shoo them away with his foot too, so one of the workers got all in a tizzy about this...as if he was going to go kill the butterflies  or something...sheesh!!  While I was there I saw 4 people step on butterflies, and my son didn't even so much as graze against one....the guy clearly didn't understand the disability, or was just an ass...:(( the sting ray thing was ok as well, but not overly exciting...my son did seem to like that, but likely because he liked the fish in the tank, and water in general. Over all it was just Meh.....overpriced....WAY overpriced...I went, I saw....and now I don't think I will go again.....not until the other stuff is done in 2 years. This  is just MY experience...I'm sure others enjoyed it, but I didn't."
0,The Hilton Hotel in not what it looks like in the pictures. The pool is tiny and the rooms are disgusting! I would recommend a place like Mandelay Bay or The Belagio.
0,"First time checking this new LA Fitness out was Sunday, I did legs and it was about 6PM and there was decent amount of people there! The place look great! Great cardio machines witch has TV's and ipod chargers so that was great! And then I went back today and wow! parking lot was full! and I wasn't happy near the dumbbell area...dumbbells where everywhere!!! There was more dumbbells missing on the rack then there was on the floor! Wonder where they went...also the people there just chat chat chat! no working out! just standing there in front of the machines and such and just chat away! but overall its a nice place but ehhh just the atmosphere."
1,"I'm not big into the club scene, but this place is awesome.  They hire some of the most AMAZING DJs from all over the world.  I saw Avicii at XS back in April, and it was such an awesome experience (kind of like an intimate concert).  The DJ who opened for him was also amazing (don't know her name but she looked like a young 20-something cute little thing).  Both played one hit after another.  I love that you can hang out on the patio and just catch your breath outside, and STILL be able to watch the show.\n\nMy only complaint is that they definitely let WAY TOO MANY people into this joint.  I may even venture to say that they were over capacity at certain parts of the night, but the crowd somehow died out and once we got away from the dance floor, we had room to breathe."
0,"Three of us went for dinner at 5:30 pm and were seated.  We ordered drinks and meals and dessert.  At 6:30 pm , the manager or owner came up to our table and told us we needed to leave the table as the reservations party had arrived.  We were never told this when we were seated.  This has never happened to us and we are 66 years old.  We were really taken back and will not be going here again to eat.  It was very rude and uncalled for."
0,"We drive by this strip mall frequently so thought we'd try Tosinos.  Completely forgettable, average food that tastes like it might have been frozen.  We won't be back.  I recommend you drive up Power to McKillips and eat at Senior Tacos instead."
0,"This restaurant has a great decor and vibe and definitely ample outdoor space. Their food tastes great and the beer was cold with good service.\n\nI had the shrimp and crab stuffed greenpeppers. The shrimps were the size of my thumbnails. Since there was no lights at our table, I couldn't see the crab meat to confirm there was any crabmeat present. I certainly couldn't taste any crabmeat. My wife had a shrimp fajita which would be a children's version at Chili's if Chili's had such a dish.\n\nBottom line, my wife and I walked away hungry after spending $53 for dinner."
1,"I went here on Saturday with my 2 rug rats, the baby, and the husband.  I hadn't been to Mary Coyle's since I was a kid and it was still in its original location on Thomas Road.   I was please to see they still had the mountain of ice cream that I fondly remembered from my childhood, but at the $75 price tag, there was no way MY kids were gonna get to repeat my same memory.  And while I know it wasn't $75 back then (inflation being what it is, and all) I'm still trying to figure out how my mom and dad, who were perpetually broke, swung the undoubtedly high cost back then...?\n\n\nAnyway, I digress.  The pink and white decor was cute, but it seemed a tiny bit dingy around the edges in some places.  Example: The tables had very cute, colorful Gerbera daisy arrangements, but the glass vases weren't exactly sparkling clean...  The waitress' pink skirt had stains on it that I immediately noticed...needed washing.  That kind of thing.\n\nOur waitress was very sweet, and quite attentive.  She gave us grownups pink paper menus and the kids got kiddie menus with crayons.  Paper menus normally don't bother me, but these adults menus were a bit wrinkled and I'm of the school of thought that if you are using paper menus you need to toss them out as soon as they show ANY wear.  They need to be crisp and smart looking.  You may save a nickle in printing costs, but it looks cheap overall.\n\nSo the food was delicious, I got a half soup and sandwich plate; my potato soup was fabulous (big chucks of perfectly cooked potatoes, green onion, bacon and cheddar cheese) and my Reuben sandwich was quite tasty, although a bit too 'saucey' and messy.  The kids each respectively had a hot dog and macaroni and cheese with a side of Poore Brother's Potato Chips, they ate all of it.  My husband had a French dip sub and ate the whole thing.   To finish our food we ordered the 9 scoop banana split, and the waitress had no issue with our request to substitute a couple of scoops of coffee ice cream in place of the vanilla.   (The boys had their little hearts set on trying the coffee ice cream!) \n\nThe ice cream was fabulous.  Just the perfect combination of sweet and creamy, with whipped cream, a cherry, fresh strawberry, pineapple and hot fudge toppings and roasted, chopped nuts (served on the side).\n\nI was very pleased with this late lunch.  I will come back for sure, I do have a couple of small suggestions for the management though.\n\n-Please toss out the paper menus more frequently.\n\n-Do not reuse the disposable, plastic kids cups.  (My 6 year old received one that looked like it'd seen a few different meals and it was creepy.  Maybe it was just scratched up from being slipped inside another cup, maybe, but it looked like it was used.)\n\n-The fluorescent lighting in the ladies room is horrendous.  It makes the ladies appear green and sickly when they stand under it and adjust their make up in the mirror.  This leaves us with an unpleasant feeling that makes you want to get out of the rest room as quick as possible.  Maybe that needs to be softened with an incandescent bulb, or dual vanity lights on either side of the mirror?\n\n-The security camera glaring down at people in the dining room is a bit unsettling.  Is your location really that dangerous that you feel the need for such a conspicuous video camera?  I bet you can conceal that in a corner someplace and make the place seem more inviting overall.\n\nThanks for a great family lunch!"
0,The food is over priced for the size of portion that is received.  Also no chips and salsa except on Friday and Saturday night.  But the worst thing is the owner.  He is such a rude jerk.  I have dined here for the last time.
1,"A nice setting with enough variety of Greek food that everyone in your party can find something they will eat and enjoy. \nThe Spanakopita was tasty and crisp and the Baklava, though made with pistachios and not walnuts, was crisp and not soggy. The pita bread could have been softer(fresher ?)"
0,"My bad experience started in the beginning, I pre-paid for a room with a King size bed.\n\nMy wife and I where trying to get away for awhile.  They gave away my room and stuck me with two queen size beds.  I was PRE-PAID. \n\nIt set a bad tone for our stay,  I did enjoy \""Red Square the restaurant\"" -  But that is seperate management (owners)\n\nWe moved the next day, but I will not go back to Mandalay. Not even for the restaurant."
0,"Overrated! We heard so much about the frozen hot chocolate ($10) - it sounded so interesting but at the end of the day it's nothing special - save your money and run to a Coffee Bean or Starbucks and order a frozen drink - they're much better and cheaper!\nOn the other hand, we ordered the red velvet sundae - that was excellent and much better than the hot chocolate. Still, $12 for a sundae. Save the calories and time for something else but if you MUST go because someone in your party insists, get the sundae. (20-30 min for to go window with a line of only 10 people). You've been warned!"
1,"Came in for an alignment. Hands down, best price in town! Customer service is top notch. It is a family owned small business but sometimes it's best to trust with your vehicle. I will be returning even it's on the other side of town for me. Worth it! Glad I found them on Yelp!"
1,"So excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and tasty. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff. \n\nThe things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu. \n\nService was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait. \n\nWendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!"
0,"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go there!\n\nThis place is a ripped off. Spent $800 on 4 brand new tires with warranty and blah blah blah. Come to find out 2 months later while I was driving out of the state one of my tire had a big bulge on it. Gave them a called since my tires are still under warranty they said they will order me a tire which will take about 2 days. 2 days turned into 6 months! After 20 calls they told me my tires were on back order. Of course you're tire store and you don't have them instock. Thankfully I did have a full size tire to drive on while I waited on my \""back order tire\"" to come in.\n\nAt first this place sounds like a promising honest shop. They convinced me that my car need transmission flush, brake fluid flush and another flush which I don't remember what it was. If I do all three jobs I'll get $70 off. Sounds like a great deal so I had them done since it needed to be done anyway. My car hit 100,000 miles , I took my car in for a tune up at my friend's garage. He looked at what my car needed and told me the brake fluid is dirty. How could it possibly be when I just had it done at BIG O????\n\nI work in a restaurant near by, one day I got a phone call from them saying that why do we have our to go menu there since they say no soliciting. I don't know why maybe a customer came in to eat and grab a to go menu then go get their car fix at Big O. The guy on the phone ask me if I can do something like give them a free meal for being \""Soliciting\"" I was like are you kidding me? I'm so done with this place."
0,"Awkward layout. The trek to get to the pool is strange, and once you get to the pool be ready to hike around the barricade of lounge chairs. The rooms are nice if you get a fancy suite. If you don't, avoid the \""Shining\"" fourth floor. We had a ghetto room with no room number placard. Instead, on the wall the numbers 4011 were written with black Sharpie pen."
0,if you think this is the place to buy a car.\nBEWARE! They tricked me into signing a lease.
0,"Annoyed every time I come here now. Used to be great but has gotten worse with each visit. Bad management I think. Ahh, confirmed that. Just now, my wife's wine glass had lipstick on it. Not her's, new glass. Management was huffy.  Not anymore. Trying Epicenter dinner theater."
0,"Ok, so I WAS going to give this place 4 stars, maybe even 5, but after having a great b-fast there last week I thought I would take all of my family who is in town this week, to b-fast there this Sunday. When I called to make reservations for 8 people, I was told they don't take reservations on the weekends, As if, you would need them any other time. So I kindly told the guy on the phone, well- you're loosing my business. He, of course, had no reponse. He is the same guy who wonders why at 30 hes working at a restaurant.\n\nand i seriously don't want to hear THIS local business WHINE about the bad economy making them close. I will tell them to SHUT UP  b/c they just turned down 8 people who drink a ton of alcohol and give good tips. \nI can guarantee they'll whine anyway, and then close, and then wonder what happened. Everyone will be shocked but me. It might not be this year, but trust me with that kind of customer service--people will go elsewhere."
1,"I came upon SnowFlake Shavery after having lunch in the same plaza and was pleasantly surprised we found this place. The area was definitely in need of a good shaved snow place and Shavery did not disappoint. I've had my share of shaved ice and shaved snow and Shavery is definitely one of the better ones (even compared to LA standards). \n\nFor those that don't know, the ice is actually frozen with the flavor so when it is shaved, it is actually shaved in what looks like thin ribbons and not ice chunks. This gives the snow its creamy texture and much better flavor. There are numerous flavors to choose from and if you don't know, just ask as the servers are more than willing to provide you with some recommendations and even a small sample. They do have various options of pre-built combinations or you can build your own. \n\nI'm definitely looking forward to my next taste and flavor of SnowFlake Shavery."
0,"In the past I would have advised hardcore gamblers to stay and play\ndowntown. I believe those days are long gone. Now I wouldn't advise\nmy worst enemy to venture down here unless he had a sudden urge \nto get mugged or murdered. The city made an effort to elevate this\narea by installing the roof and the light show,and having a constant\npolice presence during business hours. For a while it worked. On my\nlast two visits it appeared that this area has gone back to its roots.\nStreet people of every persuasion have reclaimed Fremont Street,\nand are forcing the tourists back to the Strip. I think the city has \nthrown up its hands and decided that the extra patrols are not cost\neffective,that the bums and prostitutes are too numerous to deal with.\nTo make a short story even shorter: I'll never stay in,gamble in or\nvisit this area again."
0,"My husband, and I, often dine here on Friday or Saturday nights for their Prime Rib & Crab.  Last few times we came, there were knats flying near & on our food, the prime rib looked days old & it tasted that way too.  The buffet selection looked old & unappealing & usually my favorite part, the crab legs, were salty, like they were soaked for too long in water & salt.  The quality has really gone out the door, which explains why there are very little customers, plus the prices have gone up dramatically!!  Hope they read this, cause they need to improve in a major way!  I spoke to one of the managers regarding the prime rib, but the reaction was like he did not care!!  Never again!"
1,"Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it's hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone, it's nice to walk into one every once in a while."
1,Hesitant to come here at first despite all the good reviews. It's just the concept of paying for a meal where the star attraction is the noodles and the dipping sauce it comes in just isn't that appealing. I'm used to a bowl of noodles where the broth is the highlight of the dish or the ingredients are and the noodles just complement as well as add some filling in the bowl.\n\nBeing this was my first time at I-Naba i opted to try the evening's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for 18. Portions were small which reflects traditional Japanese style. I didn't remember to take a picture of the tasting menu. With that in mind i'm going to describe what came out without knowing their proper names or the other option available.\n\n1st course - braised mackrel \nServed cold which was a surprise to me but still pretty good. The sauce they braised in it was light and refreshing and paired quite nicely with the mackrel \n\n2nd course - deep fried shrimp with a hunk of fish cake attached to it served with fried tofu and eggplant in sauce\nThe fish cake is very Japanese which is the only way i can describe it. Flavored with herbs and heavy with course cuts of vegetables. not exactly what i was expecting with it comes to fish cake but it was still nice. \n\n3rd course - Bowl of udon soup with slices of rib eye\nEven though this place is known for it's soba noodles the udon is excellent. The broth was light and refreshing as well as complemented the udon noodles quite well.\n\n4th course - shaved watermelon ice with sesame ice cream\nThe sesame ice cream had honey drizzled over it and was a small scoop but packed a very rich and pleasant sesame taste. They did an excellent job shaving the watermelon ice as it wasn't prone to melting quickly and had a rich watermelon taste.\n\nNot exactly what i was expecting at all when i came here but will gladly return.
1,"After having brunch at nearby Crepe Expectations, even though we were completely stuffed, Allison S. and I couldn't resist stopping by Popped to get some munchies for later. \n\nPopped is located in a fairly busy shopping center with ample parking. I found the actual store to be a bit on the small side and it was hot and humid inside, I am unsure if they were having issues with their air conditioning perhaps?\n\nA friendly female employee welcomed us and offered us samples of all sorts of delicious popcorn. In fact even after we had made our purchases, she was still offering up more samples. \n\nI ended up with 3 small bags of popcorn:\n\nJalapeno - For my husband. I didn't care much for it, but I don't do jalapeno flavored anything. \n\nChili Limon - From the special menu, the only thing I didn't get to sample. I knew my husband would love it based only on the name and I was right. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it as well\n\nPink'Adelic - I knew as soon as I read the description I wanted it. White chocolate, raspberry, pop rocks AND nerds?! Count me in. \n\nWith the 15% Off Yelp offer, my total was just over $10. My husband and I munched on our popcorn all weekend, it's delicious and super addictive. I will certainly be \""popping\"" into Popped in the future for more delicious sweet and salty snacks!"
0,"I was excited to try this place as I have heard of conveyor belt sushi and it sounded fun. I never realized it meant the same sushi going around and around and around again....as in getting old or cold if supposed to be hot (like the baked mussels). If you truly love sushi for the fish, skip this place. You get what you pay for, and at about $3/roll, that's what you get-most roll options were of the mayonnaise variety or tempura and the tempura wasn't good. The rice wasn't fresh either and I kept wondering if the rolls were a day old already. Too bad."
1,"Finally got a chance to check this place out and man am I happy. It was a little busy, but we were able to get a table lickety split. I had the meat lover's scramble which came with rosemary potatoes and toast. Wifey had the two egg breakfast, and a cinnamon roll for us to split. Just a good meal. I super dig the potatoes, and my eggs were perfect. Wifey and I both threw down on the awesome cinnamon roll, which was great!  I'll definitely be back, what a killer breakfast"
1,"Strange as it may feel to order something called the \""Philly Steak Pita\""--on the same menu with the \""Macro Platter\"" (steamed veggies and tofu)--the Philly is one of the best items you can get here. It's finger-searing hot, a dripping mess of thin-sliced beef with grilled peppers, onions, and melting mozzarella cheese, a satisfying handful of goodness that's begging for an extra dollop of hummus or garlic sauce to create a stream of perfect bites. All for less than 7 bucks.\n\nI've been going to Pita Jungles for at least 15 years now, starting at the location by ASU and now mostly at this Chandler location. It's our standby when we want something on the healthy side. Very few items on the menu have ever disappointed, and the bang-for-the-buck here is high. \n\nBeyond the Philly, my favorites include: grilled veggie salad, chicken combo, and the lavosh shawarma wrap.\n\nI'd agree that the service can occasionally be a little snooty, trying to be a bit too-hip-for-you, but generally, we get good service here."
1,"Went here for lunch with my fianc\u00e9. The restaurant was much bigger than I was expecting. I liked the large booths, and the decor was nice.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had the oysters, and they were wonderful. He was impressed.  Unfortunately he has a lot of food allergies. Gluten, dairy, tomatoes. So it limits his choices. They hardly have anything he could eat. He pan seared halibut minus the butter. It was just okay. \n\nI had the Tide Roast. It was excellent! Next time I would just get the plain rice. The dirty rice didn't do much for me. I loved the hot sauce they brought with the bread!  I added that to my Tide Roast, and it gave it a nice kick. \n\nToo full for dessert. Service was ok. Nothing amazing. Overall I would go back, but my fianc\u00e9 would only go for the oysters.  There wasn't much else he could have."
1,"Simple but awesome.   We enjoy a quick in and out dinner with a nice selection.   We've eaten here probably 10 times and NEVER had a bad experience.   The food is always good, hot, and fresh.  The servers are friendly, and the owner makes a point of genuinely getting to know you.  The beef tips are one of my favorites.   Great slaw and of course they are famous for their fried squash."

0,"I'd read about these hipster-Brooklyn barber shops in the NYTimes so after checking this place out online, I was real hyped up about coming here. Looked really cool outside & in (dimly lit, Apple computer, street art books, jazz playing), & the happy customer photos made me want to be like Mike. So I got a cut & shave ($25) & it was a very mixed experience. Long story short: I got home, looked in the mirror, & busted out w/ the scissors, Mach razor, & hand mirror. Hair-wise, there were a lot of missed spots (tufts, not strands) on the top/sides/back & shave-wise, the lower portion of my face felt & looked like a prickly cactus. I was pissed & vowed never to fall for the hype again, but at the same time, I enjoyed sitting in that chair & being taken care of (while there, I tried to be as hopeful & positive as possible but the tsunami of reality hit me like a 2 x 4). I was shocked & disappointed. I don't want to micromanage people who should be more knowledgeable than me. I just want to sit, chill, & enjoy the experience, then get up, pay, & walk away looking like a million bucks, not a food stamp card.\n\nThe irony of this experience is that I was hoping to find an escape from the bad haircuts you get at chain stores full of beginner I-don't-know-what-I-want-to-do-with-my-life hacks who can't cut it (pun intended) anywhere else. Also from the old barbers who give you outdated hairstyles & offer you porn and the beauty salons full of estrogen. This place izza RZA fo' shizza hack in hip clothing.\n\nThe search continues for an intuitive barber... #OnwardAndUpward!\n\nThis is more of a one-time novelty thing that curious guys (remember what happened to the cat?) need to get out of their system just to say that they tried it, but did not inhale. Thumbs down.\n\nCustomer, beware. In the ongoing battle between Style vs. Substance, I say, \""Go Substance! Go elsewhere\"" (yes, it was that bad).\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this mess was the compliments I got on Monday at work about how nice I looked after shaving my face & cutting my own hair.\n\nMoral of this story: Anything you can do, I can do better (and I lived happily ever after).\n\nThe End."
1,Michael is great!  Wonderful customer service & the lechon is amazing!  I will be back for sure with my family!!
0,Okay the only reason this hotel has a star is because one is the minimum.  My daughter and I came out to Tempe for orientation at ASU - upon entering the front lobby I realized this was a hold over from 1970 - don't know where they got the pictures online but not at this flea bag. We walked into the room the air - conditioning smelled like it was causing an electrical fire - there was a hole in the wall near the outlet - the place was filthy right to the towels hanging in the bathroom. Do yourself a favor and skip this dump! We didn't stay more than 15 minutes and even at that I was afraid of what else I would see. The front desk thought it was amusing to inform me that the computer and printer in the front lobby are ancient and probably picked up at a second hand auction.
1,"I'm particularly excited about a new establishment in this end of Lawrenceville since I live in the area.  I've been to Alchemy N Ale multiple times for drinking, once for brunch, and tried my first pierogi since coming to Pittsburgh.  I have not dined in the dining room so cannot speak for the servers, but the male bartenders and owner are fantastic-really fantastic.\n\nI cannot compare pierogi's since they were my first, but I thought they were tasty enough.  I've heard great things about the salad and can't wait to try it.  The brunch was fantastic.  I had the yogurt (greek), granola (with candied ginger) and fruit.  Way too much granola, but it was delicious.\n\nThe Moscow mule is very good and the copper cup it comes in is a nice subtlety.  I do wish they had a drink menu and more liquor to choose from.  For example, they don't have any brandy or cognac to make a sidecar-which I think is a basic drink.  I'd like to see a menu with specialty drinks (and listed prices!!), mostly because I never know what to order or much about cocktails, and it's easier to pick one off a list.  And I want to know what it costs before I order it-sorry, I hate when bars don't list prices.\n\nI will be back many times, and sit at the bar.  It's nicely decorated (the lighting is a bit odd), usually aptly busy without too much ridiculousness, and there's ample street parking.  And I like that I can be dressed up with heels.  Be sure to check it out at least once."
1,I've been looking for something like this for a while.. and i've tried many of these prepared meal programs.. but this one is the BEST.  I love the portion sizes and the freshness of each meal.. I can grab a pack and run off to work .. eat it there and i'm not feeling like I'm off my meal plan all the time.   I open it up and almost everyone is asking where i got it from.. the vegges are green and fresh... the meats are tasty and the package is easy to use.   I can't recommend it enough..  I am hoping this is an long and ongoing relationship I'll have with Body Food Kitchen.
1,"I'm not typically a sweets eater. I usually prefer savory to sweet, I'd rather have dinner than dessert any day. I crave pie maybe once a year, and today was that yearly occurrence. \n\nI've been wanting to try Mamma Toledo's ever since I had brunch at Short Leash about a week ago. My friend and I were having serious sweet tooth cravings so off we went in pursuit of pie. \n\nI find it to be slightly odd that Mamma Toledo's is located inside of the short leash restaurant, and that hasn't really been touched on very much in other reviews. When I called to see if Mamma Toledo's was open before heading out, no one answered. We took a risk and headed down anyway. \n\nThere were so many delicious options, it was mind blowing. We almost went home with four different varieties. We settled on two, apple crumble and chocolate cherry creme respectively. Although, I think we both wish that we had taken home a brown sugar peach and a pecan as well. If only Mamma Toledo's served pie by the bite. What a wonderful world that would be. I'm sincerely concerned about becoming a Type II Diabetic with Mamma's being so nearby. \n\nMamma, please consider selling pie by the bite, my waistline and taste buds would be appreciative. I can't wait to go back, Mamma Toledo's may have created a pie-eating monster."
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE! To start off.....It was my boyfriend's birthday and he's not one to like birthdays. Myself, being the event planner I am, wanted to make his birthday special and I wanted him to have an amazing time! So I got him a table at firehouse. \n\nWe get there, skipped the line and told the guy I had a table. He then called the manager over, Josh, and he SO kindly escorted us to our table and got us settled right in. He got me THE best table in the house over looking the whole club behind the bar! It was awesome!! Josh was so cool and consistently checked up on us. I don't know why some of the other reviews say he's rude cause he was SO nice and accommodating. At one point he even brought my whole party a round of shots on the house! Our cocktail waitress Robyn was even more awesome! She was the best host I've ever had at a table. Anything I needed she was there and on point. We had another girl there too but I cant remember her name. She was just as great and helpful. They made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand. Oh and! we also had security at our table so randoms couldn't linger up in there. \n\nNeedless to say the night was awesome! I felt really well treated, the music was bumpin and my boyfriend had a GREAT time....success. I don't know why I don't do this every weekend?? It made me want to get a table every time I go there. \n\nThanks Firehouse!"
0,"Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back."
1,"Let me start off with: The music at this place is jamming! Old school music like Beegees and Richard Marx. BUT all in instrumental. Soothing, made me want to eat more.\n\nAnyways....\n\nBenjarong is a nice small and quiet neighborhood restaurant.  The staff there were all really friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. The menu offered several choices. We ended up choosing Crab Rangoons (I know, I should have went more THAI), green pork curry with extra eggplant, and chicken pad thai.\n\nThe crab rangoons were alright. I guess I should expect that since it is a thai restaurant.  Too much cream cheese, not enough crab.. And the cream cheese was still a bit firm. \n\nThe food came out pretty damn fast.. LIke lightning fast. I was like DAMN that's fast. Really, that's what I said in my head as I saw the food arriving.\n\nThe green curry was my favorite part. It had a nice kick but I wish the eggplant was cut bigger. It was thinly sliced so it was hard to really taste the flavor of the eggplant (which is my favorite part of green curry). But nonetheless, the sauce was delicious with white rice which comes with your order.\n\nThe pad thai was sweet. If you need a little kick, make sure to ask for the spice tray as there is none on the table. I liked the sweetness of it. A little bit different that most other pad thai that I had. The sauce was thicker than what I am use to but it was good. \n\nOverall, a nice place with nice people and nice food."
0,"This is a nice hotel, but all the extra fees are ridiculous. You think you're getting a good rate, but then with $12.99 a day for internet and $17 for parking, the rate is actually not that good at all. \n\nAnd the way they handle the internet within the hotel is terrible. I guess they are so worried about people stealing it (heaven forbid!) that you have to continually resign onto it throughout the day if you've been inactive on your computer for a few hours. (Even if you leave your laptop on and open in your room.) I was with a group that booked a meeting room, but don't expect internet to come with the room ... they'll tack on an exorbitant fee for that too. How is that I get free, excellent internet in a Motel 6 but not at a Sheraton?"
1,"We eat here for breakfast every time we are in Vegas. On our last trip (923/10 to 9/27/10) we decided we try another place closer to the strip and it only made us appreciate the Sourdough Cafe more! Our steaks are always cooked to order, the over easy eggs are NOT greasy and the coffee is good! \n\nWe usually just dine and dash but this time we were wonderfully surprised with a NO SMOKING room to play video poker! I was one happy girl with a cup of hot joe, video poker and smoke free air-all in one casino!"
1,Sample some wines before you commit to one and then stay the night munching and sipping.  Liked it a lot.  Very expensive.  Very trendy/hip.  Great people-watching.  Loud.  Disappointed with the pork belly after reading so many great things here.
0,"First off the pizza is FANTASTIC. that is if the waitresses ever come around and serve you.\n\nThe first time my husband and i went and had dinner before trivia. the waitress acted like it was a bother to wait on us. \n\nWe went several times after that and just got dessert or something small and it was no problem.\n\nThe last time (and it will be the last time) we had the pizza. It was fabulous, but I couldn't even tell the waitress that because the two of us had eaten the entire thing (i'd say at least 30 - 40 min) before we tracked her down and asked for drink refills and the check. we waited another 30 or so minutes and she brought it. (another 30 minutes went by) and finally she came over to table and said \""are you waiting for me\"" no joke. it was the worst. I felt bad leaving a tip, and that says alot. I mean i can see where the pizzas are and where the drink machine is. could have done it myself.\n\nI won't be back."
0,"Hmmm such a high stars I'm not sure why , flavor is bland sorry I love authentic or Americanized Thai food but this place I can't give more than 2 :( service is good but I'm rating on the food."
0,"Went in for lunch today and a very small crowd was in the restaurant.  Figured I would get some decent service.  The service wasn't bad, just the speed was a bit below what I would expect with less than 20 people in the place.\n\nAfter the longer than expected wait, I hoped to have a good meal.  The Mushroom Swiss Burger was very dry and lacked in any real flavor.  Made me think that this was probably a frozen/pre-made patty.\n\nMy wife had the chicken fingers/crispers/whatevers, and they too were very bland and lacked real flavor.  I never expect to put salt on anything in a restaurant as they typically are very high in sodium anyway but I think that Zipps could have used a little zip of salt on their entrees today.  I hope this isn't a regular occurrence there.\n\nI MAY give Zipp's one more chance and try something different, but the hamburger and chicken fingers will not be in my radar."
0,"It's great to have a diet menu.  The veggies were fresh and delicious, but the sauce was a little bland, watery and sweet.  If you are going to do diet, you have to use garlic, maybe some hot sauce to spice it up."
1,"If I could, I would give this place 4.5 stars. Allow me to explain....\n\nWe started my birthday dinner off with the tuna tartare and the calamari..  both were excellent apps.. one of my cousins had the Svedka vodka infused pineapple cocktail (the VIP... get it?!?) which I had a sip from and enjoyed a lot.\n\nOur sides for the dinner were the asparagus, potatoes au gratin, and the lobster mac and cheese.  All were good but the lobster mac and cheese stood out.. mostly b/c I love me some mac and cheese.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the 16 oz prime ribeye cooked medium. As per our server's recommendation, I cut into it to determine if the doneness was correct... I did and it was cooked perfectly, or so I tthought. As I started to cut off a piece for my tablemates to try the steak, it turned out to be a step below rare. \n\nI advised our server about the doneness of my steak and he apologized and he sent it back.  A few minutes later, another gentleman in a suit came up to me and apologized about the doneness of my steak.  When it came back, MY OH MY, best steak I've had all year.\n\nThe service throughout dinner was solid. Waters were promptly refilled.  When my beer was close to being empty I was asked if I wanted another. \n\nAs a postscript to my review, towards the end of the dinner, I filled out one of their mailing cards just for the hell of it. This week, I recived a hand written thank you card from our server thanking me and my party for having my birthday dinnner there.  That blew my mind away.\n\nSo, 4.5 stars out of 5. It would have been 5 but the 1/2 star deduction was because I had to send my steak back. But everything else was perfect.  Better than the other steakhouse I went to in Vegas earlier in the year."
1,"Update: I just had to give them 5 stars again!!! I've been here a lot since my first great experience and it has not let me down. The menu is not huge but they have the best bbq ribs and burgers around.  The bar and wait staff are awesome. It's definitely my favorite place in town for family dining, happy hour AND date night. I heard the breakfast is great too! This is a must try."
0,I do not recommend coming here for breakfast. The menu is over priced for terrible food. I had the scrambled eggs with bacon and wheat toast and my mother had the french toast. The food was luke warm to cold and wouldn't recommend either.
1,"I love Agent Provocateur, their items are high quality and extremely sexy.  I much prefer buying a few items here then wasting my money someplace like VS.\n\nI received great service at this location, the sales women were very helpful and nice.  They offered me water or champagne along with help with picking and trying on various items.  This past time I came in the women was a huge help with sizing.  Some of the bras are sized very differently, and I ended up taking a full cup size up in a piece I really liked.  Had I not had her assistance I would have walked away bummed, I didn't fit right into a particular piece.\n\n\nI will always come back to this location on my visits in the future."
1,The service was excellent. My butterfly pork chop was excellent. Everyone had a great time. Dinner table mates had spaghetti meatballs and they were excellent Great dinner service.
1,"If this place wasnt so pricey Id give them five stars. \n\nThe service here is excellent. \n\nDespite the small size of this store, i usually leave with everything i needed. \n\nI like the fact that they have open stock on items such as art stix. What this means is they sell each color individually so you dont have to buy the whole box when you only need a color or two. \n\nThey have ALL of your art needs, from painting & drawing supplies to mould making and printmaking supplies. \n\nNot the biggest store - theres a larger one on charleston - but itll do."
1,"Don't judge me.\n\nI must confess, I thought the cupcake rage was a fad that would fade quickly.  No, strike that; I WANTED the fad the fade quickly.  Most places I tried seemed too focused on making their frosting taste good and not enough on making the cupcake moist and tasty to stand in its own.  In fact, some places had more frosting than cupcake (*cough*Tammie Coe*cough*)!\n\nBring it back over a year ago and I walked into Caked to try their wares.  Frankly, I was not impressed.  It was ok, but Duncan Heins made better.  \n\nFlash forward to last week.  Coming out of Sushi Mon I was hungry for desert (AYCE just isn't the same anymore when it's not AYCE desert...but that's a discussion for another review).  Anyway, we strolled on over to Caked and I was only going to grab one cupcake (I need to watch my figure).  But the smell of sweet treats called to me and my eyes started to get bigger as I looked longingly into the display case.  EYES = O.O     stomach = o\n\nEach was $2.75:\n\n   Red Velvet (x2) - probably my least favorite.  The frosting was light and tasty, but the cupcake left me wanting a bit more flavor.  Not sure whether the frosting just outshone the cupcake or if the cupcake didn't have much flavor.  I'll be back to try again.  :)  \n\n   Carrot cake (x2) - Definitely my family's (and mine) favorite.  REALLY moist and tasty cake.  The frosting was just right: not too heavy and thick like most actual cakes have.  \n\n   DQ (x2) - Basically a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting, which is dipped in a chocolate shell like Dairy Queen (hence the name, duh).  Wasn't sure about this one because it seemed so plain, but it had sprinkles to please the kids so we got it.  This ended up being really flavorful.  The cupcake was really moist and chocolatey, but not so rich that you needed to wash every bite down with milk.  The frosting was a bit hard and too sweet for my tastebuds, but the fam didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n   Vanilla - hey, don't judge...it was a request by my daughter.  As usual, I didn't get a bite.  My girl ate it all up (frosting first, of course).\n\n   Mocha (x2) - my pick at the shop and one I will have to be back for.  Had a light, but distinct mocha flavor (duh, right?).  I could honestly do without the frosting because the cupcake could hold it's own.  \n\nAfter pigging out at Sushi Mon and stuffing our faces with cupcakes, we had one leftover DQ that sat in the fridge for 2 days.  Not sure if my wife was hiding it from me...  Anyway, upon discovery by me, I promptly ran to a dark corner of the house and ate it.  To my surprise, it was no less tasty or moist than on that first day.  If that's not a testament, I don't know what is.  I ordered 9, but if I had known the would keep well, I would have gotten a dozen.  \n\nI'm really glad I gave this shop another shot - my original judgement was premature.  Not only did it change my mind about the place, it changed my opinion of cupcakes, in general."
1,My parents....both of which are 92.....moved to WMV two years ago. They could not be more pleased.
0,"this place is absolute garbage.\ni have no idea what to expect out of LV strip clubs but, this place is a joke.\nif youre not the ugliest person on earth you are better off finding chics to entertain you elsewhere.\n\nby all means, if you *are* into braindead high school dropouts on possible drugs with fake breasts THEN this place is perfect for you (of course a generalization)\n\nhow this place still exists goes way over my head.\n\ndisclaimer:  my review is about Wednesday night\n\nthe parking lot looks packed. $22 cover per person (apparently they seem to offer free limo and admission?)\nsmall place is packed with people sitting around. few \""premier strippers\"" giving lapdances in full view of everyone else. security walking around. usually have table minimums of $400 from what i understand. drinks are $9 red bulls $9 coronas and up. hell with the overpriced drinks - this is vegas after all. \n\nok, now the best part: i would hardly call what the girls on stage are doing \""dancing\"". sometimes a girl on the side stage just stands there. there is no actual entertainment a person who hasn't drank 10 shots could possibly get out of them. a girl will come up to you every 15-30 minutes and offer to give you a lap dance. these dances cost anywhere from $10 a song to $20 a song. sometimes a girl has the nerve to demand tips on top of that. it's all only topless so you are paying crazy money to see women's breasts.\n\nif somehow you get dragged into their \""vip\"" area some kind of magical shit goes on in the back there for 400/500 an hour. $100 for quick fun? who freaking knows i think the girls make up whatever shit they want to.\n\nquick summary: if you get drunk there you are screwed. your wallet will be empty and if you happen to use a credit card i'm sure when you wake up the bill would be close to $5000. if you are not wasted you're overpaying for the night's entertainment to see breasts (possibly more).\n\nfor all those people who would think i'm just \""cheap\"" or don't understand the \""vegas culture\"" or something i tell you.. with the amount of money wasted at this joint you are better off having 5 escorts in your room. it'll prob wind up costing the same anyways. alternatively, you can get a pretty girl to massage you naked for 24 hrs.\n\nps: portland strip clubs are 2x - 10x better"
0,"Horrible! We were excited to eat here because of the name. However, the hot dogs were dried out and disgusting, buns were dry, and there are no refills on soda. I would suggest walking a couple of doors down to the burger joint."
0,"Horrible!!! I ordered the gyro, the meat was  frozen strips of who knows what! I took one bite and  had to spit it out. The owner took my order and said 10 minutes but it was more like 30. The owner and his wife appeared to be having a heated argument while he was cooking. I wish I could say something positive about the place, but there really isn't anything."
0,"I left with a baaaaad taste in my mouth and it had nothing to do with the tea.  The tea itself was very tasty - but because of the sales push, I never want to set foot in that store again.\n\nIt was the tea store equivalent of a car dealership.  Every step of the way was a battle against the sales pitch.  All I wanted to do was buy some tea.  Yet, I found myself having to say no repeatedly, deal with the salesperson's manipulative speech and attitude because I didn't do what she wanted...it was very unpleasant and annoying.  I was so put off by it, that had I not already promised my daughter that we would get the tea, I would have just said \""Forget it!\"" and left.\n\nI see that you can buy online but you know what?  I don't even want to do that now.  I don't want to buy anything from them because that just supports their nasty, manipulative approach."
1,"Thrift Shop Two is a hidden gem. This is where a lot of the non-clothing items donated to the Birthlink Thrift Shop round the corner end up, and the shelves are full or random bric-a-brac, household textiles, electronics, records, CDs, DVDs, games, books, and one of the best collections of VHS I've seen in a charity shop in a long time. The staff are always really friendly and helpful, and it's always got something interesting in there if you fancy a rake around!"
0,"It is a sports bar with reasonable charges for food and drink. The food however is your typical bar food and nothing seems all too fresh. I had the turkey burger and my hubby had a chicken sandwich. Both tasted like they had come from the freezer and thrown on a grill. The tater tots tasted like they had been over fried, refried or the oil needed to be changed. I think the kitchen cuts corners which is a real shame because I like the atmosphere there."
0,"We had a Groupon for this. Still feel we overpaid. Rather boring, not scary. Though some of the props were way cool, the actors were terrible. Not to mention the whole thing lasts roughly 17 minutes. Meh, I wouldn't go back. Can't believe they actually have annual passes for this. Why???? I think this place will close fairly soon."
1,More places should have an Ice covered bar top!  I love this place and I am getting a little old for Rum Jungle.\n\nI am starting to look like that statue as well.
1,"deeeeeeeelicious coffee.  lux taught me the difference between good coffee and great coffee, and for this i am eternally grateful.\n\nthis is definitely the best coffeeshop amongst the many that orbit downtown to get some solo work done.  the furniture isn't really set up in a way that's conducive to conversation, and i've never seen strangers meet here.\n\nfor that reason, it's not really a good place to have a work meeting, for example - the tables and couches are almost always occupied enough that you can't gather more than two or three people without being separated.\n\nthis changes when the weather isn't blistering - they have a great patio with more group seating."
1,"I was expecting something out of Austin Powers but felt like I could have been at a bar at a beach in San Diego.  I was there on a Friday night and it was busy but not butts to nuts like you'd find at a place on the strip.  The beer is a little pricey.  $5.50 for a Newcastle, but this is Vegas.\n\nParking is a little cramped but I got lucky and got a good spot just as another guy pulled out.  They had a dj playing songs off an apple laptop and he was playing a good mix of stuff.  Made me feel like I was back in college when he put on Crazytown.  When you're here, check out the upstairs area where you can kick back with some pool.  Another interesting note about the Crown and Anchor is the it's the hangout of choice for boxer Ricky Hatton when he fights in Vegas."
1,"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch meeting here last week with a great view of the famous aquarium. While we were eating the aquarium was being cleaned by professional divers and the experience was surreal. I had the watermelon/feta salad and the blackened flounder with asparagus, and walked out in that sweet zone between hungry and stuffed, also known as 'just right'. Service was excellent as well."
1,"I had the Andy's chicken! Crazy huge portion! Amazing presentation! My hubby had the chorizo hash....he said it was ok. He ate half of mine. Had a yummy butterscotch espresso, yum! Oj was fresh and yummy! A Vegas must go to breakfast place! Then go walk 5 miles! Totally worth it though. Service was good. I think I'll venture to the San Diego location with my family this summer! We got there at about 10:15 on a Sunday and got seated right away. When we left the wait was insane!"
0,"I have always been a BIG fan of Sushi Kee. When I found out they bought out Zushi, I was thrilled!! As I live about 2 minutes away from Zushi. Boy, was I, and continue to be disappointed. Here are just a few examples of why I'm not too fond of Zushi.\n\nFirst, my friend and I went there a few weekends ago and we are both pregnant. I usually get the Apache Roll, under different circumstances. The Apache roll is basically a California roll with spicy mayo on top, white fish on top and baked. So, I asked if they could make me a California roll, but put the spicy mayo on top and bake it for me. Keep in mind, Sushi Kee does this for me EVERY TIME I GO. The waiter told me they couldn't do that but they could substitute the fish. So, I ok'd and just asked to put shrimp on top instead. Well, 20 minutes later, he comes out with two California rolls, the way I requested, but with NO fish on top what so ever. Mind you, I asked for ONE regular California roll and ONE Apache style. It bothered me that he didn't even come out and tell me that they weren't going to substitute the fish AND the fact that he didn't check my order. So, I got charged FULL price for 2 Apache rolls. When, in fact, they were not Apache rolls. When confronted about it he said, \""well, we would have to charge you 3$ anyway for the spicy mayo and to bake it so i figured I would just charge you the full price for the Apache.\"" How does this make sense? A California roll is 4$ maybe 5$? and an Apache is almost 10$. ANYWAY, he did not care what so ever. Oh and when we were bone dry on our drinks, we look over, and he's sitting at the end of the bar just watching some TV. It took him a good 7 minutes to come back to the table to check on us. Needless to say, I have never tipped that horrible, EVER.\n\nA different friend of mine and I decided to go again. We both live so close so it's convenient. The waitress was wearing this TINY little skirt. Literally, you could see things when she walked away from the table. About the service she gave, it was way better than anyone else working there! Touche to her! However, the food ... eh okay. Now when I go to Zushi I don't EVER ask for any type of specialty rolls because they have made it clear, they don't understand. My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken for her son and the teriyaki sauce was absolutely HORRIBLE. The chicken was decent but looked a little weird. The only thing that really saved this sushi date, was the server, she was one of the best we've had since I started going there!\n\nAll in all, I think their food is pretty good. IF you go to Zushi and find a good server, stick with that one. The service there is just absolutely horrid. If they fired there entire staff and restocked up on some people who actually enjoy their jobs, somewhat, I would go there more often. BUT I think I'll stay with SUSHI KEE!!!"
1,"So we found this little treasure off of South Blvd, based solely on the awesome Yelp reviews. \n\nWe walked in and were greeted and seated right away. Chips and salsa were presented immediately and then we got our menus. I loved the menu...there were tons of pages and options...anything you could possibly want chicken, seafood, beef, steak and great  pictures under most all the dishes so you can see exactly what you will be getting which made me as a hungry and confused first timer very happy! \n\nAfter some questions and review of the menu we finally ordered I opted for the lunch special, burritos and cream sauce. \n\nOkay, first things first,I agree with the previous review portion size here is here is out of control!!! There were so many plates always coming out the kitchen loaded with tons of great food! I couldn't wait to get mine and I was not disappointed!\n\nWhen my burritos arrived all I could get out was OMG! They were huge! Packed with delicious shredded chicken and rice... My favorite part of the dish was the sauce. It was so flavorful and had a very nice kick, but if you want to kick it up make sure to ask for some of the hot sauce from the kitchen, it's so freaking good! \n\nNeedless to say we both left stuffed and happy! This is a great place for some Mexican grub and I look forward to going back!"
1,"Oh my goodness where do I start....I hadn't had my hair cut in a YEAR I was terribly nervous from past REALLY bad hair cuts but then I found Salon Faith I felt so welcomed and cared about. I was so overwhelmed being a small town girl new to Scottsdale trying to find a salon but this place is amazing! The time and care they put in your hair is astounding! Mary Beth walked me thru everything she was doing explaining why she was doing it and what it would look like after she cut it...just amazing ... All the stylists are SO knowledgable about EVERYTHING and very professional and caring... And their prices are REALLY decent for being in Scottsdale.., my only VERY VERY VERY small complaint would be the products they use are pretty spendy... I'd love to own them BUT on a stay at home mom budget not happening...."
0,"Have to say I was not impressed. The service was simply ok and we had a variety of the menu options but nothing was more than mediocre.  Simple Alfredo with little spunk, the garlic chicken spaghetti had no garlic flavor but I will say the chicken was well cooked and tasty. The green chile pizza has no green chile but rather they tried to pass green bell pepper off as green chile. Very disappointed."
1,Very decent veggie burger option which consists of grilled vege pate. Great soda selection (including black cherry). Really like the sweet potato and regular potato mix option. Lots of original condiments as well as burger toppings and cheeses. The cost can add up really quick with the added toppings but the variety is fantastic. Was not incredibly impressed with their poutine. Way better vegetarian poutine options in this neighborhood. \n\nHave been accidentally served a meat burger before when I ordered a veggie burger so check your veggie burger before you take a bite. \n\nOpen very late- Have been here at midnight and I think I've seen them open as late as 1am.
1,"Delicious home made authentic italian classics.  Low prices.  Extremely generous portions.  For the same price as a Jimmy John's sandwich or Moe's Burrito, you can have a expertly prepared Italian feast with all fresh ingredients.\n\nWhy not a 5?  The service can be slow during the lunch rush, and the interior is a bit run down.  If you aren't in a crazy rush, your money won't go farther for better food anywhere in Market Square."
1,Food was good. Staff was friendly. Wasn't sure what Shwarma was when I walked in but I found out it's kind of like a Gyro with slightly different toppings. I would eat here again.
1,Great food. The spinach salad is great. Price is a little on the high side.
0,"This store has gotten better.  I am sometimes tempted to head over to Home Depot, but in general this store is OK.\n\nNow, as far as why I gave them only two stars, here is where they really really drop the ball.  They do not have an actual cashier in the evenings.  They only have those self service machines which is four machines managed by 1 cashier.  I get it Lowes, you make MORE $$ when you give less service.  (At least that is what YOU think).  Here is how it is actually gonna play out...I am not a fan of self service.  So I won't be using your self checkout.  If you cannot ring me up, you will NOT ring me up.  Get the idea here??"
1,"Came here my very first night in Madison and returned many more times -- mostly to drink (good selection of local beers on tap), but the food is excellent. Try the veggie chili with cornbread for something different. Plenty of decent-sized tables if you're with a big group but you're gonna wait a goodly while for one on weekends."
1,"Small, medium, and large are definitely American-sized portions (9\"", 12\"", and 20\"", respectively). I had a small over the course of two meals. The large looked intimidating as the guys behind the counter were wrapping one up for a delivery order.\n\nWe visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had.\n\nEach sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette.\n\nThe verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10."
1,"One of my favorite fast food places, they always have good food (never had a sub-par meal).  Employees are always friendly, and the restaurant has always been clean.   They did however forget to give me napkins in the drive thru **a need when trying to eat in your car, so that is the reason for the star drop"
0,"Went to this place in the Rio (not the one on Spring Mountain) for dinner. Pricing was high, but food was good tasting. Service kinda sucked though. Pretty much was ignored. Difficult to get drink refills. It was not the stereotypical \""rude\"" wait staff, it was plain being ignored. I would give 4 stars for food quality itself, but price/value and being ignored gets a significant knockdown in my book. Think I'll go back to the original KJ on SpringMountain."
1,"We hit up Triple George prior to Shrek at the Smith's Center and the hype is true, this place is great! They offered a three course meal themed around Shrek which my girlfriend got and really enjoyed particularly the goat cheese salad. I had been craving fish and chips and was thrilled at how delicious they are given we are in a desert. My last experience with fish and chips was in Ireland and these certainly stood up to those delicious treats. For dessert I went with the creme brulee which was a perfect consistency and I would order that again for sure. The waitress was prompt and made sure we got out with plenty of time to get to our show. \nThe only draw back to this location is that it is valet only and not a very large valet so if you aren't doing an early dinner you might want to park at one of the surrounding hotels."
1,"It may not be the best casino & hotel to stay in Vegas, but at $37 and some change per night, it's amazing. Considering I paid 59.99 for crappy Days inn... I am going here again, and again and again.... and may be one of these times, I'd hide from my wife and goto the Pool :-) or watch Bite with her or even go on the rides.\n\nAnd you also get unlimited free rides on the tower."
1,"I come to Courier Cafe pretty regularly.  Their burger options are a good bargain.  I've always enjoyed their shakes- especially the strawberry or peanut butter.  I prefer to get the specials because I go there so often.  I had a delicious fish fillet sandwich with a HUGE fillet.  Then I got it again, and it was pretty small.  I noticed that sometimes the food isn't very consistent.  \n\nThe one thing that might surprise you is that their salad bar is AMAZING.  I get a huge salad with everything on it.  Like a pound of salad for $5.00.  Leaves are pretty light, so a pound a salad is prettty huge."
0,This restaurant was my favorite place to go but that has now changed and apparently the new ownership must have something to do with it. I stopped today to have breakfast and left very upset. The orange juice was bad. I waited over an hour to get my food and when it arrived it was cold. The bathroom was filthy. The waitress was nice. A lot of improvement needs to be done before I will come back. There are plenty of other places out there that are doing things right.
0,If I could give this place a zero I would. All I wanted was a simple acrylic nail removal & my nail tech did not even deliver that. My nails were left jagged & she didn't even remove all of the acrylic. The atmosphere is dirty & dated. Everything about this place needs an upgrade.
0,"I'm in Vegas for a month and picked up a menu from here. The place was a bit dirty but gave it a try anyway. I understand pizzas are greasy, but this pizza was extremely greasy, very sloppy pizza. I doubt I'll order from here again. The only good thing is that they're open 24 hours."
0,"I came here on Valentine's day. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was less than romantic. We were elbow to elbow with another couple. They crammed in as many two tops as possible, and doubled the prices on their menu, in honor of this day of love. It was obvious their only concern was gaining as much revenue as possible, at the expense of their guests. \n\nThe food was awful. I feel bad saying that, but it is the best description. I had the veal. It tasted like a microwave dinner. The noodles were over cooked and mushy. How does that happen at an Italian restaurant? As a cook, I expect better, especially when I'm paying through the nose. I didn't come out on Valentine's day to rub elbows with somebody that I don't know. Horrible experience, will never visit again."
0,"I haven't had dim sum in a while so my husband and I came here to satisfy my long-awaited dim sum craving. We went on a Sunday before noon. No wait. First impression - I like that the restaurant feels inviting. One spacious, modern, open room, not a hole in the wall.\n\nTo my dismay, my feelings changed as soon as I tried some of the dishes. The food was disappointing. I regretted my craving choice. Most of the things we ordered were cold or just awful. The worst one was the beef spare ribs. So greasy, fatty, gummy, and boney. My shrimp wontons were cold. Chow fun were short pieces and dry, just the opposite of how I like them. Those ribs left a horrible taste in my mouth the whole day. The only thing that were decent were the shu mai and the shrimp flat rice noodle.\n\nOther saving graces were the decor, no wait, and the excellent service even though I'm not Chinese. The dim sum ladies were nice, explained what some of the items are, the server checked up on us, etc. \n\nOur bill was $38 for two before tip."
1,"I love Chodang!!!  Craving it now just writing this review. \n\nI go there regularly, and have also gotten take out a few times as well.  I usually go with the dol sot bibimbop, which I love.  It's authentic (well, at least to me, but I'm not Korean), and comes in the hot bowl with the raw egg.  Yum!!!  Also gotten the bibimbop take out and the portions are very generous.  I feel like with the take out, I end up with 2 full meals, but eating in, I end up with 1.5 meals.\n\nI LOVE their sides as well.  So good!  And they include several with the takeout as well.\n\nThis restaurant is always consistent, and the food always comes out very fast.  It can get busy, but it's worth it.\n\nAs for the lack of the personal grills, I actually think that's a bonus here!  Yes, it's fun to cook your own food, but then you smell like it and have to wash your hair and clothes.  At Chodang, you dont' have to take your coat to the dry cleaners after eating there.  It's nice to be a place that's not smoky, and is clean and free of lingering smells."
0,Be very careful about using this Pharmacy here as they don't care if they send you home with the wrong prescription. I contacted them after checking with my Dr to be sure what was sent them but they refused to correct it or give me credit for it. Said OH well you paid for it! Who ever filled it can't even spell correctly. Really sad as this could be dangerous in the wrong hands. I liked to see their faces when the Pharmacy Board Contacts them!
1,"A fine little music venue, though word has it that it's closed now. The guy who books and promotes for the place is real super cool, the bar has a decnt beer selection, the live sound is great, and the stage is pretty cool too.  Oh, and you can gamble on poker machines and whatnot if you wish.  Sorta off the beaten path, but good place to see a show.\n\nUPDATE:  It's closed.  :("
0,"Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."
1,"From the previous review I thought I was just getting a foot massage with a head, neck, and shoulder massage. Instead I got a complete massage from head to toe. Though it was one of the best massages I've ever had, she only spent about  5-10 out of 60 minutes on my feet. I had just had a regular massage the day before and had aching feet from going out dancing the night before, so I was primarily there to get my feet worked on. If she had even spent another 5 minutes on my feet it would have been a 5 star review. Still it was an amazing massage and I left feeling totally relaxed and fairly blissful. The recliner chairs are extremely comfortable. She changed the back on the chair and had me flip over, the new back had a face hole in it like a regular massage table, but it was infinitely more comfortable than a standard massage table. The dim lightly, pleasant decor, and soft music all added to putting me into a relaxed state. Next time I'm going for the 90 minute massage so there's plenty of time for the feet and everything else."
1,Food was good as always. It was pretty busy all the available tables were dirty. Let manager know he cleaned a table for us right away. Then our food took longer than it should have to get out. I am giving 4 stars because even though there was issues the manager recognized it without us complaining and gave us free entree certificates and was very apologetic.
0,"Worst meal I've had in 10 years.  Let's take a walk down Disaster Ave...\n\n1. We got pushed to the \""lounge\"" for 20 minutes before being seated despite mulitple open tables, just like another reviewer.  $14 cocktails...rediculous.\n\n2. On the way to our table, the hostess blurts out \""Ooops!\"" and pulls a 180 right into the glass of red wine I was holding...all over my white shirt.  \""I'm sorry...totally my fault\"" she said and sat us down...while handing me the bar tab.  It's $96 for 5 vodka sodas and a glass of wine.  I'm about ready to punch someone.  \""Can I do anything for that\"" she asks.  \""How about taking care of this bar tab\"" I replied.  We never saw her again.\n\n3.  The one positive experience was the waiter.  Very energetic and went out of his way to help clean my shirt, although it was a lost cause.\n\n4.  Now the menu...the most overpriced menu I've ever seen.  I was at Mastro's 2 nights before and this joke of a restaurant was about 20% MORE expensive than a well respected steakhouse (which was great, by the way, and about a 90 second walk from Beso's entrance...hint, hint.)\n\n5.  There were 7 of us and they were out of 3 people's first choice of entree.  Really?  At 10:00 on the Friday of a huge fight weekend (Mayweather vs Mosley) they ran out of not 1 but at least 3 entrees?  How is that possible?  Incompetence, as many here have noted.\n\n6. We order, and we wait...and wait...and wait.  Appetizers come.  No comment, almost forgot about them when trying to remember the night's events.  Entrees arrive...take a look at the photo to see what a $36 pork chop looks like (if I can figure out how to do that on Yelp...I signed up for the sole purpose of warning people about this place).  And consistent with other reviews, it was liberally salted.\n\n7.  By now I'm wondering when the manager is going to come over to appologize for the wine incident, but pretty certain he's not coming and would venture to guess that he didn't even know about it.\n\n8.  We all pass on desert and get out of there in about 2 hours.\n\nThis place is a bar that serves food, and nothing more.  It is insanely expensive and the food really isn't any good.  The waiter was competent and a good guy, but the hostess ruining my shirt and doing nothing about it is unacceptable at a place this expensive.  I considered having a conversation with the manager before leaving, but I would rather not help this place survive...it needs to die, quickly, before anyone else wastes their money."
1,"Love this place! Unique little sandwiches with quality ingredients! The best service, not the kind where they pester you, but the kind where they ask if you're enjoying your food and if you've been there before. I like this spot when I'm in uptown Phoenix."
1,Food is great been here three times and tried something different everytime haven't been disappointed. Service is great and food is fresh.
1,"Amazing food with more than just pizza!  I work close so my coworkers and I are in quite often.  Tyler the owner/chef takes pride in his work.  Other than pizza, bistro has wings, tenders, salads, meatball and garlic Parmesan sliders, and much more!  I haven't tried everything on the menu but I'm sure ill get there soon.  Haven't had anything from here that I haven't been a fan of! \n\n5 stars!!!"
1,"The customer service here is top notch.   Both the cashier and customer service desk were very helpful with exchanging my pants that I bought (too big) on the website.   Also,  found a clearance shirt for $4,  and while I was in line paying,  some nice lady gave me her leftover $4.06 in kohl's cash! Free shirt??!! Can my day get any better?"
0,Horrible costumer service. Didn't even want to be bothered. Was rude and ignored me. Also very small store and not enough employees working. I was left holding my baby in her car seat for ever until i got help.
1,"I looooove this place! I drive all the way from Weddington to eat here all the time! I purposely over order so I can take food home.  Meatball rolls are heaven! As are the summer, spring, and pork rolls!  I order the Pho with the meat raw on the side.  The staff is soooo awesome! I barely have to order, they always remember what I like! Cant get enough of this place, all my friends are hooked."
0,"Made a reservation using Open Table 4 days in advance of my birthday only to get a phone call hours before telling me there are no teppanyaki tables available & that Open Table isn't a good method of reservations for their restaurant. Well, then don't have it as your reservation tool on your website! Or, you could have at least called with a little more advance notice so that we could make alternate plans when you know this to be an issue."
0,"I am giving a generous 2 stars only because I had a good experience last year.   \n\nFirst, I am not a bike novice, but to these douche bags, everyone else is.  I may not have the highest end bikes, but I do own a $3500 a trek carbon road bike and a $4k specialized stumpjumper.  I have been riding bikes for 35 years, so I do know the difference between a juicy and a hayes.  \n\nSo for my experience this year, I rented the same bike I rented a year ago, but my experience was night and day.  Last year, everything was great, from service to the bike itself.  But this year, I called ahead and asked for  availability.  Kyle took my info, but never called me back.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I stopped in after getting into phx, and was pleased to get the bike, but unfortunately, they did a 5 minute check over of the bike.  On the trail, the worse of the worse experience.  Front brake dragged and rear was weak, a dangerous combination, at best.\n\nI took it back, and while they did fix it, they seem to assume I must have done damage to the bike.  Anyway, upon returning the bike, they were real knobs about a scratch on the seat post and then the guy told me it was his personal bike.  I told him if you rent out a mountain bike, for mountain biking, you might expect a scratch or two.  \n\nHe didn't like that.   I explained that he shouldn't rent his bike out then."
1,"I'm Taiwanese and to say the least, probably one of the more accurate TW food in the valley thus far.\n\nI've always been on a hunt for decent beef noodle soup in AZ and today I might have found one. The broth was similar to Sichuan beef noodle soup (which I liked because of the slight spiciness and the taste of chili bean sauce). They probably also added star anise () in there so it tasted more like simmered beef but tasty. The beef chunks were a little bit thin in size, but were tender. However, the noodles, although were widened (which I preferred), were a little overcooked. It was kinda soggy. This was my first time eating here so I do not know if they consistently cook this way, but I would just buy it to go and buy noodles at MeKong plaza and cook myself some decent noodles to eat with its decent beef broth. Overall, pretty impressed with the broth.\n\nMy friends had pork chop rice plate and Tainan DanZai noodles. The pork chop  was decent looking and came in good portion (compare to Taiwan food express). DanZai noodles was small in portion and tasted a little bland (though that's how it should be).\n\nI would say their food is not perfect to the standard of authentic Taiwanese food, but it's definitely your go-to place if you are craving for some Taiwanese food. There are typical Taiwanese small dishes () also.\n\n\nIt's worth a try if you haven't had Taiwanese food for a long time being in the desert."
1,"Visites last night and it was superb.  Best sushi, great food and great personnel including all.  I'll come back next time I visit Montreal."
0,"My friend and I used to come here after class to grab a quick lunch to eat. Anyways the lunch menu is around $8-12 depending what choices you get.  The portions were good enough but it was short of amazing.  Personally, I liked the pasta it was descent.  I wouldnt mind going back here again, I thought. \n\nWe came back again to RMG again during lunch and came back to a horrible experience.  We were seated near the bar area and it took like 15minutes for someone to finally realize we were there and when the server took our orders. It was about 25-30minutes till we got our food and it was cold when it arrived.  We ended up not finishing the food and waited for the server to come back.\n\nHe asked how everything was and we let him know that the food was cold and the service was not great.  He comped our meal and we left.  From then, I knew I wouldnt come back here again.  \n\nHowever, about a week ago I went back to have lunch there again since it has been almost a year since I havent gone back to RMG and it finally concluded the fact why I wouldnt want to come back here again. \n\nThe complimentary bread was hard and not tasteful.  We ordered the $2 entrees for $25 ( two appetizers and two entrees) we ordered the mac & cheese bites some other appetizer. Both appetizers tasted bland and it seemed like it was just microwaved.  The entrees were average, its only good if youre hungry but other than that, go somewhere else to fill your appetite for italian food."
1,Service and food was impeccable. I'm very impressed to say the least. I'll be coming back and Bringing my friends. From the paella to the flan it was amazing. Every bite I tasted was on point. I'm very impressed.
1,Love the people and staff. Equipment works great for people serious about working out. Favorite!
0,"I travel often and like to stay at Delta Hotel's because of their commitment to customer service. Im fact, I am a \""Gold\"" member of their loyalty program. However, this location has proven to be an exception. Sub-par service. The elevators were broken during my entire visit. The facilities are dated. The bathrooms are tiny. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. There are lots of options for hotels in downtown Montreal - I recommend you stay somewhere else."
1,"This review is pretty much just for the frozen hot chocolate I tried and all the delicious looking food around me as I ate it.  I had the peanut butter one and as a peanut butter fanatic it was soooo good!\nI also tried their walk up ordering outside and I was less than impressed with everything there.  If you go, go inside and order a frozen hot chocolate!  It is a bit pricey though"
0,"Never coming here again!  Food was just ok, service threw me off!  Called in my order, they told me it'll be ready in 5-10mins. Got to the place about 10mins and it wasn't busy. Service lady ask for my phone number, she stated it's almost done about 5 more mins. My husband and I were waiting for a good 15mins watching other customers get their food before us when they ordered after we arrived. So we asked what happened to our food and the service lady said it's been ready and waiting for at least 5mins. We stated how come you never called us and she stated coz we haven't paid!  Lady!!!! We checked in with you and was waiting for our food to be serviced and rendered!  Wtheck!  I didn't have the heart to leave mainly because I was starving and been waiting for my food that I phone ordered and had to wait for at least 15-20mins extra!  Disappointment is what my husband and I experienced from this place!  Bad bad bad. \nTo top it off the restaurant's whole family came in and it was just a mess. One came in started messing(preparing)with the vegetable that they use to cook, mind you, I do not think she washed her hands!  Eww gross!"
0,"So extremely disappointed. My mother booked two nights at the Stratosphere for a much needed couples week-end with my husband. She used Expedia. Cus we Expedia the Stratosphere kept telling us we booked with a third party and to work details out with them. Expedia said to call hotel and request room type and preferences. When I did I was told hotel did not have our reservation from Expedia yet and call back day before.  When I called a day before I was told rudely we were in the \""old un remodeled part of the tower in two queen bed and it was to late to make changes\"". Once we got there we did get one queen bed but very far from the pool and with a horrible view of the rooftop of another building and depressing North Las Vegas. We ate diner at Mac gross -the most pathetic attempt at a steak house. Gross. The pool closes at 7. There is only ONE POOL and it's full of kids in clothes. Sunday we slept in. Skipped brunch an decided to have dinner in the tower at 11:00pm. Everything was closed (with exception of the diner) club 107 had only 4 appetizers available out of the entire menu. None appetizing. By the way... We had to pay $15  per person per day to. Use the facilities as a guest of the hotel! WTF?! That was $90 extra for a gross kid filled jacuzzi and a pool that closed at 7! A restaurant that closed too early to enjoy and a stinky old room with a debtor easing view. No wonder 7 people have committed suicide here! We should have stayed in Laughlin!"
0,"I read reviews for movies, restaurants and products all the time. How did I forget to read the reviews before dropping $200 on this show I don't know. I've always wanted to see it. I heard they changed it after a performer died, but I still thought it would be good. I was wrong. I wish I had seen it years ago before they changed it. We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked? I didn't have an answer, as I was wondering the same thing. Go see Mystere or O at Bellagio if you want a Cirque de Soleil show, chances are you'll be disappointed with this one."
0,"Now I know why this was featured on every travel site about Pittsburgh. It's what is known in the trade as \""tourist trap.\"" Surely Pittsburgh could have come up with a more original way to showcase its riverfront and the Clinton Furnace than importing Chicago's chains: Joe's Crab Shack, Bar Louie, Houlihan's. The only local restaurants were, unfortunately, closed during our visit, so we were forced to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe. What could we do? There was nothing around for at least a mile after we took the inclines. My children enjoyed the fountain, but I couldn't wait to leave."
1,Super good food and staff it's extremely friendly. Love coming here every time I'm in the area.
1,"If you're looking for something super greasy, the brunch here is for you. Located on the Capitol square in Madison, Dlux is situated in a great location. My friends and I came here for their highly reputed \""bottomless mimosa\"" brunch on a Saturday morning, and there were some nice parts of the experience and some less nice parts. \n\nI'll start with the letdowns. Coming here on a Saturday morning, I expected the atmosphere to be calm and relaxing. It felt like a club, with the latest pop/electronic hits playing in the background. Also, someone had recommended the parmesan cream truffle fries, but they did not live up to my expectations. Over a span of 15-20 minutes, the cream sauce on the fries congealed in a non-appetizing fashion. \n\nOther than those two things though, I enjoyed Dlux. The donut balls are great. The strawberry cream sauce that accompanied them was super tasty and complemented the indulgent fried dough balls. I got the spicy sausage breakfast sandwich, and the sriracha mayo sauce made the sandwich incredible. I would also recommend getting the sweet potato fries with the aforementioned sriracha mayo dip. I'm a little biased because I love sweet potato fries, but they're worth it.\n\nThe espresso milkshake was also great. Espresso grinds mixed in with ice cream. Simple and delicious. I didn't have the bottomless mimosas, but they're exactly what I expected: a little diluted but decent.\n\nOverall, Dlux was a great place to dine with reasonable prices. Make sure to come before the brunch rush though."
1,The chicken tikka masala is a great favorite.  My two kids (ages 4 and 7) eat it like it's ice cream. \nThe restaurant was hopping...a great new Indian restaurant on the west side.
1,"Well its simple, food is great ,price is good and me and my family and friends have been coming here for years!"
0,"I moved out here from Chicago about 7 months ago and some friends of mine that live in my apartment complex told me to check out this bar.  It is what it is.  It's a freaking dive bar that smells like farts.  For anyone familiar with the Chicagoland area, it reminded me a bit like Bridgeport.  That same peanuts and nasty fart smell that occupies stank ass Bridgeport and Stickney.  Needless to say, I love sports but hate dive bars.  There's no disguises here.  If you're looking for a dive bar/a place just to stop off and grab a beer without looking your best, come here."
1,"Diane and her staff did an AMAZING job catering our son's wedding rehearsal dinner at Encanto Park Clubhouse !  Our guest loved La Canasta's Fiesta Buffet from the catering menu, it had a little bit of everything. The evening would not have been a success without them.  Thank you thank you thank you La Canasta Capitolio !"
1,"Easily my favorite place for ice cream in Las Vegas. Yes, it's in downtown. Yes, it's located inside the Cal. I love the Cal for the food, the ice cream and for the old Vegas feel with a Hawaiian twist it provides.\n\nThe ice cream flavor that reigns supreme in my mind is the caramel coconut macadamia nut. It's so perfectly good. Rich in flavor, rich in butterfat... Just the way ice cream should be. The combination of flavors is just so right.\n\nThe coconut pineapple I tried on my last trip to Vegas was good, too. But the caramel coco mac is still at the top of my list.\n\nCan't wait to go back."
1,Beautiful as ever!
0,"A good friend of mine wanted to take me for a new experience before we were to attend a party in Scottsdale. We were asked to leave because we were not wearing \""proper attire.\""  I questioned the manager what was the dress code and he could not answer me nor was it posted on the front door, but this site says \""casual\"" so I guess costumes don't count as casual but clearly there was no reason to seat us, take our drink order, and then ask us to leave.  I think Bandera has poor customer service since they didn't seem to try and find accommodations!"
0,"I am only giving this place a one star rating because I have to give something. I would actually give this place zero stars. One time I went in there to sell some books. A library book accidentally got placed in the pile of books to sell. I did not realize it and neither did the employee until later that night. Instead of calling me, the bookstore called the library and told them I was trying to sell their books. The library actually tried to press charges on me for this. I did not know that anything was even going on until a police officer showed up at my door and inquired about the incident. I told him I had no idea there was a problem because the bookstore never called me. \n I went up to the bookstore to clear it up and to let them know it was just a mistake. I never meant to try and sell a library book. The manager of the bookstore, I think her name was Denise ( a skinny redhead) came up to me and asked me to sign a paper. When I asked her what it was, she told me that it was a form that explained if I ever came back on the bookstores property, I would be arrested for trespassing....WHAT?? It was an innocent mistake. I would never try and sell books that were not mine. I also am banned from the library because they apparently believed the story that the bookstore told them. I tried to talk with the head librarian and she wanted to know why it took me so long to come see her if it was all an accident. I tried to explain to her that the bookstore never called me to inform me of the mix up. I did not know about it for weeks afterwards when a police officer came to my house.\n If you are going to sell books to this store, please check and double check that the books are yours to sell. This place apparently believes accidents to do not happen. I have warned all my friends and family about this place and nobody I know will shop there again."
1,"Downstairs...long communal tables, paper tablecloths...who would guess that upstairs is this gem of a bar, with the same wonderful barbecue, better service, and a nice classy modern vibe?\n\nThe food is excellent, I mean...Kevin Souza, barbecue, the best fried chicken in the city....what more could you ask for?  The bar is great...very friendly and VERY knowledgeable bartenders, good beers, and a whiskey list which, while it is far from the longest in the city, might be the most interesting. (High West Campfire...you can thank me later)...I mean, where else will you find French whiskey? Indian whiskey?  English whiskey?\n\nThey are now hosting comedy shows certain evenings...find out when the next one is, you won't be sorry.\n\nGive this place a try...you'll like it."
1,"Adult pool day time, party club at night!! What more can I say.\n\nNice pools, waterfalls, lots of hanging out areas, nice bar, usual prices, the bartenders do fancy tricks like in Cocktail, live DJ music. The best part, no kiddies running around splashing you, just a bunch of adults."
0,Oh my goodness!  Employees are so grumpy!\n\nWe tried to go through the drive through to get our free satisfries. We were told we could only get one order per car do we had to park and go inside.  Kind of ridiculous. \n\nSatisfries = meh.
1,This place is great!  I went in late in the day with a broken ipad screen and Vahe had it repaired fast!  The cost was the lowest I could find and he was very friendly and helpful!  I highly recomend i Doctor AZ!
1,"Vegetarian turkey sub.  Holy crap.  The best sub ever.\n\nThe boy and I stopped at this location on our way back from a hike at Red Rock Canyon.  We were both pretty hungry but still ordered small subs, which were more than enough.  Half of a small would have been more than sufficient for lunch, but I ate the whole thing because it was so damn tasty.\n\nThey also offer vegetarian cheese steak subs, which sounds pretty interesting.  \n\nOh, and the boy got a regular turkey sub and was impressed by the freshness of everything and that it was actual turkey, not processed slices.\n\nWhen in Las Vegas again I will definitely be making a trip to Capriotti's."
0,"I took my mom and sister out for sushi one night. We stopped by this Ah-So location because we were nearby. However, we ended up going to their other location.\n\nThey only have two regular tables and all of the others are high stools. I realize the high stools and tables are trendy, but they aren't practical or considerate of all patrons (e.g., for older patrons a high stool is not easy to get on and off). In addition, the two regular tables were near a drafty door and a large sign that had the nightly specials was right against one of the regular tables. Anyway, needless to say we ended up leaving because the atmosphere did not feel welcoming and we wanted to celebrate a family special occasion. \n\nI'm not sure about the quality of food since we didn't even make it to a table. But their other location was good and accommodating."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!! I had a pedicure yesterday... Tiffany did it, she cut my toe by scrubbing so hard on my feet. I'm still in a lot of pain because of this! This was and expensive horrible pedicure and I also have to live with the pain of my toe now!!!! Absolutely ridiculous."
0,"I have never been so frustrated!! I made the appointment online; I entered my insurance everything seemed to be good.... Got there 10mins early had to check in...all the same questions I answered online earlier, then I had to call to verify they took my insurance; was transferred 3 different times plus being on hold for 15mins (seems like an hour when u have 2 kids with you) to find out they don't take my insurance..... It isn't faster, defiantly not easier I find this place a waste of time and space!!  Got right in to next care and they took my insurance..."
0,"This is my second visit and likely my last. I was so disappointed in the food quality and service. I treated a friend to the table d'hote and was horrified that she received a burnt  puck of beef after waiting an unreasonable amount of time. The fact the server did not even acknowledge the poor quality/presentation and never asked if we enjoyed the meal, reflects the nonchalance attitude of this place. I am a firm  believer that a sever is the representative of the food and the establishment. And when they don't take ownership of the experience, there's no reason to go back."
1,We originally dealt with Steven Sales as our Agent to buy a home in Henderson in 2011. We dealt with him long distance from New Jersey and met with him to look at homes in Henderson. He was totally professional and on target with our requirements and we found the perfect home and the whole transaction was handled by him here as we returned to New Jersey. He made the deal quick and easy for us and handled all the details so all we had to do was move here and move in to our new home. He recently helped us find the perfect rental for our Granddaughter here in Henderson and she loves the place that he found for her. I would recommend Steven Sales to the most discriminating clientele and have confidence that he would satisfy all of their needs. He is by far and away the best real estate agent I have ever dealt with over the years.
1,"I've been to different Roberto's all over town, and this one is always on top of their   food. Friendly staff, clean building, and great food as always! This place is on top of the way the food is presented and cooked, always very filling and tastes better than the other places in my opinion."
0,"This place is a joke!! ATE there once and got some ribs, i gave them to the dog because they tasted like dog bones!!! Went back several months later with my girlfriend again!! because she wanted to try it out and it was the same, horrible place, bad food!!! don't bother going there!!"
0,"One star is only for the decor of a Chinese noodle restaurant. Don't be fooled by the high ratings of this restaurant like my family did. \n\n** ONLY EAT HERE IF THIS IS THE LAAAAST PLACE YOU CAN FIND CHINESE FOOOD**\n\nLet me advise you why not to come here:\n- first walked in, stood there and waited at the entrance for a good 6-7 minutes for someone to acknowledge my existence although 4 staff members made contact with me as well as it not being busy.\n\n-when my family and I were seated, table next to us had seemingly waited patiently for someone to take their orders. The women and her grandma asked they can please order. The staff members never came around and so they walked out on their table. We were totally shocked.\n\n-Service was worse than most Chinese restaurants which makes me very tolerable to bad service. But, their servers fit in the category of extreme. They give you attitude, they ignore your requests of their service even when you scream out \""hi, excuse me!\"" while raising your arm. Worst of all was when everyone finished their food with the first two entrees ordered had been forgotten, the lady denied of with such a strong passion that they didn't forget about the two entrees. Six of us were all finished before the two had even got their food. No apologies, no nothing. \n\n-then, they asked for the check and they slapped it on the table while saying, \""gratuity is included\"". No thank you, no smile, not even a slight glance before walking away. We reread the menu to double check if they ever mentioned a gratuity policy with a certain number of people. Nope! None.\n\n\n-MOST IMPORTANTLY...THEIR FOOD. The Sui kaow wonton egg noodle soup was mediocre. It had only 1 choy with 5 pieces and was very small. Looked like something you can make at home. Not worth it. Seafood pan friend noodles had too much gravy which made the noodles very soggy. The egg drop beef over rice was horrible. It literally looked like a plate of rice, 7-10 small chunks of beef with scrambled egg then clear gravy poured right on top with it the whole dish being very bland. Our XO chow fun was super bland but overly covered in chilli flakes. Worst of all was finding a dried clump of vermicelli that had chili on it randomly on one of our entrees that had no no vermicelli. It means they're dirty because it was right on top when they placed the entree down.\n\nThis is not the place to go if you want a good meal and experience with very valuable family time. They wasted our time."
0,"Not much has changed at Patties, I'm sorry to report. \n\nWhat has is that they upgraded the TVs! The place is still filthy and reminds one of a bad frat house or a Gila Bend bar, as some have mentioned. It's the dive of dive bars that I have been in through out my USA and Canadian travels. Oh it's no longer cheap to to drink there and they do now have glassware not just plastic cups for your drinks, so that has changed. \n\nThe barkeeper, is an old guy who has been there past his prime. There are photos of him among photos of the crowds on a board where he looks 15 years younger. By now he has no personality and patience for the drinking crowd and this was at the start of Happy Hour on a Tuesday! The way he throws together a mixed drink or offers up the beer/wine list you can tell he just doesn't care anymore. It's pretty awful and sad at the same time. \n\nOne day a week ( I forget which) according to the flier on the wall they offer up a patty (aka burger) night. No other food is served here and how they get the OK to serve on that night from the health board is a mystery. Maybe the pull out a grill into the parking lot, is my best guess. \n\nThe jukebox is a newer version of the equipment, but I didn't stick around to hear it. A regular, some creepy skinny dude said he was going to play it, but warned me no one wold like what he played. I took him at his word. \n\nThe place has a few hundred dollars of mostly US $1 bills stuck on the walls and ceiling in the area close to the bar. They have words, names and comments boldly inked on them. The barkeeper was busy stapling a few recent ones to the wall. He commented to another customer when asked, that he doesn't read them, ever! because only the drunk write and leave them. My what an attitude for one in the drinking& hospitality business! \n\nAmong those mostly dirty and yellowing from nicotine bills you will see a sign near the old gold register handwritten selling \""All Cigarettes are $10\""! Holy Moley and I don't smoke! But apparently many of the patrons do, because the building is split down the center leaving the place open to the sky and elements, which apparently allows them to forgo the nonsmoking ordinances now in effect for establishments. So many freely light up and smoke in the center of the floor/building. \n\nOut of sheer curiosity, on my why out I opened the the women's room door. Eeewwe, the place recked like a bad outhouse, though it had a nice white new pedestal sink and commode, but their was no way I could stomach the room to even primp in the mirror!\n\nI did manage to take a picture at the bar to give you a glimpse of the place. Hopefully it will help you check the stop off your list. Oh and one other thing, I wish bar owners would not publish their political views with bumper stickers in ther establishment - put it on your car or not post it."
0,Horrible experience! I don't know if they have some kind work program going on or what. No real rules. Hostess told my party of 4 we can take any high top at the bar then another hostess came and told us we need to get up since they are going to seat the table with a party of 3 since that's the maximum allowed at that table. Also then told us all the high tops are reserved. Story kept changing then we left management sux!!!!!
1,"This is such an amazing park in Scottsdale, especially considering it's city ran. My little train fanatics loved it because there were, \""choo-choo\"" signals, a tunnel and a cool Western themed park to play at after. The price was right; I spent $9 for myself and my family to ride the train and the carousel (my 2 year old was free).  We spent about 2 hours there, would have been more if the weather was nicer.  \n\nThis park also has a little general store where we picked up some ice cream cones and Icee's after our ride.  Beware of the Thomas section though!! :)"
1,"Driven by many times and always empty. We wanted sushi and didn't want to go far, so tried it tonight. A few people in the place. Prices were reasonable, and they had some unique rolls, like the Dancing Tuna, which had an outside crispy shell. Their Shrimp Tempura was very good, as was their Dragon Roll (eel, cucumber, avo). Also had their Rock & Roll (eel & avo).\nThey have a $5 off coupon on their website: a8sakura.com\nWe talked to the owner. He said he bought the place about a month ago (June 2011) and said the previous owner was mean to customers! Hope people give this place a try as maybe it's much different than the previous owner's place.\nWe actually liked it better than Red Sushi, which took forever to get your food, and though it was okay, it wasn't anything special.\nThey have lunch specials and will try that soon, like 3 Maki rolls for $12, which is a good deal. Non-sushi lunch was teriyaki meals. Wish they had bento lunch boxes, but only dinner for now.\nAnyway, good prices, good service, and good sushi!"
1,This was my first time seeing a new dentist and after 26 years I was a little anxious to say the least. The entire team welcomed me and made me feel like I had known them for years. Thanks guys!! Although I'm bummed I need some fillings I'm not nervous to come back next week! See you then!
1,"Whats not to love?  New space and old, all whimsical shopping that will satisfy every fashionista.  Get a fat tuesday and go drunk shopping! FUN"
1,"I would say one of the best hotels in Vegas. The detail in the design of this hotel is excellent. It's connected to the Palazzo which makes it convenient.  Not too far from Wynn and Encore where the best clubs are at. Tao nightclub is located at the Venetian, pretty nice and big club. It's a club most people want to visit at least once. The pool at the Venetian is fun. They have Tao Beach in the corner that is kind of like a day club at the pool. So many places to shop here so bring some money!\n\nWe stayed in a regular king bedroom. I don't see a difference in getting a bigger suite since all their rooms are considered suites. You aren't even in the room all day anyways. The room was real comfortable. Great size restroom, with two sinks and a sitting area with a mirror to get ready. Beds were comfy. I had no problem with this place."
0,"I am new to Yelp. Here are my star ratings:\n\n1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back.\n2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.\n3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.\n4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.\n5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.\n\nMaybe I was spoiled during the 5 years I lived in ATL. Med Grill in Decatur. Phenomenal. The little hole-in-the-wall place on Broad Street near my office at GSU. Yum. I guess I had it good.\n\nI started to worry when I asked if they ever featured cabbage rolls. They guy \""cooking\"" looked at me with a blank stare and said, \""my wife is Polish, she makes cabbage rolls...\"" Awesome.\n\nI ordered a small Greek salad, hummus, a falafel wrap, and the kibbe special.\n\nThe hummus and falafel wrap were both bland. The pita bread was dry. The greek salad was good, with a generous amount of feta and plenty of chick peas. The kibee special was probably the best part of the meal, but they didnt have laban to go with it.\n\nThey people working there were nice enough.\n\nOh, last straw. The baklava was absolutely awful. Dry and tasted terrible."
0,"Don't go!\n\nNo one cares. If you sit at the bar and order a beer, then fine. But don't bother to sit down and want a meal. They completely ignore you.  What a bunch of losers!!"
1,I love going here! The service is outstanding and it is a great way to paint away my stress. Check it out. Often times you can get a coupon for discounted studio fees online or on Facebook.
1,"Came in last night for my birthday. The place was packed with a waiting line but we had reservations for our party. Steve, our waiter, was amazing and handled our group of 7 adults with swift precision and courtesy. Everyone in our party was impressed with their appetizers & entre's. It was a great experience. Members of our party also kept commenting favorably about the \""Old Las Vegas\"" selection of music classics by Martin, Sinatra, etc. A lot of food so plan on a to-go box."
1,"LGO was fantastic.  Great food, great staff, and an outstanding storefront with the best English Muffins I have ever tasted.  I have dined in twice; however, and found the service to be a little on the slow side.  Also, with regard to crowding and poor parking, LGO suffers from both."
1,I always pass this place on my way home and finally decided to stop in and try it. It was pretty packed which I didn't really expect. I was excited when I saw they had a vegetarian/vegan menu! The young man at counter was polite and explained a lot to us even though it started to get a lot busier. I tried the Chipotle baguette and oh my gosh it was so delicious. I also tried the Thai Tea Frapp which was also amazing. The only weird thing about this place is the location. It's surrounded by realtor/business offices  so it might be confusing the first time you go there. The service was great too and the staff were very friendly. I have to stop by again to try their teas.
0,"Novelty - 8/10 - Go once to tell people you've been there.  And duh your going to see sexy nurses and a unique restaurant concept that is telling you to eat so unhealthy it will kill you.  Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with. \n\nFood - 3/10 - Take my word and other yelp comments the burger is nothing special.  The meat is very bland and has no memorable seasoning or sauce (yawn).  For a \""burger\"" joint when calories are no concern you think it was the most amazing flavor ever.  It's not.  Burger Guru's go elsewhere.  The fries were a huge disappointment as well.  I went with 6 other people.  We all blamed the soggy fries on being the \""bottom\"" of the pan.  We got more unlimited fries when a fresh batch came out and no one loved them at all.  Its funny cause there is a video playing on flat screens and when we saw the crispy looking fries on screen we were like 'we want those!'.  The milkshakes were also disappointing because people expected more flavor like thick ice cream.  It was a very generic base that they just pump flavored syrup into, no blenders.  Also, people that dined the same day as us found a hair ball in the double burger.  It was pretty gross when he held it up and the nurses came running to replace!  I cant wait for his review!\n\nWho will go again?  0 out of 6 of us.\n\nWho is talking about this place to their friends and family? 6 out of 6 of us.\n\nWho felt a little sick to their stomachs? 4 out of 6 of us.\n\nOverall go once have fun.  But if you want a great tasting burger and some calories that may lead to an eventual heart attack find a gourmet burger spot with some crispy bacon, blue cheese crumbles, special sauce, and maybe even a fried egg on top.  A good burger is good til the last bite, this was not."
1,"Last day in Vegas .. Tired , fat , and hungover .. We wanted to go get some soup to \""burn off the grease\"" in our system. Dumb of us to come eat greasy pho but at the moment it made sense. \n\nMade our way to a strip mall a little off the Vegas strip. Tried the small #15. Pretty decent. Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious. \n\nWe ordered the fried Calamari as appetizers for the table. Amazing. Must come back for these. Its the traditional calamari but with a Asian twist. Loved it. Portions were pretty generous as well."
0,"At first I didn't want to go to Burger Dogs because the price of the fries. However, a co-worker brought some burgers to work and offered Me one, although I'd already eaten, I was suprised at how much I liked the fries. My friends said the burgers were good. I went there Saturday, there was one car at the window and I was at the order menu. The Gal came on and said \""be right with You\"", fine. Then, after waiting a while I started keeping track of the time on My dash clock. I waited 4 minutes longer, backed out and went to mcdonalds. Good fries there too. Also, the flier They left on My car about a month ago, didn't have the hours of operation or phone number. Burger Dogs is MIS-MANAGED and will fail."
0,"For the last 10 or so years I have used this shuttle on my annual trip.  Last year there were problems, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt...till it all happened again this year... so at the airport we waited a good 40 minutes for the shuttle - would have refunded if they allowed it, and took another company that was coming and going like a beast.  We had a scheduled pick up at NYNY...after 20 minutes of it not coming, I called... they said we were not there when the driver came and left... BS we were there early and saw other companies come through... save your Vegas time and take another transportation option!"
1,"What a wonderful evening! Henry, the owner, was very personable and offered to take care of the menu for us. He was constantly sending out food at lightening speed. It was delicious and was a nice wide variety. I especially loved the cabbage, chicken, and eggplant. The service was excellent and the company was stimulating. Typical strip mall atmosphere so that's why only 4 stars."
0,"Went here for a family dinner. I originally stumbled onto this right at the grand opening but feel as if the quality has dropped dramatically. The rolls are small and  shriveled, the quality of the fish is mediocre, not fresh but not fishy either. The family owners are great but I just can't lead people to believe that this is the best sushi in the area. There are places that offer full healthy rolls that forte fresh fish instead of added fillers and fancy sauces littering the top."
1,"Located in planet Hollywood, this burger joint is my favorite! I've tried almost all of them and you really can't go wrong with any of the choices. \nTheir truffle fries are to die for. And their chicken wing appetizer is also a good pick! \nEverything on the menu is reasonably priced"
1,"Yes, it's all true what's been said about Jennifer. She is THAT fantastic and definitely knows skincare. I've had two treatments done with her and am looking forward to going back to her on a regular basis. I have finally found my official esthetician. Her prices are reasonable, her treatments work (none of that extra fruffy stuff I don't need), and best of all she's not a product pusher. Though with her wealth of knowledge on skin care products, I couldn't help but ask her opinion on things. I love that she gives me honest answers about skin care lines. \n\nBasically, if you're looking for an honest person who will help you achieve great results with your skin, go see Jennifer. I'm so glad that she's here in the valley!"
0,"Wanted to try this place the last time I came to Vegas but then we missed our reservation time and therefore didn't get to try so we thought eh why not try it this time. And so we did. Now my parents aren't really big fan of American style restaurants like these and I think that this place didn't change their minds about it. \n\nFirst of all the service was okay...our waitress seem a little preoccupied or rather annoyed with us taking our time.....so I didn't feel like her service was all that great but it wasn't all that terrible either....I would like to think that she probably just had a long day and was really tired.....so I will let that go. \n\nBoth my parents ordered the Pumpkin Soup and I didn't like pumpkin but that was the only soup they were serving so I didn't get a starter. My bf tried their Blue Corn Pancake with bbq duck....it was really meant for one serving...actually after seeing that I realized all the appetizers were made for one serving....bf said it the duck meat was overloaded with Hoisin sauce so it was pretty sweet. I didn't know that the appetizers were going to be so small because I didn't really want to eat that much so I ordered the Blue Corn Lobster Taco as an entree....turns out it was three bite sized tacos....it was good but for the price it was just not worth it.\n\nI ordered the Veal chop for my mom and the Green Chile  Cioppino for my dad. I guess he really didn't like the flavor because he only ate the one jumbo prawn and the scallops but not the Bass, Clams or the Mussels. He said the fish had a weird texture and the flavor was weird. My mom liked the veal chop...I tried a piece of it and it was indeed very tender and flavorful. We had a side dish of spinach - $9 dollars for a small bowl even though it was meant to be shared.....ehhh not worth it. My bf apparent enjoyed his Mango Spiced Rubbed Tuna Steak....it did look pretty good and I tried a piece of that too and I guess it was pretty good. \n\nThe bill came out to be around 250ish plus tip....I was expecting a three digit bill however I didn't expect it to be in the 200's.....the quality and quantity of the food was just not worth that amount of money and I don't really think I would come back. I wasn't really satisfied with the food or service and quite frankly I left still hungry. My parents weren't impressed either and I think they were still hungry too but just didn't say anything to me....=/"
0,"Let me preface this by saying that I do like Pure's sushi, however, their service is really subpar despite this trying economy. Last weekend, a buddy and I went to the restaurant where we were greeted by a cute hostess who made us wait for 20 minutes with available tables in sight. We were then seated on the patio at the only table without a space heater. From there, we sat staring at each other for an additional 25 minutes without a greeting from any of Pure's staff members who glided past us with smiles on their faces and plates and plates of food. Finally fed up, we grabbed a busboy who brought a manager to our table. He played his whole shocked and embarrassed card, but in the end offered nothing for our trouble other than, \""Can I get you something now?\"" What a joke! I used to like Pure, but I certainly don't have any plans on going back, at least not to the North Scottsdale location."
0,"We called Arc Electric randomly after doing an on-line search and reading reviews. We had them come out to look at some needed work on a newly purchased property. Alex came out and took a look at  the work to be done. We liked Alex and were ready to review the estimate and go forward with the work. After he pulled away from the property, saying he would get us an estimate that afternoon, we never heard from him again. No estimate, no e-mail, no response to our calls or text. Weird.\nI would have rather heard he wasn't able to do the work or it didn't fit his schedule or something so we wouldn't have wasted 3 days trying to track him down.\nWe hired another company and completed the work easily and quickly."
0,"First of all, I will admit the bagels are great.  They have done a great job with the classic bagel and cream cheese breakfast.  However, the cafe lacks in the bagel sandwich department.  The omelet used on the bagel was mixed in a bowl then cooked in a microwave.  Personally, this is not my ideal way to cook an egg, especially when it costs $10 for a bagel sandwich with an omelet and spread.   Also, Yelp, they do not accept credit cards.  They only accept debit cards and even so, a Visa debit card was not accepted (for Americans planning on going).  I know that does not sound like a big deal, however, the manger was very rude when we tried to pay with our American debit card and her attitude really ruined the meal for us.\n\nThe St-Viateur Bagel shop a few blocks away was pleasant.  It is simple, bagels and cream cheese, that is it!  What else do you need?"
0,"This place is always empty and with good reason. It's pricey, the guys are a bit skeesy and they do a terrible job! When they \""washed\"" my car there were still dead bugs on the front....gross....and a plastic piece from the interior of my car was sitting on my passenger seat!! I asked where did that snap off from and why is it on my seat?? They replied with \""I don't know\"".\nMind you it's a new car and pieces tend not to fall off at random. It took three dudes but they finally figured out how to put it back on.....way to go car wash guys."
1,This Ross is  a little nicer than all the other ones I've been to.  Good selection and familiar layout.\n\nThe registers are better laid out at this store and I really appreciate it because even when it's busy the line moves quickly!
0,"Eating at rosa's as i write this. Waited a few minutes for my turn at the hostess stand. Lady in front of me said, 'table for 2'. Hostess said she was only seating full parties, not partial parties! What a crock. Dining room was not even half full. Hostess asked me how many in my party and i said only one and got a seat right away. Once seated, i told server that i was,a party of two and needed another place setting. Four stars for food, four stars for wait staff and zero stars for a hostess thats got no common sense."
1,"I would totally stay at New York, New York again. We upgraded our room  so we could have a view of the strip. Although a little pricey, the room was big for a hotel room with floor to ceiling windows which gave us amazing views. Not a lot of time was spent in the hotel room, but the views at night left amazing memories. \n\nI was warned by a friend that the roller coaster is noisey but it was actually pretty silent, it was never loud enough to bother or wake us up. The friends we went with were pretty stoked to hear that you can ride the roller coaster for free if you stay at the hotel (i think its about $10 to ride the roller coaster normally).\n\nThe beds were really comfortable with super soft sheets. I never sleep good on hotel beds but I actually had a really amazing sleep the nights we were there. The room was always nice and clean, as well as the rest of the hotel. \n\nAs for downstairs, theres a Espn sports club as well as a Coyote Ugly. Dont forget tons among tons of slot machines and card tables, but since its NYNY there are New York facades that have breakfast and lunch foods for pretty reasonable prices. Its really cool to walk around down there before adventuring onto the strip. On the same floor as the arcade, theres a Nathans NY Hot Dogs that has amazing chili dogs, hamburgers, chili fries etc. \n\nNYNY is definitely worth checking out."
0,"I went there today with my boyfriend excited to try a cannoli. The line wasnt too bad. We waited about 15 minutes before our number was called. We placed the order and were asked to stand in line at the register. We waited at the register for like 20-30min. When its our turn at the register the cashier asks if were #70, we were #75, so we stepped to the side and we notcied all the numbers the cashier was calling were out of order. So what the hell was the point of standing in line? The cashier could talk for days. I understand she wants to provide good customer service but cmom theres a crowd, get that line moving. When its our turn she repeats the order which sounded accurate. We get home and realize that one of our California Cheesecakes is not in any of the boxes. We tried to call to see if they could refund for that one or atleast let me go pick it up but they never answer the phone. I understand they just opened but have some sort of organization and answer the phone."
1,"In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. I hit this Buffet at least twice when I stay. One of the best Buffets on the strip. It has every ethnic culture covered, one of the best chefs working and for what you pay is $$$, it's still a good deal. One of the most do things when in Vegas."
0,WARNING! Check to see if they give you EXACTLY what you ordered if it is to go..They never get the order right..Whoever owns this place should look into replacing this incompetent staff of low IQ teenagers.
1,"This place made an otherwise near-miserable trip to Vegas (here's a tip: never stay off the strip, no matter what) tolerable. In fact, if I focus on this, I can almost forget the taste of smoke in my mouth, the toothless guy with the cracked hands that kept grabbing my arm, and the horrendousness of my off-the-strip suite in hell.  \n\nI loved the feel of sitting on the \""patio\"" in the square. I loved the fried squash blossoms - the bit of ricotta was completely unexpected and delicious and I can't wait to have it again.\n\nThe blood orange cosmo was divine, not at all syrupy like other cosmos, and it lacked the bitter after taste I sometimes get with cosmos made with orange vodka. \n\nAnd then there's the pizza. I'm giving up pizza for a month because the Pancetta with carmelized onions and goat cheese was as good as pizza gets. The tomato sauce was fantastic, a little tangy, which I adored. The goat cheese wasn't too earthy like goat cheese sometimes is, and well, how can you go wrong with pancetta and onions? The crispy thin crust was still chewy, too. Hooray! \n\nSeriously, when in the Venetian, head down here in the afternoon, ideally just before the mimes start a performance (ask for a seat that allows a view) and order yourself a glass or two of Prosecco or some blood orange cosmos. Order the pizza (any will do) and try yourself some fried squash blossoms...you'll thank me.\n\nAnother tip: Don't go to any off-the-strip buffets, even if 16 of your friends are going there for dinner. You'll regret everything about that decision."

0,"So my bf and I wanted a drink and snacks since it was happy hour at 2 we went and we were in a bit of a hurry cause my bf had to go to work at 3 so it just turned 2 so we weren't really in a rush since we THOUGHT they would give us our meal in 5 min NOPE we pull up,press the red button it lights up......nothing we do it again...nothing. People next to is pulled up and ordered already. So we back out and go into another menu same thing waited about 2 min then they finally answered I asked is one of you menu broken? They said nope. So I told them what happens and we been waiting for 5-8 mins for someone to answer then they said o yeah one of the menus is broken. So I'm like alright and we ordered room about 15 min till our order came and that's when we were in a rush. Another time my bf ordered chili cheese fries they gave him what looked/tasted like plastic cold cheese fries and my strawberry limeade had way to many strawberry chunks in it I felt like I didn't even drunk anything mostly ate the strawberries and could really taste some syrup Idk it was too sweet! They need to retrain or idk but they been messing up a lot. Not gonna go here again"
0,"This place is a freaking joke!\n\nMy dog had an abscess tooth root and his face was swollen up. \n\nI brought him in and he was misdiagnosed with a bug bite and given some antibiotics to get rid of the swelling: $200. \n\nA year later it came back big time and was infected! They lanced it and gave me medicine until he could get an extraction:  $200\n\nBrought him in for the extraction which cost $600 and they pulled a tooth on the wrong side of his mouth!! \n\nWhen I contacted them they wanted me to pay to have them remove the correct tooth!! Finally after not backing down they decided to do my the \""courtesy\"" of extracting the correct tooth free of charge but refused to refund any of the now $1000 I had paid previously for his treatment even though they knew that I had to open a care credit card to pay for the surgery!!\n\nMy dog now has two large gaps on either side of his mouth and has trouble eating...\n\nNever! Ever! Ever! Let them near your dog!!"
0,"So my friend wanted to come to this place because it the chef was on Food Networks' Chopped.  Sure, breakfast.  What can go wrong?\n\nThis is clearly a locals place, but I have to wonder, has this place gone downhill since being on tv?\n\nWe went on a Saturday, a bit after the brunch rush, it wasn't even lunch time yet.  They were not busy, and it was \""seat yourself\""\n\nA server came pretty quickly to take our order, but man did we wait FOREVER for our food.\n\nIt was 30 minutes (no exaggeration, I timed it) after she took our order, and we were STILL waiting for our food.  We looked around, first off they were NOT busy, the place was not full, but there were people that were already seated before us that were also still waiting for their food.  We also never saw our server again.  No one came to check in on us, no one came to check on drinks, or to tell us sorry it's taking so long, but the food is on it's way.\n\nWe didn't order anything complicated, a Ham hash and a corned beef hash.  That's it, we didn't even substitute anything.  Seriously - all this stuff should have been prepped and ready to just throw together.\n\nI don't know what they were doing in the kitchen but come on, this was completely unacceptable. \n\nThe food at least came out piping hot, so at least we had that. I'm only giving it 2 stars because the food was decent, but nothing to write home about.\n\nIt wasn't too bad for the price, but when Egg and I is not too far away, I will never come here again."
0,"When giving two stars, the Yelp Star selector says \""Meh. I've experienced better\"" and strangely enough the word \""Meh\"" is flagged on Yelp's own spell checker. This is puzzling to me. How is it that Yelp can use the word \""Meh\"" yet their own spell checker rejects the use of this oh so appropriate verbiage, especially when describing Viet Kitchen. I work really close to this little place, which is always very clean and is staffed by some very nice folk. The menu selection is ample yet typical of any Vietnamese fair... Pho, Vermicelli dishes, French type sandwiches, spring rolls, etc.\n\nBut everything I've had is just.... here it comes..... you know what I'm gonna say.... you guessed it..... MEH. Nothing is great, everything is just ok. Where's the love? This is how I feel about the place. If you're completely Jonesing (another term not in spell checker) for Vietnamese food, this place will satisfy your craving, but after your meal you might end up saying \""Meh, I've experienced better\""."
1,Love the wild mushroom soup here. One complaint I have is it is not HOT enough. To me it should be hot no matter what because of health regulation. \nfree chocolate dipped strawberries.
1,"Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!"
0,very disappointed.  all of the other reviews made it seem like I have been missing the best sushi ever and it was not.  for the price not worth it
0,"I'm so far not impressed.  I mean, sure the ceilings are high but that's kind of where the positives end.\n\nFirst of all, it's quite small.  For a library servicing such a large area, I would have expected a *much* larger space.  Most importantly though, not all of the book cases are labelled so I wandered around trying to find a specific genre of books and eventually had to ask a member of staff.  Beyond this, the staff member who helped me was unable to read the system well enough to see that the book I was looking for had been reserved (I found this out when I looked for myself) and spent a good 15 minutes wandering around trying to find it.  Sure, it was nice that she looked but as a staff member surely she should know how to read the system?\n\nSo, I left underwhelmed.  I know people don't use the library as much as they used to but maybe they would use it more if it didn't have such a tired and uncared-for feeling to it?"
0,"VERY RUDE  and  a NON-PROFESSIONAL Management! BURNT CRUST!!\n\nFor the life of me I do not understand what the big hype is about their BLAND nasty pizza!!\nNot worth any wait time.(3-4 hours) whats So ever.NOT for big appetites,its rabbit food.If I can save someone from going there, then then it was worth my time writing this.You are better off buying pizza hut or a pizza from the supermarket will tasty better than their pizza.When they say thin crust , they mean THIN crust!.You need to order at least three pizzas in order to get full.At $15.00 a pop, I  don't think so! THUMBS DOWN ALL THE WAY!! I believe management is writing their own reviews about how great they are.LOL"
0,Service is slow the food is ok. I ordered a small fruit bowl and it turned out to be canned fruit. Don't order that. It is just gross!
1,"I cannot say enough amazing things about this place! Went here over a year ago the night we got married. The service was fabulous... the food was just as fabulous... our bartender (Mari) was so cute and sweet and really genuinely excited to have served us on the night we got married. On our anniversary, a year later... we went back here and lucky us, Mari was working.. She remember us and gave us the same fantastic service. The manager came over to greet us and thank us for coming back and he even brought us an amazing appetizer on the house (not sure of the name on the appetizer but it was some scallop dish presented on half shells -- AMAZING)... they did this on our first visit as well... Mari gave us two amazing drinks on the house as well. The food here is literally the BEST sushi I have ever had.... the service cannot be beat..and a great ambiance!\n\nMy husband and I absolutely love this place and we have made a standing date at this place every year for our anniversary. I will not visit Vegas and skip a visit to this place! Can't wait to go back! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could..."
0,"Well, where to start? Let's see we sat down and got our drinks ( good thing they were all waters ) Our waiter then took our orders, so far so good. Well that is where it ended. My mother and I got each other's orders, I got the turkey burger and she got a well done hamburger. Well, she got my turkey burger and I got her well done burger. The waiter says that he messed the order up but it was the kitchen that messed it up. So the waiter did the right thing and made the order right. The manager came over and apologized and said our food would be right out. That took close to 30 min. My wife and kids already had eaten and our food arrived, finally. The meal for me was good and my mom enjoyed hers the kids liked theirs, my wife later told me that her burger was well done and she asked for a med. this was not a big deal because she was hungry. When the check came my wife said that they should have taken one or two burgers off the bill because of the screw up....... Nothing was taken off. We will not be back to this restaurant , and would not recommend this  restaurant  to anyone. Oooooooooh by the way they had no more then 15 people in the restaurant and had 6-8 waiters...... Sad we use to like this place"
0,"HATED this place...\n\n1. The buildings need elevators at BOTH ends!\n2. Get some new TVs\n3. Needs more comfortable bedding\n4. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.....get new toilet seats! They were sooooo old that there were wear marks down to the bare material from all the ass rubbing goin on, disgusting!\n\n...much more could be said, but I think I got my point across\n\n1 star is being generous..DO NOT STAY HERE"
0,"It's a Macaroni Grill... not much to say about this... if you have gone to one, you have seen them all. Nothing is really memorable. Including the service. Prices are reasonable."
0,Went in to get a quick haircut one morning and the stylist cut my hair crooked.   I am not sure how she did not notice because it was prerty bad.  Went somewhere else to have it fixed.
1,"Leslie does an amazing job every time I go. I have referred her to all my family and friends.  She is always prompt. I never wait past my appointment time, which I appreciate.  The lashes last longer than any other place I have tried, a full three to four weeks.  I never have that weird stingy feeling or any irritation.  It's relaxing, enjoyable, and worth every penny.  I was a mascara addict before, now I just wake up and go!\n\nHighly recommend."
0,Visited this restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend and it was awful. The service was very unattentive and slow. We ordered an omelet and egg rolls and it took thirty minutes for our food and we were the only two in the restaurant. And let's not talk about the mixed drinks. Will never go back.
0,"I've been weeknight drinking here before and was pleased with the draft selection, but recently I went for food and wished I hadn't.\n\nThe chips were stale and chewy, but at least the salsa was okay. Most places don't know how to prepare fresh and flavorful vegetarian food, so I wasn't completely surprised when I got the tofu tacos and couldn't taste anything but the salted \""sweet\"" corn. The tofu was cold, the lettuce was warm, and the avocado \""sauce\"" didn't taste like anything at all. \n\nThis is not the way anyone should spend National Taco Day. I'm going to need a do-over for sure."
0,"Planned on staying after a late night return flight and parked my car at hotel upon departure.  Was able to get an earlier return flight and thus did not need room, so cancelled a day in advance (during my trip).  Received cancellation number from agent - no problem.  Upon returning to hotel to pay for parking ($5 per day = $10, but they charged me $15) was RUDELY told by desk agent Eric that I was wrong and would have to pay for night anyway.  Charged my card and abruptly dismissed me.  \n\nHotel manager - when I called later to request a refund rudely scanned/emailed the parking contract and said \""if you park, you have to stay a night\"".  Fine, I'll pay, but I'll NEVER use another La Quinta again.\n\nFrom what I was able to see the property was sloppy, bathrooms dirty, breakfast area musty.  Don't bother - there are PLENTY of other good properties near the CLT Airport."
0,"The trio appetizer inspired mixed emotions; the guacamole and salsa were quite tasty, but the chips were cold and stale. The queso, forming the trio, was neither good or bad, it just was. The atmosphere was spacious and open, but the games on the large screens were so loud, my friends and I had difficulty hearing each other. Our server was adorable... when she was around. By this, I mean, we often wondered where she was, and it's a good thing our entrees were good, because I might still be waiting to let her know if I needed anything, as she did not check on us. We had to locate the hostess to ask for our check. They did not appear to be busy, but I wonder if the staffing was short that day."
0,"My friends and I decided to check this place out because it was nothing I have ever experienced before. It is an interesting experience. To begin with they have promoters offering free shots for your whole party, which is how they get you. They charge you 15 dollars to go into this lounge which is basically a big freezer. The admission includes a coat, boots, and gloves. If you get the more expensive admission, it includes a cap and a fur coat. Either way, I feel like it was a waste of money. They make you leave your phone and all cameras outside. They use their own photographer to take pictures, which they charge about 20 dollars per picture. Rip Off!\n Me and my friends go into the lounge on a Saturday night, and it was NOT packed. There were only two groups of people and it was like a total of 10 people in there. The whole concept is interesting, the drinks came in an ice cup and were super cold. The drinks were tasty but they were not strong at all. We stayed for maybe about an hour before it got way too cold and we left. \nOverall, I have had a great experience and a good time, but I don't think I will be coming back"
1,"Delicious, off the wall breakfasts in HUGE portions, make this a place to check out.\nTo give you an idea of what I mean by \""off the wall\"", how about a 24oz. can of Budweiser served in a brown paper bag? Yep, it's on the menu. The Bloody Mary's are huge & tasty.\nJust a fun place to take people for breakfast. But be ready to wait, this place is ALWAYS poppin'!"
1,"I also booked through Tru Cab after seeing their great reviews. I needed a ride to the airport early in the morning (around 5:30am) and booked for a pickup the day before I needed to leave on the website. I received a call within the hour confirming my pickup, which was great. \n\nThe morning of, the cab driver called 30 minutes prior to pickup to confirm also confirmed the number of coffees and donuts we requested and whether we wanted cream and sugar. That's right, if you book before 9am you receive complimentary coffee and donuts. I thought this was a really nice extra that sets them apart. \n\nThe driver arrived 5 minutes early, took us the fastest route to the airport, was not creepy, and we were able to pay with a credit card with no issues. Also, cab smelled and looked clean. I would absolutely use Tru Cab again, and definitely recommend it if you are looking for a prompt, cost efficient, professional cab service."
0,"I have typically stopped in to toss a few bucks into the machines when bored but have eaten here on occasion too.  \n\nFirst off, while it's probably not so, you just get the feeling that nothing in the place is clean.  It's old.  It shows no signs of renovation and thus the feeling of 25 years  (just a guess) of being open twenty-four hours a day catches up with the place.  As I have seen in other reviews, the smoke hanging in the air doesn't jibe well with an eating establishment.  I had it at 3 stars, but writing the review, I just can't give 3 (A ok) to a place where my clothes stink like smoke every time I spend an hour there.\n\nFood positive:  Only place I know you can get a Bratzel (brat/burger combo on a pretzel bun)!  Food negative:  This place sort of touts itself as a Packer (ie Wisconsin) establishment but the cheese curds are terrible and covered in some sort of Parmesan cheese or something - gross - that's not how you serve cheese curds.  Oh...and as a \""sports\"" bar, shouldn't you have the Big 10 network??  They don't."
0,"I had visited this comic book shop it was honest to God my first and final time in this store. I had walked in with my video camera which I was filming for a documentary and had moved here from California recently. Not even less than a moment of being in there. I barely had walked in until I was confronted by the manager who was hostile and aggressive when approached. He had asked of me what the purpose was that I was filming for and responded to him letting him know, I then had asked of him if it was alright with his permission for me to film in there. He then had said to me \""It's too late now to ask\"" I was not allowed to film in there because I was not granted permission from him to do so. Those were his exact words. This is the most venomous and vile customer service I've encountered. After he realized who I was and that I had a celebrity status he later had changed his tone of voice and attitude.\nI've let him know I would have approached him to ask him for his permission if only had I known to my knowledge that he was one of the owners there who had operated the shop, common sense and logic would have told you, you are supposed to have an employee I.D at least a lanyard around you're neck to identify you are an official worker there or a badge. Otherwise I had an impression that he was just another customer in there. I did not appreciate the hostile attitude towards me and inflicted at me. I had given them a call later that evening and addressed myself more in depth and all they could manage to do was constantly apologize and invite me back into their storefront. I've let them know this was the final time I was ever to step foot in their business again.\nIn conclusion to this my final decision is never to conduct my business with them again and strongly advise anyone else to be Leary and avoid them like a plague.\nThere is an old expression, both actually.\n\""You're customers are always right\"" and \""Once bit twice shy\"""
0,"Good food, but I waited over an hour in the Arizona sun to receive it. Super slow service for a food truck. It might as well be a full blown restaurant if you're going to wait that long.  I would've given it one star just for the terrible slow service but it had vegan and vegetarian options so I bumped it up to 2."
0,I think this place at one time was pretty good.  I came for dinner with my daughter because she said she wanted to try lobster.  It wasn't very good. I've had better at Red Lobster.  I very disappointed considering the reputation they have.  I would not come here again.
0,"Logging in here after many years away just to say how incompetent Cox is. Six weeks after moving to a new apartment I'm still calling them every few days to sort out billing issues. They are so bad it must be some kind of official policy. Seriously. The day Google Fiber comes to Phoenix, I won't hesitate to switch."
1,"I had never been before but I thought, \""typical steakhouse, I'm sure it will be ok\"" I was very wrong. The service was excellent, the wine list was great, the gruyere popovers... Oh my GOSH. The food was wonderful. The interior is rustic/Modern.... love all the wood details. Bright. And a great place for a casual business lunch."
1,"I use MAC a lot because I just love their products. This store is a little small as the other reviews state but they had everything I needed. The girl who helped me was great and looked up all my products from another store and I was out in less then 10 minutes  on a busy Saturday night.  Great experience, I will definitely go back for to that location for my products."
0,"I though it was a little strange to have a business out of your house (let alone questionably legal- is that legal?), but it was even stranger waiting on a dirty porch with dying plants surrounding me and foil in the windows, thinking all the while I was going into a business. However, after a half an hour sitting on the porch past my appointment time, with no life from the shutters, I cut my losses and left.\nAfter several calls and texts, \""lily\"" hasn't called me back concerning the missed appointment.\nLuckily I found someone who could take me last minute- and they look great! Maybe I dodged a bullet considering the other review?"
1,"BRAVO!!!! Applause, applause.  Love the music, well done by the cast.  The whole show is a MUST see!!!  The set and production was absolutely amazing."
0,All I can say is that we were starving and needed some heavy food to prepare us for a night on the town. Their food is pretty bad and I'm for certain that my burrito was cooked in a microwave and then smothered with red sauce. The beans they use are definitely canned and probably the cheapest you can buy. I don't know what kind of  beans they were but they were a weird brownish gray color and I picked them out of my burrito. Most Mexican places use refried beans. This place they were whole and undercooked. Yikes! We were lucky that we didn't get food poisoning.
0,"I was pre-warned that this is a dive bar, but still, this was low even for my standards. There wasn't much that I really cared for except for my cheap $3 mich ultra. The place is really small and it was packed so it was really difficult to move around. The bathroom was insanely small and crowded with a bunch of chicks primping (not that this place really called for any necessary primping).\n\nI can get past all of the surface stuff, but the service is what really turned me off to this place. Although the bar was pretty full, there weren't many people actually sitting at the bar, so I sat down on a stool and waited about ten minutes to even be asked for my drink order. I get that can happen when people are busy, but the bartenders walked right past me and looked at me a few times, cash in hand. After I did get my first drink, getting the second was even trickier! After seeming complely invisible to the bartenders I was finally served by the barback that happened to be up there putting something away.\n\nEveryone elses reviews seem to indicate this is a cool place, so maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind. Either way, waiting so long to be served is a big downfall at a bar in my book, so Coach House gets 2 stars for now. I'm not opposed to giving it another try though and hopefully my next experience will get a higher rating!"
0,"Last night my husband and I had a very short baby sitting window to grab a few bites and drinks. After stopping next door at Sienna for a drink and app we decided to head over to NOLA next.\nI have been there once before a few years ago with a girlfriend and I had the best oyster stew I have ever had. That is why I gave a two star review. Unfortunately this time we didn't get to try anything to eat. \nWe sat ourselves at the bar after alerting the host that we were there for a drink and an app. It seemed fairly busy. Not crazy, but decently busy. We sat and waited for anyone to acknowledge our arrival. Down the bar we saw a barback polishing glasses. A couple employees farther down chatting it up with each other. So we decided to give it a few minutes before making any rational decisions. \nAnother minute or so goes by. The manager walks right by us with glasses without even looking at us or any of the other guests at the bar. At this point we realize that we think there is only one bartender for the whole 20 person bar. My thing is if you only have one bartender and barback maybe help your employees out a little bit? \nSo another couple minutes go by. We decide to give it another 60 seconds. And alas, nothing. So we missed out on our stew and drink we were looking forward to and decided to get up and leave. \nI don't know if anyone noticed the two people sitting at the bar got up and left. I honestly hope they did. We are both in the restaurant/bar industry and the first thing you do when you are in the weeds is at least aknowledge to new guests that you will be with them shortly. We may have been more forgiving if someone at least said hello to us. \nMaybe one day we will try to include NOLA into our downtown restaurant hop date-night again. But probably not in the near future."

0,This place isn't here anymore! This is the 5th time on our trip that yelp has do e this to is.
1,The people are so helpful and friendly. Tonopah Rob really enjoys what he does. He is always happy to share ideas on how to prepare the vegetables. But he seems to cater to more then mores.
0,"Yuck!! It would have to be a 1 for this review here's why, when I went there a couple of months ago and the waiter didn't even speak English. He asked if we wanted soder? meaning soda and we didn't even know what that meant. Also, The place was not fancy at all? The walls were painted crazy colors and the tables were crappy looking. It's also weird how you can't see in the restaurants so you don't know what your getting into. We also though the food was terrible so we had to act like we liked it. So in conclusion I don't know how long this place has been there, but go in at your own risk!!! I'm not going back S- TO THE S-CARY"
1,"The breakfast burrito was pretty good. The Danish was very very good.  Very flaky and the cream cheese center was delicious!  The pineapple bun was not to my liking.  I will have to stick with BBQ buns and such from here when I want Asian buns... To that ends, I can say Donna's Asian buns are downright divine and the price is right for sampling... Get your hands on her buns as soon as you can..."
0,First time coming here and took an hour to get a burger on a weekday and after the first bite I find a long black hair cooked into the burger meat!
0,So I wish I had a good response for this hotel but unfortunately I don't. Our room was spectacular but the service is absolutely just horrible with any type of hospitality what so ever. I would prefer not to go into Great detail but all in all they had several opportunities to make our stay redeemable but there was no chance of that ever happening. I would definitely pay extra money to stay in the Wynn because I hear they actually provide service there...  Even though I did pay a good amount of money to stay at Paris. So if you're looking for good service please stay away from this hotel.... So I really didn't even want to give them a star but in order for me to share my opinion I have to do something...
0,"I guess my pizza was better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, but I wouldn't likely eat here again, which is unfortunate because it's so close to my office.\n\nMy pizza was made with cheap ingredients and tasted like it. The breading wasn't anything to write home about either.\n\nNot sure where all the 4- and 5-star reviews are coming from... Clearly they're either faked, customers don't know the difference between crap pizza and quality pizza, or they've downgraded their ingredients since then (2 weeks ago in reference to Joey B's 5-star review!). Poor Joey wouldn't know good pizza if it gave him a reach around!\n\nIf you want amazing New York-style pizza in Mesa, go to Venezia's (venezias.com) and if you want the best New York-style pizza in Arizona, go to Joe's (eatatjoesny.com) in Scottsdale."
0,"I am finally updating this now that I have the time. See my previous review for the whole story. My car STILL did not consistently start correctly directly after the repairs. Called to speak to Chad since he had told us that if the problem was not resolved, they would refund the $300. Took almost two weeks for him to respond to our multiple calls. He then told us that they could look at it again but did not seem to want to honor that refund we were promised. Look at it AGAIN??? That's not the same as a refund."
0,The food was horrible. Do not waste your money.
0,"Terrible restaurant! Out waitress was not friendly and didn't check on us. All the staff looks miserable. You expect more from a new restaurant. Food comes and it's cold. The potatoes weren't cooked, sent the food back they offered to remake it but choose not to eat. Tasted terrible anyways... Asked for more coffee and the waitress threw it on the table. That's when I had enough and went and got the manager. I'm sitting here in the restaurant writing this because it was that bad! We should have walked out when we walked in because we heard one of the employees apologizing to someone on the phone."
0,"I was excited to try this restaurant yesterday because it's one of the few Indian restaurants that serves south Indian food.  I checked the times on the website and Facebook for dinner service and arrived during what I thought was dinner service. I was told the restaurant was not seating customers because of a private party, only takeout was available. Anyone familiar with south Indian food (ie dosas) knows it doesn't lend itself to takeout so I left disappointed and doubt I will go back. So my review is for poor service (why not post on Facebook that there is no dinner service?), not the food. I would advise anyone to call before making the trip to make sure you will be served."
1,"Was on vacation in Scottsdale, looking for the perfect gift.  I stumbled upon Gotta Have It! and wanted to buy everything in the store.  Not only was their merchandise adorable, the customer service was exceptional and the prices affordable.  I highly recommend this store for anyone looking for a cute piece of jewelry, clothing, handbag, or knick knack.  My favorite item was the reading glasses with the lights on the frames.  Who doesn't need those when reading a menu in a dark restaurant?  Definitely stop by this store in Scottsdale and/or Phoenix!"
0,"We were looking for good ole pub food and excited when we saw Todd English P.U.B.  This place is great for beers but food - the quality does not justify the price.\n\nDirty Chicken : way too salty\nLobster Roll: you would imagine that it would be a freshly baked roll.\n\nThe only good dish was the Shepherd's Pie.\n\nHowever, not enough for me to want to go back.  In fact, we didn't finish most of the dishes."
1,"It's magical! It's a forest! It's the Magical Forest! \n\nOpportunity Village (OV) organises, produces, and benefits from the Magic Forest, held every year on November and December for the so-called extended holiday season. \n\nThe forest itself is cool. I mean, fuck, it is kinda cold here. It can feel cold if you are not used to being outside. (Why don't people go outside anymore?) \n\nThe trees were plentiful. Where was the Penn & Teller (Penn Jillette) tree though?  The Blue Man Group 'tree' seemed to be the most interactive and sensorily drawing. Caesar's Group seemed to have the most real estate leased from OV for their installments. Every corporation/company involved with sponsoring this event deserves recognition, but I only have so much time (and available characters). \n\nTake the time to walk the entire forest; think of MF as a freebie that is given for donating to the parent charitable organisation. - E"
1,Thank you for sharing your opinion about Paranormal. I ll keep doing my best to improve your experience.
1,Super cool spot to get some java and check email. Great prices locally owned. Very cool art work that switches out every month.
1,Awesome Hawaiian style food and great salads!!!! The salted caramel chocolate coconut bark is so good!! The burritos are great and it is so easy to order. Great place to stop on our road trip. We will defiantly go to this restaurant again when we drive through Las Vegas and the staff was so friendly! 5 stars!!
1,"Although the spa can be a bit pricey, I had the best massage/float! The massage therapist was great and I got his name to be sure to request him next time I go. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The facility was very nice. Its not the Ritz, but the facility is clean and what it lacks, the staff makes up for. I'll be back!"
0,"So happy they got their liquor license back but wish the bartender/ server knew what a Cadillac or perfect margarita was. Had to order from the margarita menu & buy an extra shot of tequila to offset the strong sweet  sour mix. They have the best smooth/ taco sauce but not provided. Chips were cold like out of a bag. I requested extra garnish with my red chili burro, barely got normal amount but didn't get a chance to ask for more, she dropped food and left quickly and did not see her again until we were done. There were 2 occupied tables, maybe she was busy doing side work. I have been to the other Manuel's locations and the service and food is always great."
0,Michelle King : equals : Rude. Cold. D terrible customer service skills.  Forewarning to all.   What a nightmare.  Just plain bad experience.
0,"Used to quite like the atmosphere in Orocco Pier. It was a semi-regular haunt for me on a visit to South Queensferry, what with the nice view and warm and cosy space complete with some couches and newspapers. \n\nHowever, I hate to be a moan but on my last visit to this place on New Year's Day I was charged \u00a35 for two mugs of tea. Originally they were meant to be presented to me in paper cups but I objected to the idea that I'd sit in at a restaurant and get served hot drinks in paper receptacles. The barman could tell I was peeved and offered to decant the cuppas into mugs. Upon discovering the \u00a35 cost I almost didn't pay for them. I hate being ripped off!! I recognise it was New Year's Day, but come on guys. Five quid for two teabags and milk? It wasn't even table service - I had to sort out my teas at the bar. Grrr.\n\nSo, boo to the Orocco Pier. I won't be back. There are plenty other lovely places in South Queensferry that can take my money instead."
1,"Have been here a few times and have loved it every time!  Great food, great beer selection, great patio! Please support this restaurant! They support our running group's activities throughout the year and we plan on going back as often as possible."
0,"US Airways is the bottom of the pits.  I would not fly this airline again even if I was given free airfare.  Spare yourself the experience.  Move along, fly United, fly Frontier...or drive.\n\nAvoid at all costs."
1,"Your own review of this place will come down to what you like. I like good drink prices and a nice dance floor, so this place has a good start in my book. \n\nI've been here on a Thurs-Sat night and it's always a good time. On Thursdays the upstairs dance floor is closed, and there is a mobile DJ set up on the first floor. It can be a drag if nobody is out, but there are plenty of tables and seats at the bar to keep you comfortable. \n\nOn Fridays and Saturdays this place really packs it in. The dance floor seems to be built on a weak foundation because it bounces up and down. Not necessarily a bad thing; I think it's rather cool. The wait time for drinks is average and the bar staff is friendly. \n\nMy only gripe against this place is the first floor restroom. Every time I've been there, there's been an inch of water (I hope that's water) on the floor. Clean that stuff up."
0,"Horrible experience! I went there to try to have dinner and watch live flamenco for my birthday last night. I was my first time there and I was really excited because I read all of the amazing reviews this place has. I stepped in and the place was full which was understandable but my friend and I where literately standing for 15 minutes without being acknowledged. Several servers walked by, stared at us and never once approached us to ask if we needed anything or perhaps to tell us that the place was closing soon because they did have a sold out event right after flamenco which I was aware of before going in. Needless to say that my friend and I where confused, felt awkward, and left very disappointed in the place and we did not even get to try their food!"
0,"If you're thinking of buying anything from this place,  you should read this review first. The other yelp reviews are the tip of the iceberg. When you go into this store, I'm sure you will meet a short little New Yorker who will talk your ear off. About absolutely nothing. His name is Eric (the store manager, which he will tell you over and over) He hired me there a few months ago and I made the mistake of not getting out of there immediately. Early on, I had a customer I was working with one day, and he kept coming over and badgering them. I told him they were thinking of doing financing, and he said \""They don't have any money, get back on the door.\"" Nice. He is easily the most incompetent person I've ever met, and there is a very good chance your order will be messed up in some way. I can't tell you how many upset customers I had because of him messing up something with their orders. \n\nNot that you necessarily will care how a sales person is treated, but this guy continually berates and demeans his sales staff, not to mention how he treats customers. Why the owners put an imbecile like this in charge of an entire store baffles me. If you've purchased from him, chances are you already know he cannot even help how badly he lies about practically everything. We never knew what to expect day to day, what he would lie about, how he would treat us. This is the first time I've ever used the term 'slimeball' to describe someone, but it's just so appropriate. The owners should be embarrassed for having this nitwit working for them. Stay away, it's for the best!"
0,never want to come back
0,"Slow during Sunday lunch, hostess sat us immediately. Hostess was chewing gum and wearing white and pink socks, very visible. Upon sitting our server Maria came over before we completely sat down and asked us what we wanted to drink before we looked at a menu. She left dirty plates on the table. We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, which was great. Ordered the crawfish bread and gumbo, both HORRIBLE. Talked to Maria about the gumbo because it was supposed to be the Shrimp and sausage gumbo but no sausage was in the dish and the server said it doesn't come with it but the menu says it supposed to(very important to know your menu as a server). Talked to a manager Marcalla and she was accommodating."
1,"very nice hotel. very high price tag. i was totally satisfied with everything. extremely friendly and helpful staff...  clean, modern rooms..... the ultimate in luxury in vegas. however, i thought the images on the website were waaaaaaay nicer than the actual room. i thought ours was a little smaller and had less...... ambiance then the ones on the site did. also, it seemed like every single lampshade in our room was crooked. i mean, i straightened them out but... i thought staying here was so expensive because of the ever present attention to detail.. right? that said, i was still pleased with the whole stay. the room service was great, the spa was amazing and the casino is luxe!!\n\noh, but i saw an employee being very rude to a guest. the guest asked an employee where something was (the pool or the restaurant or something) and the employee was like \""uhh, theres a sign right there sir. you need to keep your eyes open or youll always be asking people where you are all the time\"" or something. rude!!!"
1,Love American Eagle Outfitters because it is kind of a one stop shop for me and my family.  I can find stuff for my self and the kids.  If you are a member of their online and email program you get some awesome coupons and that really helps with the prices which I think I wouldn't pay unless I had the coupons ( I am a coupon shopper for sure!).  \n\nThe reason I didnt go all out and go 5 stars for this location is for customer service.  They always seem short handed.  I am always searching for someone to let us in the dressing room or standing in a pretty long line to make a purchase..that seems a little odd in such a small location.
1,One of the coolest places I would've never expected to find in Uptown Charlotte. Feel like I stepped off Church St. and into a little corner of the Emerald Isle. Definitely worth a visit. Grab an irish pint in this cozy pub and enjoy some good darts or soccer on the tv.
1,"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. \n\nFinally brought my clubs down from DC a few months ago. I've been to Leatherman 4x since. I love it. It's clean, has an upper and lower deck and a terrific clubhouse with a great selection of gear and refreshments (BEER!). The staff is really friendly too.\n\nThe prices are good too. And once you dump the balls in you'll never have to bend down and place them on the tee. You can even electronically adjust the height of the tee.\n\nIt's a fun place. The only downside is that it can get pretty crowded due to it's awesomeness, so be prepared to wait on a nice day.\n\nCheck it out. Thank me later!"
1,Man I wish there was a place like this in LA!!!  It's CLEAN! Complimentary fancy drinks and fresh baked cookies. It has mirrored furniture I wanna take home LOL JK. Most importantly seems like an honest place won't add on extras or BS thaturcar is messed up. The prices are amazing and even more straight forward :) I think I'll have to drive here from LA every time I need any kind of service :)
1,I went here with my boyfriend and his family for his birthday-June '08. \nGood food as expected but damn...hella expensive! Peppered Crispy Shrimp for $26? \n\nDessert was very yummy! I forgot exactly  what I ordered but it was chocolate and again-yummy!\n\nIf your looking to splurge for Chinese food...this is the place to go.
1,"A year and a dozen additional visits to AquaKnox.  I've found the restaurants niche.\n\nAquaKnox is one of the best places to chill, have a drink or two and a lite dinner or pre-dinner snack for the progressive dining crawl.\n\nSure, the mains are excellent.  The fish is always perfectly cooked and accompanied by sauces or sides that accentuates the natural flavor of the fish.  Simplicity at its best but (and I can't believe I'm going to say this), the food does NOT match the ambiance of the restaurant.\n\nThe decor is modern and chic.  There is a lot of energy and noise from people waiting for the Blue Man Group theater to open, leaving the convention center, or simply walking between the Venetian and the Palazzo.  All together, it is not conducive to sitting for two hours enjoying a meal.\n\nSo, focusing on the starters; the in house smoked selection fish is hard to beat.  It usually includes generous slices of trout, salmon, and outstanding sturgeon that rivals that of Petrossian (with an upturned nose; the gold standard that I measure all smoked fish against) .  A touch of creme fraiche and a toast point.  Hard to beat simplicity.\n\nThe raw / chilled bar does not offer a huge selection but what they have is very fresh.  The Jonah crab claws or jumbo stone crab claws (when they are in season) are outstanding.\n\nGrab a seat at the bar or the lounge.  Enjoy the energy.  Enjoy the food.  Enjoy the drinks.\n\nRecommended"
1,"Everything here is perfect- the atmosphere, the knowledgeable wait staff and of course everything on the menu.  It's the best sushi I've had away from the coast and better than a lot that I have had on the coast.  Tuna belly melts in your mouth, the cook yourself waygu beef is unbelievable and really everything I've ordered there the past 3 times has been amazing.  It's the best, most unique, delicious, & fun restaurant I\""ve eaten at in Vegas or in most states & countries.  I don't know how they do it in the desert, fresh fish and all, but it is, and it's amazing.  Trust me, go."
0,Went with 4 friends.  After we were done we bet how long this place would be open?   All our food came at once.  So the appetizer and our soup got pushed aside. The staff was very dumb and didn't care how long empty plates and bowls stacked up.  I give the food 4 out of 10....  Go home hungry or just hit Millers or the Yardhouse!!!!
0,"STILL haven't heard from manager Kevin.  Will keep experience short.  Planned a surprise party for friend, we all work in the area.   34 RSVPd and 42 showed.   I got there early to decorate, 6/30 event date.  That night's manager greeted me and gave me choice of area.  Tables were set for 6 but only fit 4 comfortably.  Eyes rolled when I mentioned this, was told these were designated for us.  When more showed up, as often happens, better more, than less, I was told we could not overflow to empty tables.  Are you kidding me! Treat them as walk-ins and take their order.   One waitress commented, \""That's why I hate working these events.\""    I thought the objective was to work for tips with good service.  When one person finally got waitresses attention, \""You want another one ?\""(beer) she'd had only one.  I could go on and on, but don't want to get irritated again.  AND an 18% gratuity was was added to everyone's bill. Many had to wait unreasonably long for food and service and felt gratuity too much.  I never sat down as I was trying to keep folks calm and happy.  The food was fair, nothing special.  I plan work gatherings often in the area, last one here.   Many of the guests live nearby and said they would not return.   South Phx. has many choices now, will book with them.  I called Kevin several times prior to event to make sure all was in order.  I've yet to hear back from him after event.  I've even emailed him on website saying, perhaps he'd like to call for feedback before I Yelped.   Crickets.    May be okay for a group of 4, not able to handle a large group.   Bartender started waiting tables and was very rude.   Need a steak house?   I've used Rustler's Rooste for 45 and have only compliments.   Yeah, my event was T-Boned, crashed with Terrible service."
0,"Hmm... I'm not really sure how to feel about Oasis, whenever I pop in I always leave feeling rather uninspired. The window displays are usually very nice and I also like Oasis bags which come with the Oasis logo and a flowery pattern but the fact that I prefer their bags to their clothes is probably not a good thing.\n\nI'd put Oasis in the same category as the likes of Wallis and Dorothy Perkins except it's twice as expensive. I'm not really sure how they get away charging so much more than other High Street stores, particularly when it's never exactly bursting with customers.\n\nOasis is just very twee and everything is either quite frumpy and mumsy or very low cut and a little bit trashy looking, it's not really my bag. It's really boring. It also seems quite confused itself, who exactly are Oasis target audience? Sack the stylists!"
1,"I love this bar and am fortunate it's nearby my house. They have several tv's, a couple pool tables, skiball, and the best, I repeat, BEST, burgers in town. They may be $8-10, but they're worth every penny."
0,"My buddy and I ended up here exploring the cosmopolitan hotel and casino. We just ended up here as most others places had a line up.\nMenu is straight forward and interestingly the servers speak with an Italian accent :) Ah well its Vegas after all. \nWe ordered a Grilled Filone, Duck Egg & Fonduta to share, I ordered a braised short rib and my buddy ordered a Prosciutto, Arugula & Parmigiano Pizza. \nThe food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  \nThe appetizer was expectantly rich as the duck egg added a nice layer to flavors.\nUnfortunately the good stuff stopped here my short ribs were below average and were not falling apart as I would expect them to be. No rich layers of taste just plain. \nMy buddy found his pizza to be extremely salty and actually left most of it. \nWe paid a decent amount of money here and expect better."
0,"Dirty, dank, stinky cars.  One pretty good customer service rep working tonight, one really bad one.\n\nThe girl at the counter is rude, huffy, rolls her eyes at me, attempts to argue with me.  Almost comedic in nature.\n\nAside from the foolishness of the one cranky agent who should be replaced, the cars are dirty- very dirty, and they smell.  \n\nThe experience I had today does not fit into the Hertz brand image nor does it reflect well on the businesses that refer to this location. \n\nThis place needs to get secret shopped badly.\n\nI forgot to mention the tag on my rental car is expired as of June 2014.  So, yea, no one is taking care of the cars, expired tags plus dirty cars makes me sure no one is paying attention."
0,"Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE."
0,"First off, I'm not one of those two star reviewers. You know the kind: \""It cost so much!\"" \""I don't get the food, I like hamburgers.\"" \""This place is too fancy, so here's your one star.\"" That's not me. I am a foodie. Check my other reviews for proof. So, given this disclaimer here's my two cents on L'Atlier...\n\nOne word: \nHalf-assed.\n\nPre-game:\nOur group of nine ate here this last weekend. I made reservations in advance. They required a $75 reservation fee (non-refundable and not applied to the meal) . That's a first. And because we were a large group we were limited to tasting menus only. Fine. Ain't no thing - this place is #2 on Yelp. I'm excited! I love food!\n\nThe experience:\nWe were smashed into the wall. There was not enough room to get into our seats. Once the table was moved so all the ladies, in their lovely dresses, could shimmy in, they were trapped - the whole meal - full bladders and all. The service sucked. They already had their guaranteed 20% gratuity (because of our party size). So, we endured a meal full of empty glasses, missing silverware, and a wonky table.\n\nThe Food:\nAverage. We had two vegetarians with us (the restaurant knew about this ahead of time) and when the amuse arrived they were served foie gras mouse. You can't take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter? Two of the courses (in a row) had the same pesto sauce. Not a big deal, but the primary components were so bland all you could taste was pesto. \""Sir, for your fist and second courses this evening you will be having pesto.\"" Come-on! Most of the dishes were one note. In general the meal was uninspired. \n\nIn summary:\nWe left disappointed. Michelin should revoke their one star. I know it's harsh, but it's truth. Do you hear me, Bibendum?"
1,"I have a very entertaining experience at the Sushi Room that I will gladly tell while keeping names private (so as to not piss anyone off). Note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so I don't know if their staff is still the same. Phew\n\nSo my date and I show up really late on a Thursday night. The place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar. We order a couple sake bombs, 2 rolls (spicy tuna and a salmon roll) and some korean-style ribs. The sushi was pretty tasty (very standard, nothing out of the world) but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat. Still, it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night, so we were pretty complaisant with our choices. They had a couple choices of sake which I appreciated, so we went with the drier (less sweet) option. With HH prices, it ended up being about $25 for the both of us. Pretty darn good. \n\nHalfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it. Don't get me wrong, it was freaking hilarious. Then, another staff member (not our actual server) invited my date and I next door to the Living room, where she proceeded to tell us her life stories and flirt with all the owners. (Sushi & Living Room are owned by the same group of people). Needless to say we had a great time, but it was all incredibly random. Their staff was fun. They kept it moderately professional while we were eating and enjoying our alone time... then let it all loose when their shift was over and we had paid our bill. Lol. What can I say, I love the restaurant life."
0,Absolutely the worst pho establishment I have ever been to. Extremely rude server- she shouldn't be working there. A couple actually left before even ordering- we should have followed them. The pho was good don't get me wrong- but in the service industry- service is everything!! Don't waste your time or money at a place that acts like they don't even want you there.
0,"I'll go back if my friends want to have a drink but if it's to eat, no thank you.  We shared nachos and chicken skewers.  My bad that I didn't read the description of the chicken skewers--I thought it would be like satay but it was previously frozen breaded chicken fingers on a stick.  The chicken part was flavorless.  Nachos were the worst I ever had since they were all completely stuck together.  It made it hard to take some out in order to spread the toppings around--the flavor wasn't inedible but it wasn't good either."
1,"I love this place so much.  Thomas is motivating without being scary and I'm doing things I never thought I could. The people here are truly amazing, welcoming and encouraging.  I was totally out of shape when I started less than 2 months ago and I still have far to go but I feel so amazing now.  Don't let the difficulty of Crossfit intimidate you. Drop in for a class and you'll be surprised what you can do and how much you can enjoy pushing yourself!"
1,the New yorker is the most amazing sandwiched I've ever had
1,"The Wee Boulangerie is cutely and aptly named - small and perfectly formed. \n\nKatia's breads are just gorgeous - the country style loaf had a deliciously light sourdough flavour, and the raisin bread is seriously amazing. Katia recommends the raisin with a strong, sharp Cheddar - and what a perfect match that would be. I had it plain with salted butter and it is fabulously moist, with beautiful fragrance and flavour. Loads of raisins. Utterly gorgeous. \n\nWe also sampled an artichoke and anchovy fougasse, and a chorizo and cheese fougasse - the strong flavours of the filling matched the Provence-style bread perfectly.\n\nI also tried a blueberry tart - so many blueberries, and what IS it about French baking that lends itself to those effortlessly delicious not-too-sweet tartlets? This is beautiful baking!\n\nThe Wee Boulangerie is a fabulous new business and I wish them every success."
0,"Wife and  recently moved to the area and this was the first place we decided to try as aesthetically it jumped out and seemed fun. That much stayed true, the inside has a great vibe, not that large, and had a live musician playing in a little balcony overlooking the restaurant.\n\nBeyond that the experience was the exact 2-Star definition of  'Meh. I've had better'. It took us almost 30 minutes to get seated, and we were hardly even acknowledged by the wait staff. After being seated drinks took another 15 minutes, and food order was another 20 minutes, and 15+ minutes more before the appetizer came out. Speaking of which, the Queso Fundito was the one thing highly raved about here, yet, ours came out as a luke-warm solid mass of cheese--not the dip-able queso we anticipated. In all, from the time we arrived to the time we left took nearly 2 hours.\n\nThe entrees were ok, I don't really have complaints there other than it may be a bit pricey for what it was (except my wife's burrito, it was huge and only like $8). However, it's likely nothing impressed me because of how irritated I was with how long everything was taking.\n\nOur server (maybe she was a manager?) was trying really hard and did apologize for the wait on everything. She did mention that there was a party of 20 in there which led to the delays. While I can empathize with this, it didn't seem as if this party put the restaurant over capacity of what a busy friday night might normally be, so they should have been staffed accordingly, not to mention we were sat well after they were so the food orders were plenty staggered.\\\n\nMaybe I'll try it again and see if it goes better, we'll see."
0,"This restaurant has been on my bucket list for what seems forever.  The interior is small and dumpy - not a first date destination unless you are trying to send a message.  Staffing appeared to be a husband and wife with one other person in the kitchen.  My wife chose the shrimp wonton soup which was salty and pretty much devoid of flavor though the wontons were good.  I ordered the steamed chicken with mushrooms, Chinese sausage and choy som which was just okay.  We also shared a mango pudding that also was just okay.  Service was good and prices low, but I do not consider our meal a bargain because the food quality and ambiance were below average."
0,"After looking at photos and the menu we were stoked to tryout the unique eats at Little Spoon. The restaurant is located in a quaint spot on Selwyn, next to Mellow Mushroom. \n\nThe menu was limited to a few selections that all sound really great on paper. One interesting item was the cinnamon sugar toast, but for some reason it doesn't have much taste. Maybe it needs more butter. The breakfast sandwich we got was pretty good, but it was very greasy and the bacon was really undercooked. \n\nThe prices are a little bit high here and the environment is kind of cramped for what you get. Reading the menu was the most delicious part."
0,"We went to a Christmas Eve Dinner with the family and I was let down hard! The Cioppino that I ordered for $50 was far from average. I've had a great cioppino and was not even worthy being called cioppino. The broth was like it was out of a can and the seafood was fishy (not fresh), more like frozen crap. Let's just say the entire dinner was a 1 star rating. The bill was over $500 and for what? I expected so much better. A big let down!!!"
1,Wow! It's the best place to buy groceries!
0,"I've definitely had better service. I've definitely had better Johnny's. So, I wasn't that surprised when I didn't have a great experience.\n\nMy Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Shake was superb. I'm talking extremely delightful. The burger on the other hand was a bit meh. Nothing spectacular. Nothing mind blowing. Simply an average burger.\n\nThe service sucked hardcore. I'm not talking Cinemax After Dark here, I'm talking that crazy stuff you come across on the internet that you instantly clear your cache, cookies, and history for. It just was overall absent. I had to actively search out help. I wish they would pay attention to their customers."
1,"Food Quality--5 stars\nPricing/HH Options---3 stars\n\n\n\nWell, this place was a very welcome surprise!  Nook has been on my list of \""must try' places and I finally got there to try it last night.  We got there about 4:30 to take advantage of HH specials and got seated immediately in a cute little alcove just off the entrance.  We sat in some really comfy little club chairs and my dining buddy was in heaven because we had arms on them!  I was in heaven because the place smelled so darned good :).  \n\nWe had several things recommended to us but there were a couple of special items that caught our eye at the same time: poutine and arancini.  We ordered those and had some lovely beverages while we waited.  DB had some wine and it was pronounced delicious.  I was more in the mood for something fruity and cool, so got a grapefruit/vodka concoction that was really yummy.  \n\nThe arancini was the best I've ever had...I've only had it 3 times so am by no means any expert.  The sauce and consistency was really nice and we scarfed them up in no time.   The poutine was the star of the show though; again I'm no expert but was just amazed by the gravy and fries(double fried makes a difference!!!).  The addition of a fried egg was sheer genius!..\n\nWe noshed leisurely and had a couple more beverages AND dessert!  Tracy Dempsey bread pudding!!!  I love it but don't have it very often---it was heavenly and worth the calories.  We also got to meet the chef and he was very sharp, sharing some of his future ideas with us.  \n\nSo, how to get the coveted 5th star?  \n\nA better array of selections for HH would be great.  My drinks were pricey so I can't come as often as I'd like.  Maybe a drink special of the week?  I loved the HH specials we had but there weren't as many selections as I'd like to see.  With a chef of this caliber, maybe testing some things out as appetizers would be great.\n\nTry different spins on the poutine.  THAT is your moneymaker!!!  A breakfast poutine, a southern poutine, a hatch chili poutine, it's ALL good.  (This will move you away from strictly Italian inspired, into the Comfort food category which opens a lot of new doors).\n\nThink about adding to the salad selections (perhaps a salad pizza?).  The selections seem kind of pedestrian and new creations will really help business during the summer.\n\nSpeaking of pizza, BREAKFAST pizza would be a winner,  Egg, gravy, sausage.  Oh, yeah!\n\nWhen we left, I was drunk on great food and delicious grapefruit beverages.  When the bill came, I paid and left a good tip.  I am still thinking about you, Nook, and plan to come back!"
0,Customer service= Terrible. Went there to get my racket restrung and the guy was rushing me and when i asked for help he gave me attitude. I like their selection of Tennis stuff. Sport Chalet has a better environment and staff are way more friendly! I dont know if I will come back here.
0,"Rain was a fucking debacle. I've been going to clubs in Vegas since RA in 2002 several times a year. Ive always called up a promoter and made a reservation for a table earlier in the day and get hooked up. The last few times I have been doing LAX with the same guy and its always smooth. We wanted to hit up Rain this time to see Fabolous so I made the mistake of booking and paying $580 online in advance on Tuesday and was told I would be contacted soon. I never was and waited until 2pm on Friday to look into it. \n\n Big fucking mistake. Don't do it. I wasted 2 hours of my afternoon Friday trying to track down someone who could confirm my reservation. Was bounced back and forth between n9ne group, rain, and eventbrite. The women on the phone from rain were rude as fuck.\n\nI had figured that once they had your money they wouldn't give a fuck what happens next which seemed to be true. Finally got squared away and was seated in a \""VIP\"" area to the left of the stage but the area had a bar in the back that was open to everyone. I'm not some asshole that needs to be behind velvet ropes but if I pay 600 bucks for a table I don't want anyone randomly sitting at it. The whole night there was random people popping up at our table, asking for drinks, asking for smokes, even putting their stank bare feet on the table... We threw our bouncer a 20 for holding it down and he was real cool about it.....our waitress was real cool too. We bought a second bottle for about $520 and were having a good time. Dave Fogg threw down a sick ass set dressed up as Jason (Friday the 13th)....Fabolous was cool but the set was super hard to hear for some reason.  \n\nWhen the club was shutting down we were told we couldn't  bring the last of the Vodka out of the club but the bouncer said if we pay him we could!  Fuck that....We already spent over 1100 on 2 bottles and tipped him 20 bucks to do his job.  Ended up taking the bottle and no one said shit...Rain sucks for the whole VIP set up. Too much of a hassle and not worth the nonsense. I would go again but never pay in advance and would hope we wouldn't be subjected to a fucking bribe. I also lost my fucking iphone there and some scumbag never turned it in."
1,The service is outstanding. I had the Cajun pasta and tortilla soup both very good. My wife had the baked potato which was better than most and a very fresh Caesar salad.
0,"Terrible Pad Thai, smelled and tasted awful. The yellow curry was super runny and definitely not up to par with some of the other places around here. Very disappointed. Will not be returning."
1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. All the rooms are superb!! Great service every time. Anytime I visit Vegas, this is my choice of hotel. This place is fun, intimate, crazy, sexy. I invite friends to visit and their always blown away. I've stayed in the One bedroom studio and plenty of nights in the Wraparound Suite. I hate leaving the place too. It's just something about waking up and heading out to the balcony to take in the scene."
0,"Hi please rape my wallet and then screw me over on customer service and delivery time.  So I ordered a custom white leather sectional from Bassett - I have other pieces from Bassett that were not custom and therefore I received immediately.  The quality is excellent but I AM REELING from my most recent experience here.\n\nWhen I ordered the sectional I paid by check in full up front and was told the order would be 6-8 weeks for delivery.  It has been ten weeks and I was just told it would be another two.  \n\nNot comfortable with this change in events I said I wanted to cancel my order.  They are apparently saying I cant cancel a custom order.  So what if it takes a year????  Am I still expected to keep waiting??  \n\nSo I told April (who works as a sales person or something there)  that they should at least refund my shipping cost or do something to maintain this customer relationship.  She says 'Probably we won't do that, you will have to talk to Carla and we have great relationships with our customers' .  Oh really?  By doing this to them?  And btw Carla hasnt returned ANY of my phonecalls!!!  \n\nShe said 'All custom orders take longer than 6-8 weeks'.  So I said 'Why did Kevin  (my salesperson) tell me that it would be 6-8 weeks then?  Is he new here?'  Of course the answer is that I was MISLEAD KNOWINGLY by the sales staff and once they got my check for nearly $5k they completely stopped concerning themselves with my order.  So yes I feel USED AND ABUSED but lesson learned...sigh.....Please be exceptionally careful with any Bassett store and NEVER BUY CUSTOM FURNITURE!!!!!!  I hate you Bassett!!!  (P.S. I will be honest and update this review if it comes sooner by some miracle from heaven or if they refund my shipping cost.)"
0,New and big yes... but not my favorite spring training park.\n\n5 stars for being big and roomy and also lots of grass in the outfield\n\n2 stars for being almost like a major league park. Feels like you are attending a MLB regular season game. They lost out on the small spring training feel and intimacy.\n\n0 stars for being the only cactus league park I visited this spring not allowing you to bring in food like candy or peanuts or sunflower seeds. You realize why when you see the pricey beer and food vendors inside.
1,"I use the drive-thru weekday mornings and I get a iced sugar free caramel latte. This is the best iced latte I have ever had.  I usually get Starbucks which is a bit towards the bitter side and Dunkin Donuts which is passable but doesn't taste a lot like coffee.\n\nIced coffee at Buzzberry has a great combination of coffee, milk and syrup. A bit pricey though at over $6 for a large.\n\nBut use the $1 with a Yelp check in and get a coffee punch card. You get a free one after 5."
1,"Found this place because of yelpers back at the old location. (may have done a review back then) Now Carlos is back right up the street at the Spectators Bar. Don't let the location run you off. The quality of the food is excellent. You really must try the chicken nachos, finely chopped chicken atop freshly fried tortilla chips with fresh pico and sour cream. YUM!!!\nThe fish and chips were so fresh, no frozen fish here!! Seriously the best fish and chips I have ever had.\nSteamed mussels, oh yeah! \nI wish they would expand or change the menu a bit. I know they are probably a little limited because of the \""bar\"" location and clientele. I will revisit regularly!"

0,"I had a terrible experience here. I dropped off a queen-sized comforter and two decorative pillow shams to be dry cleaned. ($48.00, which I thought was a bit pricey, but it was comparable when I called around, so there you have it.) \n\nAlthough I was told they would be ready in two days, when I called four days later I was told to come the next day. Then, when I got the comforter back I had to go back a separate time for the shams (which I thought had been folded into the comforter; I was not told they weren't there). \n\nAlthough the woman who helped me was courteous and kind, I just wasn't impressed at all with the service. I asked that they put the comforter back into the bag I gave them; they didn't. The cheap bag they gave me fell apart when carrying it into the house. \n\nMaybe my experience was an anomaly, but that's it. Everyone else seems happy with them, so perhaps I need to give them another shot with my regular clothes."
0,"This is my first yelp review. I'm writing this review because: it's not every day that you have your worst restaurant experience ever. Mine happened in this restaurant, Chinatown, Las Vegas. \n1. Dirty - I meant really nasty\n2. No service at all\n3. Foods are not good and expensive. \nDO NOT go to this restaurant!!!!!!!!!"
0,I went to Michael Kors to  shop the jewelry section for a Christmas gift. The sales clerk named Linda took a sentry stance  front of  of me and the jewelry  case and refused to speak to me. Apparently this sales clerk does not consider an ethnic person such as myself a viable customer. I live in North Scottsdale and I'm sure I make more money than a sales clerk.
1,"I went to this place on a weekday to avoid the crowds. the food came out fast as the dim sum ladies are very good and hits everyone table. food choice was excellent. the fried shrimp dumpling was excellent as well as the haw gaw and si mui. the place is very nice and clean , large dining room and easy parking . excellen choice for out of towners"
0,"nothing to rave about this place.\nservice was poor and the food was bad.\nI know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."
0,"By far, the least impressive Cirque du Soleil show I have seen.  The performers are all amazing, but for some reason, it was not showcased or directed well.\n\nWe spent over $130 on each ticket, and we had excellent seats, which were very comfortable, But the show seem to drag on.  The sand artist was really cool and different."
0,"Just visited the HOTEL soon to be renamed Delano...we actually stayed in their all new Delano room, the hotel room itself is well designed, but the customer experience was horrible, and deserved 0 star!\n\nThe check-in took 45 minute when there were only 3-4 parties in front of me, although they are going through with their renovation, this is no excuse for the long wait.  We had specifically booked for a suite with 2 beds, but they weren't able to give us a regular room, so we ended up with a room that was designed for handicapped visitors (restrooms with handle bars).\n\nUpon entering the room, there trash left over from the previous visitor (unfinished drinks left on the table), and then the rest room there were half-washed glass cups (cuts with foams and not yet rinsed)....obviously someone was rushing to clean the rooms and forgot everything.\n\nFollowing morning, we requested for housekeeping by pushing the housekeeping button, but NO-SHOW, no housekeeping, we had to call again only to get a disgruntled cleaning lady who was very unwilling to come in and clean. After cleaning the room, and leaving, they left their cleaning detergents in the room.\n\nOverall, a very very poor customer service/experience for a very expensive room."
1,One of my favorite spots in LV!! Ya gotta try it at least once!
0,"The LOBSTER shrimp ceviche had ZERO lobster. When I mentioned this to the manager she said \""ok\"". Wow great customer  service. I'm giving 2 stars because the ceviche did taste good and so did the garlic fries but I can get those anywhere.

1,"I called Noble Cleaners to clean my living room carpets and couches.  When Sam answered the phone she was able to give me an exact quote and schedule a time around my schedule to get the guys out.  Gene and Ryan showed up promptly at our scheduled time and immediately got to work.  They took the time needed to clean my cushions and couch and then pressed straight on to the carpets.  Gene was able to tell me about different types of cleaners and even about stain blockers and how they really work.  I will recommend Noble Cleaners for all my cleaning needs to anyone.  Hands down the best carpet, tile, wood, and upholstery cleaners in Las Vegas."
1,"Being a man who just recently lost a ton of weight (and clothes sizes), I am in need of a new wardrobe. I am now in full \""purchase mode\"" and procuring the best shirts, polos, pants, etc, all at the best price. I heard about Rack a couple times, and thought \""Meh, if they have nothing, I only wasted about 10 minutes of my life.\"" Well, lets just say this place is outstanding! Lets run our hands through the Pant aisle at full speed, and discuss Nordstrom Rack:\n\n~What to do~\nBuy buy buy clothes, shoes, perfumes, accessories, etc... ALL at significantly marked down prices.\n\n~The Good~\nTHEY HAVE PENGUIN! I love....love...love this brand. I am not a clothes person persay, but holy God I love this brand. They have it marked way down, at prices which allow me to comfortably stock my closet. The prices for all the designer clothes, for that matter, are outstanding. I was giddy with excitement looking at all the magnificent deals. Everything I got was at least 50% the normal dollar  rate in regular stores or online! I picked around and was able to come out of the store with everything my heart wanted. The selection is outstanding and they do not skimp on the name brands or styles. Everyone is accounted for, and the styles are not the slightest bit garish. Also, service is fast, even with long lines. They are efficient with your time spent in the store in mind. \n\n~The Bad~\nAlthough they are still marked down, the shoe selection is still pricey. I do not suggest buying the shoes, you can go online or to a shoe store to get better deals. Maybe try on the shoes you are looking for, but put them back and save your money. The jeans are also pretty expensive. I am not a jeans guy, so the dollar amounts for the jeans seemed excessive. I am pretty sure I can get the same quality jeans for a quarter of the price somewhere else. I obviously can't vouche for the womens side, they have a ton... so no comment there. That really covers it, not too bad if you ask me.\n\n~The Down Low~\nAll this said, there are many places to get marked down clothes at. I did my homework, the prices here beat markdowns online and even on E-bay for my Penguin brand. The same goes for a lot of brands, I am sure. For designer styles at marked down prices, this is the perfect spot, and its so close to my place. As for my 4-star rating, the strong variety of options, good looking clothes, large list of designer brands, and the quick efficient service keeps this place with a high rating. The poor prices on shoes and jeans knock a star off. I highly recommend shopping here. Why waste your money with markups!?! Come here, and enjoy!"
0,More management!!!!!!!!! Horrible service. Crappy DJ. Bathrooms are disgusting!!! Sound quality is poor. Unfriendly. I would give this place a big fat ZERO!!
0,"When I walk in a water store, I expect it to be prestine and smell fresh. Not this place! This place is disgusting!  Mold on the wall by the water faucets. Eeewww! All the candy is over priced. The ice cream tastes terrible. I will NEVER come back here. They should change the name to RUDE N NASTY."
0,So slow!! The staff was really slow and more busy talking about what they were gonna do over the weekend then hurry and bring patients back... I hear they have appointments... I will do that next time and see how long it takes....
1,"Ahh Pin Kaow. Now I have been going to Pin Kaow for years and the customer service has always been a hit and miss.  The food though always satisfactory.  We visited Friday night with the wonton soup hotpot in mind....because I had been sick I thought that the soup would be good for my sore throat.\n\nWe did call ahead.  Alway recommended because this place gets busy.  It always seems to have people waiting outside on the weekends.  When we got there we were seated almost immediately even though alot of people were waiting-thats why I recommend the call ahead.\n\nWe ordered the wonton soup hot pot.  If you havent had the hot pot before it is a pot with a hole in the middle where they light a running flame.  I would say its for two people but probably could feed four.  The first time I had this I was so impressed.  It just sets an ambiance...an experience.  You definitely must try it.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Probably the best I have ever had that I order it everytime I come here.  I order the spicy at an 8 or 9 and never seems too spicy to eat.  Especially if my BF can eat it.  He ordered the mongolian beef.  It is always great too.  It is different from other mongolian beefs I have had....the sauce is more like a gravy consistency.  But it is good.  All paired off with a glass of chardonney and the night was bliss. \n\nThis is a great place for a date, for a group, for a celebration.  It is a Thai experience.  So if you are trying to impress someone it would be a good spot to take them.  Like I said the service is hit and miss.  I do recommend the take out.  They have a little section in the back where they do the to-go orders and I have never had a problem.  In and out.  Food is just as good as eating in.  This place isnt very close to home but I will drive for the occasional Thai fix! ;)"
0,"Poor McFadden's. They have honestly gone down hill. I came here for Happy Hour on a Friday night, and was severely disappointed. Their Irish nachos are the best, but... The service was so terrible I lack the words to express my disappointment. It took forever to have someone take our order, let alone bring us our drinks. We watched as the waitress asked another table if the food we had ordered was theirs. We Didn't receive an offer to refill our drinks, just plopped our food down and walked away. Next we ordered another appetizer. Once again the waiter wandered around the dining room, searching for our table. The poor guy had to go ask someone in the back, then proceeded to give our food to other guests. To top it all off, the worst of the worst. The waitress TOOK FOOD off of THE OTHER TABLE and put it in front of us. Really!? REALLY!?!?! Disgraceful, Let alone disgusting! I will never  give this place my money again. In the words of Doge, \""Such disappoint. Much anger. Wow.\"""
0,Hi.  I'm talking about the one on Peoria and 43rd ave. \n\nThe food was great....service not so much.\n\nEveryone was extremely rude....\n\nCustomers were served on servers timely manor if they were Hispanic (of which I am not)....\n\nVery poor service.  Will not be eating here again.
0,"Just like all of my reviews, I will be honest.\n\nI've been a member here for 5 years.  Not a big fan.\n\nNever, I repeat, NEVER go after 4pm.  For some reason, they have a DJ.  Yes, it is the absolute most annoying thing I have ever experienced at a gym.  Even though you can't hear your iPod because of the DJ, you still need to have your earbuds in your ears to prevent unsolicited conversation from some of the weird members.\n\nbtw - There are a TON of old creepy guys who stare at the ladies.  \n\nBut hey, what gym is perfect?"
1,"No bells and whistles. It's not \""hip\"" or \""pretty.\""  You def feel like you're back in like 1975 working out with Rocky or something.  HOWEVER it gets the job done.  basic hours so doesn't fit crazy lifestyles.  And... super freaking cheap.  $75 for a whole year? Worth it.  The classes are solid.  Everyone is nice.  No one is there to see and be seen which is probably the best part.  You don't feel self conscience.  I could be considered high maitenance every now and then, but when it come sto a gym I'm good with this.  Location is very central too.  And if you love the SF Giants, then you're adjacent to their training facility."
1,"That's a spicy meatball! Or in Gadzooks' case an enchilada. They do enchiladas and they do them very well. There are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada. Tons of different meats, sauces, and veggies to choose from. You could really try a new flavor combination every time you go in. The atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time. They also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your meal very well. The staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and I when we told them this was our first visit. The cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type. \n\nI really enjoyed this place and I am looking forward to trying more of their food in the future."
1,"This place is a must if you're going to Vegas to do the classic \""club/party/drink-all-night-with-friends\"" thing on the strip. Or if you like sandwiches/food/life. Even if this place has a huge line, it moves fast and efficient. Just don't expect to easily find a place to sit and eat!\n\nThe condiments and toasting make the sandwich. They absolutely do. I'm usually not a fan of mixed deli meats in a sandwich, but I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS make an exception for the Full Montagu. The toasted swiss and cheddar cheese give the roast beef and turkey such a rich flavor, and the acidity of the deli mustard just cuts through the heavy flavors and tie the sandwich into a perfect little package.\n\nYou can do no wrong with the Original either; roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. The horseradish doesn't overpower the sandwich and is not too spicy - it just gives the sandwich a necessary kick. So good!\n\nNow, I usually LOVE this place and would gladly give it 5-stars, but my last trip was the first time I've ever been disappointed. The disappointment  was with their new side: Bacon Macaroni and Cheese. Don't get me wrong - the macaroni and cheese itself tasted wonderfully salty, rich, and cheesy. What disappointed me was the bacon part. I expected it would be a macaroni and cheese cooked with diced up bacon or something, but when I opened the container, it was 2 slices of bacon (same bacon from sandwiches) placed on top of the mac and cheese and then toasted. Now, I don't know if bacon was cooked with the macaroni (I didn't see any pieces), but it just seemed kind of a lazy attempt to bacon macaroni and cheese. \n\nBut I would definitely go back again."
0,Horrible customer service..Never expect the cab to be in time.. They cannot tell when they can assign a driver and we have been stranded for around 2 hours till a cab finally decides to arrive
1,"We have been here several times with family and for the romantic dinner for two and found both experiences outstanding.  In Scottsdale we often forego inflated pricing for a sub par dining experience not so here.  While you will certainly pay top prices you will also get what you pay for.  Delicious steaks, sea food and interesting appetizers.  Did I say delicious I meant it!  Without doubt one of the best ribeye steak dinners in the valley cooked to perfection, tender and full of flavor and you can choose from 3 or 4 different topping schemes depending on your mood.  Fantastic decor great service need I say more.  If your in Cave Creek looking for a great meal search no further than Cartwrights."
0,"I guess I'm simply getting tired of the hype steakhouse / Vegas Hotel over priced lets put a top shelf name on the door charge exuberant pricing then deliver about 25% of what it is worth.  One of the most disappointing meals in a very long time. \n\n9 Of us for dinner this evening for my birthday and we are seated nicely in the external wine room with a large table.  Asethically pleasing our sommellier gives us some reccomendations from this 500 Plus wine list that is so completely and utterly over priced I can't even begin to believe they have the balls to charge some of these numbers.   OK high rent Palazzo hotel you go with the flow.  A nice Pinot Noir and Super Tuscan are selected as we await our waiter Shep.  \n\nSome friend bread with cheese is presented along with some very nice hot bread with a variety of butters.  Bread has a rosemary type garlic topping very good.  Unfortunately this is where the majority of the meal goes down hill.  \n\nMultiple appetizers ordered Shirmp Ala Diablo $19.00 1 giant shrimp with a piece of italian bread in a spicy marinara sauce.  Specia Beef Cheek ravioli with a cream sauce topped with a drizzle of balsalmic vinegar was different.  An Angoltti was then presented with cream & mushroom..  other end of table had very nice Big Eye sushi tuna cut very thin told fresh.  House salads were ample not lacking in flavor. \n\nEntrees. 3 Veal Chops 2 cooked perfection 1 so fatty it was sent back and taken off the bill $85.00 each for a veal chop good but certainly not $85.00 worth and thats ala carte.   How can you serve a fatty $85.00 chop though? ....  Rib Eye steak again massively overpriced ok but nothing special.  Two veal dishes with musrooms were ICE COLD and had to be sent back.. Came back hot next time but so quickly can't imagine they weren't just nuked.  Pasta with assorted shellfish was fresh if not bland and a bone in Fitlet migon was probably best thing on table.  A non bone in filet and $40.00 lobster tail again COLD you really have to be kidding here. \n\nSide dishes were in short aside from the garlic mashed potatoes a complete and utter disappointiment from the fried eggplant, to spinach with hot peppers BAD.\n\nNice zeppoles and whipped cream for the birthday boy for desert.   Service was on but they simply coulnd't handle how busy they were.  \n\nGoes to show you, put branding on anything and you can sell Ice to Eskimos.  2K with tax and tip when all was said and done, it I have to be honest this was truly an untter and complete disappointment.  Probably worth 2 Stars but with these price points, a veal chop going back, two veal dishes ice cold, a lobster tail and filet cold for all the Zagat ratings, all the clippings and my fellow yelpsters I DO NOT UNDERSTAND all the high rankings.. This is a DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY place that will never see us again."
0,Okay our server was good but seriously my crab legs came with a rubber band in them.  Manager is a fucking idiot came to the table and it was like DOH!  Didn't offer anything not that I was looking but really the proper thing is to offer something.
1,"This is a great spot for breakfast off the strip.  It doesn't have much appeal, but it makes up for it with the food.  The Omelet House has the best banana nut bread hands down.  The omlets and other breakfast items are good, but you definitely need to eat here for the banana nut bread."
1,"Went here tonight for dinner for AZ restaurant week, very good choice. The whole process takes about 2 hours but it is always nice to just relax during the meal. Both my boyfriend and I decided to get the cheddar cheese fondue and the bouillon fondue for the meats. Both very good. We also got the house margarita and a strawberry lemonade. Very good portion size for what you pay for and the slow pace of it makes so that you get full. We noticed that service was suuuuper slow though to get our main meal, but our server took the liberty of taking care of our drinks because of the wait. Great service! Hoping to be back soon to try the happy hour!"
0,"I'm only rating 1 star so that it'll show up on the ratings, if I could rate in the negatives, I would. \n\nI've been to this restaurant before, and while the first couple times it was okay, it was never impressive. I always get Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup), which is okay but not out of this world, still it's a quick fix for Pho when you don't want to make it yourself.\n\nMy bf and I usually go to Asie Moderne which is right across the street from Paris Pho, but he'd never been to Paris Pho and we were in the mood for something different, so we decided to head there instead. Worst.mistake.ever!\n\nI hadn't gone to Paris Pho since they changed their sign, I remember the food being fresh in my previous visits. This was not the case this past Friday (May 2nd 2014). \nI ordered the Pho Ga as per usual and my bf ordered Som Tam (green papaya salad), so we could share, as well as the chicken shrimp pad thai and I ordered the strawberry smoothie.\n\nThe strawberry smoothie was thick, yet quite tasty, the Pho Ga was lacking flavour but at least the ingredients were fresh. This did not seem to be the case for our other orders. Both the som tam and pad thai were disgusting! They both reeked of rotten fish and tasted no better. The chicken and shrimp in the pad thai both tasted spoiled and even the noodles seems to be infiltrated with the smell of rotten fish. What was supposed to be green papaya tasted more like shredded fennel and the spoiled fish taste was over-powering. It was our worst experience ever! \nWe've both had Som Tam/Som Tum before, (never as good as the Tam Som his mom makes - which is the Laotian version of green papaya salad), but we've eaten tasty ones in restaurants before, this was not the case at Paris Pho. \n\nWe both ended up getting food poisoning. Awesome! -_-"
0,"Service was horrible.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were MAYBE 10 tables occupied.  3 bartenders, and 10 servers.\n\nTook 10 minutes after my first drink was empty to get another one and I had to flag the bartender down.\n\nFood was good(that's expected), but took 25 minutes to get an order of orange peel beef and honey walnut shrimp.\n\nI thought San Diego had a lock on snooty, self-absorbed waitstaff, but P.F.

0,"I am so sad that I just arrived to Las Vegas and went to this place! the food was soo bad it saddened me.  Dinner in Las Vegas should be amazing and since I was only staying for one night this was my only dinner!! Ok well right upon looking at the menu of this place I realized this would definitely be a frowned upon meal.  I got the appetizer tower sampler thing because I figured I would get something to snack upon and just eat at a better restaurnt later. Wings sucked, onion rings sucked, potato skins really sucked. the dish came with popcorn out of all thiings. everything tasted like it was previouskly frozen and just heated up, but even still it wasnlt even hot! my parents got a burger (mega double cheeseburger) and sandwhich(california club). the burger looked disgustingly cheesy and greasy and the sandwhich was fine but I wasn't excited to try either. my sister got the clam chowder in bread bowl which was probably the best thing. it probably came out of a can but it was creamy and there were abundant pieces of stuff so not bad, can or no can.  my sisters and I kept thinking \""one star on yelp! one star on yelp\"" the food was really salty too, we saw some other table's order and I swear the chicken pot pie they serve is marie callender's frozen one. someone payed $11.50 for that. On the ONE upside our waitress was really nice.  The food sucked horribly, is in a bad location and scarred me for life.  Please only eat here if you legs are broken and you're right in front of this place...but even still call for delivery or something. Sorry for the brutality garden grill!"
1,"Great tacos and amazing horchata! \n\nThe salsa bar was fresh, and it was really fun to try out different salsas. The Horchata and the Jamaica come in huge cups and are both excellent. I had the Mayan pork and Chicken mole tacos. They were delicious and filling."
0,"This place seriously used to be amazing. I haven't been back here in about 5 years or so, and thought id give it a shot since I didn't want to drive all the way to Khourys. (I'll never be lazy again I swear!) I ordered a chicken dish that was the worst tasting meal of my life. Not one thing tasted good. The chicken was rubbery and so seasoned to the point of being repulsive. Flavorless rice and bland soup. Clearly under new ownership and no continuity. I wish I would have checked the reviews before. $20 later for just lunch for myself ( no alcohol) and I have major food regret. I'm sorry for the harsh review."
1,Lets just say this place is awesome! My sister in law ordered that huge ol' hot dog and shared it with 3 different people. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size. I wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it!  It is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up I would definitely steer clear of this place!!! But fun place to just enjoy a good lunch/drink or two!
0,"I want so bad for BarSmith to be a hangout for my friends and I. It's right downtown, it's got two different dance floors, they play good music, it draws a [supposedly] hip crowd, and they have a rooftop bar.  Unfortunately, they fail on so many levels. \n\nFirst off, to get to BarSmith, you have to walk past a sketch as hell nightclub full of dudes mean muggin you and chicks with skin tight, unattractively short dresses hollerin for attention.  oh yeah, and all of the bums lined up begging for change that harass you until you get to the door. When I walked in the door last night, the foul odor of vomit, piss, sweat, and farts nearly blew me back out. It was almost unbearable.  And the cliche hip hop music, with the DJ's hype man yelling \""All the single ladies let me hear you!!!\"" so all of the guys knew which chicks were horny and available for the picking. Thankfully they separate the two parts of the bar, and we took the stairs to the top to find it completely packed with more obnoxious drunk people.\n\nElectro music banging from the speakers and people were chatting it up. I made my way to the bar, only to discover ONE bartender, and NO MORE CHERRY VODKA. I was substituted SKYY vodka for the SAME PRICE as 3 Olives (?!@#@?#) and redbull brought two drinks to a total of 17 fucking dollars.  Who are you trying to be BarSmith? $8.50 for a redbull/skyy? And the bartender's pouring skills sucked because the drinks tasted awful and were way too weak, not even filled to the top.\n\nAnd to top it all off, there was some creepy as fuck, drunk as fuck, 40-something year old heterosexual white male getting all up on mine and my friends shit, being a drunk fool, and security was nowhere to be seen. I saw a group of guys acknowledging and encouraging his stupid ass drunk behavior as well.  I've been to BarSmith a couple times before, and experienced the douchebagery of a lot of the guys that go here, whether it's discrimination based on sexuality/gender, or just them being plain macho jacked up assholes. It's like the Scottsdale Ed Hardy douche vibe in downtown pseudo-hipster form.\n\nReally, really disappointing."
0,"No breakfast for soccer teams. \nWe were required to stay here for our soccer tournament (pretty typical) but for some reason, even though we booked with a code for out team they didn't have any record of it and therefore we didn't get the breakfast that they were offering for the other soccer teams. \nLike it would have killed them to add us in. \n\nThe rooms are the tiniest I have seen, the pool is small and you are not allowed to eat \""outside\"" food in the lobby or pool area. There are a million signs telling you this. \n\nThe room is clean and it is close to a lot of restaurants. It's close to the Bettye Wilson soccer complex. \n\nI hope to never stay here again."
0,"83 TV's is nice but then it's not so nice. Football playoff's and the half time entertainment had a guy yelling into the mike with the blown speakers : Geeze, back off the mike a few inches at least . As well they did not stop when the 3rd qrt began.\nThe beer: so-so. A fleck of debris in my pitcher & our server was willing to yes her finger to scoop it out.... So no reason to replace the beer \nFood: bar food and eat it sparingly.\nChoose this as when most else is not available"
1,"Figs is the best antique shop in downtown Phoenix bar none.  I moved into a 1920's studio on 7th ave and McDowell and have been to just about every shop in the area looking for stuff to fill it up with.  Figs is by far the most impressive.  Not only do they have some of the coolest stuff from around the world but the prices are reasonable and the service is awesome.  The guys that work there can go on for hours about the stuff they have in that shop.  I would list some of it myself but I wouldn't even know where to start, just do yourself a favor and check it out on your own, even if you're not planning on buying anything at the moment even a visit is a worthwhile experience."
0,"This place USED to be so great, what happened?? The last 3 times we went there we were very unimpressed and have pretty much given up. Each time the service was very slow, the help acts like they are overwhelmed and don't know what to do. But worse of all, the food has become ordinary! Something has definitely changed there and not for the better."

I went to ticket fixers previously ( the pink building) they didn't show up for the court date my ticket went to warrant, it was a nightmare!!!! \n LV traffic ticket guy is the best!!!!!"
1,love this place. really helful and everyone is nice just be patient. Roxanne is awesome she has great customer service and is responsive to emails.
1,"I just want to say that I am writing this review SPECIFICALLY for the service that we received.  I hope that management reads this and recognizes a fantastic employee.\n\nA friend and I recently visited Montelucia to attend one of their 6 week yoga under the stars classes.  We popped in on 11/12/14   (side note, I can't wait until this series comes back in the spring.  It was very enjoyable).  As the class wrapped up, they announced that Centro was featuring a wine & cheese plate special for anyone who wanted to pop in.\n\nMy friend & I opted to head over.  I could see that there was some type of large dinner party (30+ people) for a special event out in the courtyard and then there were a few tables that were occupied in the restaurant, along with 1 party of 8-10 people.  Otherwise the restaurant was pretty empty.  \n\nWe walked in and my only issue was that we were unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated and we weren't really acknowledged when we came in.  We assumed that we could seat ourselves (lack of a hostess stand) and proceeded to grab a small table outside.  We were promptly greeted by our server and brought menus, both for the wine & cheese special and for the restaurant's regular selections.  Our server's name was Christin.  She was bubbly and friendly and immediately made us feel welcome.  We each ordered a glass of wine and a cheese plate (this plate turned out to be quite large and had 3 generous servings of cheese, a large portion of grapes and some crispy flat bread/cracker type things, along with a small bit of green apple).  Our plates were so large and our table so small, that Christin immediately grabbed another small side table and put it next to us.  Although I wish I'd known what our cheeses were, we dug in and thoroughly enjoyed our food.  The restaurant manager stopped by to be sure that we we were well taken care of.  We never lacked for a thing.\n\nThe ambiance was great.  Despite being local, I'd never been to Montelucia and I had no idea how beautiful it was.  The grounds are gorgeous.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  Christin is a gem and I will definitely explore a little stay-cation with Montelucia in the future.  I hope all of your employees are as wonderful as she is.  I was a little sad that the manager was tending to the large party when we left.  I wanted to call his attention to Christin and how great she was.  Turns out that he was busy being a great manager."
1,"This place is amazing. Timothy (Timo as he's known) took care of me. Walking in, I thought I had stopped into Central District in Seattle. Loud hard core gangsta music, guys yelling back and fourth, cranking jokes, seeming oblivious that I was there.\n\nAs we walked in, one barber called to us asking what we needed. Told him we needed a haircut. We sat and as others came and went, seeming mostly to visit, we waited. One customer leaving said, 'the wait's long, but it's worth it'. \n\nMy partner was sat first, then I was next. The guy who took care of me has been cutting hair for 23 years. He was great! Cleaned up my beard, cut my hair, made it all look tight. According to him, I was representing his work. \n\nWithout a doubt the prices were great! I had the \""Cut Above the Rest Experience\"". It was worth every penny. \n\nThis place is a hidden treasure. For the best shave, cut, fade, trim, or whatever this place is not worth missing. In Vegas, you'll pay 3x's more for worse unless you come here.\n\nThanks Timo! Love what you did!"
0,"STAY AWAY FROM THESE RIP-OFF ARTIST.  I moved here within the last year and don't know many mechanics in town.  I have always relayed on my brother who is a mechanic at Mazda to service my Mazda for me.  Before moving here my brother did complete check of my car including changing the transmission fluid at 65,000 miles.  I have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed.  Today I needed to have it done again and thought I would go at lunch by work.  I went online and visited their website and even printed a coupon for a complete oil change for $28.99. No hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said.  When I arrived my car was put in line for service. Approximately 45 minutes later a tech can in to tell me that my transmission fluid need to be changed or it was going to burn up.  When I told him I had it done at 65,000 mile at Mazda, the car only has 79,000 miles now, he said that they lied to me and I should go back and get my money back.  Now who should I believe, my brother of 51 years or this 23 year old kid I just met.  I told him that I would take care of the problem myself and he said again, \""it better be soon, this car might not make it much longer.\""  When I went to pay expecting my bill to be around $30.00 with tax but was informed that it was $35.48.  When I asked the cashier why, she told me that the oil filter is not included in the oil change.  Who does a oil change without changing the filter?  I asked to speak with the manager he was not available.  When I told the tech that I would just pay the bill and not come here again and YELP their business, he said \""DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.\""  So buyer beware of this place, they will rip you off when ever they can."
0,"Total and complete dump.  Bad food and bad surroundings.  The decent servers and chefs are what make me feel bad about the rating, but I'm all about the food."
0,"exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds; the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!"
0,"Wasn't impressed.  Long line outside, and seeing the number of Asians eating inside, I thought it was a good sign.  But after 30 minutes of waiting in line and watching the servers completely fumbling over each other - they were clearly inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing, I knew we were doomed.  But we had already waited that long so we stayed.  From the line, I watched table after table trying to flag someone down because they wanted to pay.  No one would come to them.  I look over to see where the servers are and all four servers, standing together near the cash register looking completely flustered.  Meanwhile, there is a gigantic line outside, which is continuing to grow, and tables are empty and cleared and no one is coming to address the customers waiting in line.  Finally, after about 40 minutes, the man in front of me started to get annoyed obviously by seeing pretty much half the restaurant clear out and no one being seated so he walks in to the four servers standing around the cash register and says something to them.  Finally, one server comes and takes that man and his friend and seats them at the counter.  Then she goes back to standing there - like deer in headlights.  Good grief. Then it was my turn to flag the girl down and tell her that I am happy to sit at the counter as there are empty chairs.  When I tell her that, then she seats us, finally.   I have no idea how long the others continued to wait outside. \n\nOnce at the counter, we ordered, two noodle soup dishes.  it was pretty uneventful and unflavorful.  Maybe it was what I ordered, or maybe it was because they were so busy that they were rushing and not preparing food properly.  \n\nWe ate here because we watched Rock of Ages at the Venetian.   I don't think I would ever come back here again.  For noodles - I much prefer Noodles at Bellagio!"
1,"This is a really nice Macy's to shop at... it somehow feels 'higher' end because it is not organized like the other mall Macy's and because their dressing rooms are spacious, well-lit, and modernly decorated... whereas the mall rooms are like going to try clothes on at Ross!\n\nI found a decent selection of maternity clothes in their itty bitty section of Maternity, so I was satisfied.  The prices were Macy's prices, but they had a coupon you could use for 10% off (unless it was the Motherhood brand... yay for me!.. not!)...  so I didn't get to use it for this purchase.\n\nBesides the very nice decor and layout and modern feel of the Macy's, here were a few things I noted:  The ladies working here were genuinely NICE ladies... very friendly, helpful, talkative, just had a great attitude.  I would come back here over the Chandler Mall just for that :)\n\nPS: they have a Starbucks here but couldn't accept by Gold Card because their system wasn't linked?? :( no Americano for momma."
0,"If you don't have a table here for bottle service, then don't bother.  Went here for Zedd and the line was absolutely ridiculous.  It was all over the place.  No ropes to separate the three lines (Presale, General Admission, Guest List).\n\nI am a guy.  How did I, along with 15 other males, get in before a group of girls (15+) in our group.  I shouldn't complain, but that's just the start.  We waited almost two and a half hours for the girls in our group to come in.  By that time, we were pissed and left.  A COMPLETE WASTE OF $100.  Why?  It was packed and our group was now separated and pissed off.\n\nThe whole Cirque du Soleil thing was really nice.  Added a nice visual aside from all the lights and lasers for your typical EDM club.\n\nWould I come here again?  Probably not."
1,"This is my GO-TO store for all account and phone problems.  I manage 6 phone lines--every one with a different device/insurance or not/data, (you get the picture).  While I try to visit when things are less busy, I have never had less than excellent service.  Reps are patient while we sort out different services, sometimes suggesting ways I can keep my costs lower.  Great store!"
0,"Everyone knows hooters. I love their wings. I really do. They might be the most delicious wings in the world for me.  The pretty sights don't hurt either. \n\nHowever, this location is really bad. Their draft beer is always flat, always, so just get a bottle and save your self the pain. \n\nIt always smells like a bathroom. I think their ventilation system is very bad. Most of the time I choose to be seated outside or as far away for the restroom just because of how much I love the food. Sometimes I just turn away.\n\nHowever, the other day, this location hit a new low when I ordered a bottle of beer, and when I got served the beer, the person serving me was holding a mop in one hand and beer on the hand and served me, asking if need anything else. Upon me saying no, went on mopping the floor. Disgusting.\n\nI can't go to this place anymore. period. I will find a new location."
1,"A friend recommended Bandera to me.  First, point in their favor - they take reservations.  We arrived on time and they seated us right away.\n\nI had heard that their appetizer cornbread was not to be missed and so we ordered it to start.  Delicious in flavor and unique in presentation,  I loved the fact that the cornbread tasted like corn *emphasis-on-the-corn* bread and not corn flavored cake.  The green chilies were a fabulous compliment.\n\nThe prompt service and delivery of our food was the second point in their favor.  I ordered the roasted chicken and the barbeque beef rib with coleslaw and my dinner companion ordered the carnitas sandwich with braised pork and rio grande glaze with a side of the shoestring fries.\n\nMy chicken was moist and extremely flavorful - real flavorful, not the \""we-added-fake-smoke-flavoring-to-the-store-bought-barbeque-sauce-we-slopped-all-over-your-chicken\"" flavor.  One of the three ribs on my plate was a little over done.  I'm all for cooking the ribs until the meat falls off the bone, but please stop when it starts to turn to charcoal. \n\nThe best part of the dinner was the coleslaw and that's saying something, because I hate coleslaw.  It was unlike any coleslaw I've ever tried.  It wasn't a mayo based coleslaw rather it was shredded cabbage with a touch of cilantro and what looked to be fresh spinach mixed with an oil based dressing that had a touch of chili powder.  It was then topped with crushed peanuts.  A savory and unique dish.\n\nBandera's food was deliciously memorable. Its service was prompt and thorough.  I'll be visiting Bandera's  again in the very near future."
0,"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Been here 2 times... Very average.... It seemed similar to food from Del Taco, but on a real plate. Anyone who gives this place 5 Stars, really doesn't know what real Mexican Food is."
1,"My friends and I love gay bars just as much as we love our gays.  I've only been here once courtesy of my gay hubby (no, we're not married but I consider him my hubby...every girl should have 1! ) who told me that they have cheap drinks.  We normally go to gay bars for their cheap drinks and he said that \""the garage\"" is a mixture of fun hogs and buffalo so why not?!\n\nGot here at 10pm on a Saturday and bought 4 mix drinks for $14!!!  That's the price of one drink at a bar/club at the strip!  Unlike those bars/clubs at the strip, these drinks were served in a 20oz glass instead of the normal 8oz strip glass and they are not cheap with the amount of alcohol either! Their shots are just as cheap too!  5 shots of patron with a side of 20oz coke came out to $25.  They don't serve any food but they do have pretzels and you can have as many as you want.  Definitely a spot to drink on one of those nights where you are not in the mood to be surrounded by club-goers."
1,"Been a couple times but last Sunday was nuts! This is a place to see & be seen, foreal! It's a place where you get to see just about everything Vegas has to offer... my wife & I just kick back and gotta laugh at some of the naughty things we've seen here, especially on the dance floor.\nGreat venue but they really shouldn't have placed the DJ booth in-between the dance floor and pool view. It cut off one of the major veins to outside so the side door was one big traffic jam.\nCover is $30 for girls & $50 for guys but you can talk your way down if you got females with you (unless they're fugly!), just see one of the line hosts. Also try to find passes on the strip, which may or may not work. The line is usually long but it moves swiftly and be prepared to WAIT for drinks too. If you find the right spot on the inside dance floor ceiling AC vents will point right at you... find those spots!"
1,"OMG.... I love this place. My mom and I come here regularly. The feature pancakes are always a crowd pleaser! The staff and management are also so nice and pleasant. The food is great and the service is fast! Perfect location, food and staff."
0,"Music was too fucking loud. We even gave money to the DJ to turn it down, and after one song, the volume returned to where you cannot even hear yourself think. DJ Fame was also making homophobic comments, and not to mention the music was terrible. Hookah was okay but way overpriced."
1,"I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.  \n\nEach location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.\n\nThis location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.\n\nThe only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.  It could get fixed.  If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru."
1,"This place seems to be a local favorite. It's tucked away in a strip mall and about a 15 minute taxi ride down the strip. My husband and I were intrigued try this place out and we quickly became \""Rosemary\"" fans. \n\nThey have a nice bar area as you first walk in with high top seating options. We sat here before our table was ready and we were lucky enough to catch happy hour (which goes till 7). The restaurant has 2 different rooms for seating (both connected though a doorway). Depending upon your mood you may want to make a request as to which one you prefer. The dining area with the kitchen in it is definitely quite a bit noisier. \n\nThe evening we went I somehow had a craving for pork. When our waiter told me that their \""12 oz. double cut grilled pork chop\"" was his favorite I couldn't resist. It's the only item on the menu that has been consistently on the menu (since the restaurant opened 12 years ago.)  Even after I had the last bite I was still craving it.  My husband ordered the risotto starter and Tasso crusted salmon. Both were delicious. \n\nEntrees are pricey here ($37 range). They also offer a chef tasting menu ($80) and a fixed prix menu ($55). \n\nService overall here was exceptonal until the very end. Once we received dessert the waiter neglected to clear our dishes. Despite that lack of attention still a good experience."
1,Awesome burgers! Kids love it that we had to grab some more in LA on the way home. A little bit pricey than a typical burger but worth it. Wish they had one in the Bay Area.
0,"Okay, so the food was actually pretty good in my book. Some things were overpriced ($12 guacamole), and some things were tiny ($9 gorditas), and some things were different than the waiter described ($9 tortilla soup), but the overall experienced was made TERRIBLE by the SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW service. \n\n45 minutes to bring the food out. Really? Not when the restaurant is 1/2 empty...unacceptable Diego."

0,"We walked in and placed an order for two smoothies to go.  15 minutes later I received one of them, and five minutes after that the second.  These were right off the menu with no deviations.  Since we had already waited 20 minutes for a SMOOTHIE (ridiculous) we left in a hurry on our way.  We should have tasted the smoothie in the store.\n\nThe first one, Tropical Thunder, tasted just fine, if not a little overly sweet.  The second one, a Screamcicle, was TERRIBLE!  How much ice do you need to use?!  We were crunching on ice pieces in the smoothie and there was absolutely NO FLAVOR!  I would have had no idea this was supposed to be orange flavored, let alone have other ingredients.\n\nThe sugar and additives make this place on par with Jamba Juice, but at least they have consistency.  I will not be returning to waste more money at this place."
1,"So we got to come here for their VIP night last week and being I had never been here before it was a nice surprise. We weren't sure what to expect but you started out in the club room with johnny depp and george clooney, a good start! They served appetizers and drinks, had a DJ and plenty of places to sit.  There was a picture opportunity as well but as with one or two others I wasn't sure with who the figure was supposed to be.  (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars).  As you continue room to room there is a different theme, different appetizers were served based on the theme and drinks to match.  there were about 4 different places to get a professional photo op and we had fun posing as some had props.  Each guest got a picture to take home as well which is a nice momento.  We each also got a Madame Tussauds small bottle of sparkling wine to take with us.  \nThere were plenty of fun moments throughout the night but the 4D superhero movie was probably our favorite part.  Its only 10 minutes but it was quite fun and entertaining.  Thanks to yelp for this opportunity and a night filled with memories that continue to make us laugh."
1,"Friendliest Wendy's I have ever been to.\n\nVery clean.  Fast. \n\nNo complaints.  Great staff, great fast eats."
1,Great atmosphere and the service was excellent.  The food and drinks were excellent.  Great spot to go to for happy hour.

0,This company are complete thieves charged my account twice and also did to a friend on another location!! Very unprofessional!
1,"Decent sized venue with many options. Though it was a bit of a challenge to find a black jack table that wasn't too full or too expensive, they do exist here. The dealers seemed capable and friendly. The bevs came by with some regularity. \n\nThe Rewards Program is a question mark to me as I signed up rather close to the end of the official day. So, I had almost no time to accrue anything to then trade in for a chance at a prize and other excitement. Ah well. \n\nThere were some bands playing there -- one in an exposed lounge, and another in what appeared to be a theatre. \n\nThe smoke quotient? Not horrible, but still noticeable to some degree."
0,"The entire vibe of this place just felt \""off.\"" The dancers seemed unhappy to even be there. The private dances seemed more like an opportunity to milk as much money as possible from the clientele. Oh, and there's a cover every night for some unknown reason."
1,"First time customer today.  It is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great.  Large portions, fresh bread and cheap..."
0,"Very Disappointed.  Came in to grab lunch, a wrap to go.  What I got was a naan with a few teaspoons of chicken and chutney...for $7!!  They didn't even give me a bag to carry it home in.\n\nWill not be returning.  I see the good reviews, and all I can think is that people haven't had good Indian, or perhaps the sit down experience is much better than the to-go."
0,"Maybe 2.5 stars. I have experienced better from a martini/jazz bar. On a Saturday night, Sydney's was way understaffed. We sat (on the sofa's to the right of the entrance doors where there's a small partition/wall that keeps anyone sitting there from seeing the band) for a good 35 minutes before anyone came over to ask for our drink orders. I actually got up to go to the bar a couple of times (not being able to get the bartenders attention) to order a drink and get a menu. There was a waitress who walked by our group of 6 many times to a table behind us to service them without ever looking our way. We finally were able to order drinks and it took another 30 minutes to get our drinks. Martinis=juice with a splash of liquor so I always stick to my regular tonic. Can't speak to the specialty martinis personally but my guest noted that they were just \""ok\"". I ordered the chicken quesadillas and they were actaully pretty good for whay they were. Two of my guest ordered a bottle of wine to split. After the wine was poured it was placed on the table. Isn't a bottle of wine/champagne usually kept chilled in a bucket? No big deal, our waitress Nicole was knowledgable about the wines and cocktails on the menu and that was a good thing. After we were asked if we wanted a second round of drink, we never saw our waitress again amd had to wait for a while to get our checks. The band was good, can't remember their name. Would I come back? Probably not."
1,"I had an amazing time here at coconuts! My family & I went in last night & tried the \""mexican sampler\"" which had a little bit of all the appetizers! The food was incredible & the service was superb. I saw a few of the managers walking around asking how the service was. I am thoroughly impressed with my experience here & will definitely be back!!!!"
0,"We have been taking our Yorkie to Caspers for many years.  The owner always seemed kind until today.  My husband picked her up after an unusually long time to find a shoulder puncture wound and a large, full thickness open wound to her front leg.  The owner lacked compassion and remorse for what had happened.  I have never seen such cruelty first hand and her lack of caring not just about my 16 year old dog but about her reputation as a groomer speaks volumes.  I had a $100.00 vet bill not to mention the suffering of my little dog after going to Caspers pet grooming.  The vet said they haven't seen a grooming injury this bad.  My little dog has 5 staples to her leg and dermabond to mend the shoulder laceration.  It's really sad for our family, especially out little kids to see and cannot understand such cruelty.  I would not recommend this groomer.  She never even said she felt bad. Now I know why this visit took so long, she had to wait for the bleeding to stop before she called us to pick her up. Horrible!!!"
0,"Slow slow slow\nIt's mostly Sysco and Shamrock Service food, ya know flash frozen then thrown in a deep fryer, then some 'specials' but they're competing for the lunch business of Vermont Sandwich Company next door.\n\nDuring the day and weekends you have the 'regular' Off Track Betting clients and evenings it's so hard to find a freaking parking spot. It's 'Cheers' of East Scottsdale, all locals and hard to break into their 'clique'. \n\nLast Friday their toilets were backed up and no one could use them (had to go over next door to use their competitors, who were sympathetic & friendly), I thought as a health code violation you had to close your doors over this.\n\nBut if you only have one hour for lunch and plan to go, be prepared in a slow slow afternoon return to work."
0,"Tourist trappy place (as you'd expect) in Old Port.\n\nWe had three kinds of poutine (Italian sausage, mushroom onion, shredded pork) and a smoked sandwich with fries\n\nPoutine was okay; nothing special.  Ditto the smoked meat. The fries with the smoked meat sandwich were cold (maybe they are always able to upsell to poutine and that heats them up?)\n\nWe were initially seated at a table adjacent to the bathroom. The bathroom is nasty. Really nasty, and the smell wafts into the small dining area when the door is opened. Not good for the old appetite; know what I'm sayin?\n\nBright side: the beer was cold."
1,"These brownies are as good as it gets.  As I've stated else where, the best on the planet.  Variety of product and product size is excellent.  The packaging is top as well.  Wouldn't expect anything less from this fine organization, that has earned my business over a dozen years ago.  I hype 'em up any chance I get and refer family/friends/colleagues along the way.  \n\nTrust me...get 'em!"
0,"Sushi was okay.  Nothing special, but a little better than Little Tokyo.  Bartender was rude.  Made my French Kiss martini incorrectly (I watched as he poured an imitation chambord liquor).  Hiachi was okay.  Soup was way too salty.  Salad was good.  The chix and steak were pretty good.  Service was horrible.  Had to pass all used dishes to the waitress across the grill.  Will not hurry back."

0,"Where to start?\n\nThere were approximately 20 of us in our group, and we had called earlier in the week to make a reservation - since we knew it was a special occasion, a friends birthday, and we knew when, where, and approximately how many people would be there.  \n\nWhen we got there, they had given our tablyone sat down.  One of my friends was separated from the peoplee to an earlier birthday party who \""still hadn't left yet\""... and, by the looks of it, weren't planning on leaving any time soon.  Good for them, I wouldn't want them to rush, but the establishment should have planned a little better or figured that birthday parties/large groups would take longer.  That was frustrating, but they eventually sat us...\n\nHowever, when we get to the table... the \""table\"" is 4 spots too short... and the waiters are obviously irritated we are there.  Those of us that could, plopped down in a seat to get out of the way of the waiters... well, little did we know that was our \""seat\"" for the rest of the night and we weren't to move.\n\nThey brought us another table or two to add on and ever in the group she knew - so everyone moved down so she could sit by people she knew.  This was while everyone was getting situated, drink orders were just being started, and WAY before we ordered food... however, one of the waiters decided to be a total prick about it and cause a scene about us \""moving\"".\n\nWell... if you would have counted how many guests there were and set up the table in the first place, we wouldn't be moving... you rushed us to get seated so we were out of your way - now you should just DEAL with one person moving.  Not to mention, making a scene made all of us uncomfortable.\n\nI looked over the menu nothing looked particularly appealing (in fact, the menu is SOOOO unoriginal) - so I asked the waiter two questions - 1st, what the most popular dishes are, and 2nd, what he would order.  I took his suggestion and ordered the Combination Fajitas = Big mistake.\n\nMy steak was charred to the point where the \""char taste\"" is all I could taste.  The shrimp was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The skillet that the meat came on was hot, but there was so much liquid on it that it didn't sizzle and the meat was luke warm (at best).  It came with white rice (yuck)...and black beans.  The black beans were the best part of this whole dish...and the sad part, is that they were just regular old black beans with a little cheese on top.\n\nAfter I had tried to choke down 1 fajita, I decided I was done with the dish.  After everyone was done eating, the waiter came and asked me if I wanted a box.  He never asked me how my food was, how everything was tasting, if he could get me anything during my meal... just could he get me a box?!?!  Why would I want a box for burnt steak and cold shrimp??????\n\nNot to mention, after I finished my greyhound, I ordered an ice tea - and after finishing my first (and only) ice tea - he never asked me if I wanted more or came around with another Tea - in fact, I couldn't get his attention to even ask for another ice tea!!!  \n\nI spent over 45.00 on a meal and a couple of drinks and I received about 1.00 worth of service and mediocre (at best) food.  With all the good options and unique restaurants in the valley - it's safe to say this place is crossed off of my \""list\"" as far as places I will eat again."
0,"This is one of my \""miss\"" food adventure. Too bad because it was a belated Father's Day brunch for my dad. We still enjoyed it in good spirit, as nothing is direly bad - like fly in the food or we came down with food poisoning - none of that.  What we did though, me and my dad, for a good part of the time spent waiting for our orders was discussing how the decor of the restaurant missed the theme by a ten foot pole. My dad is a professional interior consultant for large scale resorts and casinos with experience more than my age. Anyway, that's probably only for the picky eyes.  I mean, the restaurant is clean, well lighted, good circulation and definitely meet the standard for an \""A\"" restaurant. \n\nThe Food: I will summarize it in 3 letters abbreviation: T.M.E {Too Much of Everything!!!!!}.  If it is to feed a farm worker who tills the field, rolls the hays, stacks pavements stones and whatever hard-manual-calorie-burning labors a farm worker does, then yes the portion is sufficient. But for a paper pusher, computer staring, sitting on your butt all day, going everywhere with cars folks for whom a distance between 1 parking space closer to the storefront is like a matter of life and death, the portion is a little bit much. I'm being sarcastic. Honestly, the portion is waaaaaaaay too much! Hello, people??? Is the coffee they served not thick enough to wake you up that you can see the mound of food in front of you?? Literally the food was stacked up and jabbed through with a big knife. Cool to see, cringe to think that the plate is for one person... ... I can only roll my eyes as people shovel at least half of the plates into their mouths.  Hey, I like to eat and indulge here and there. Regardless of my size. But this is off the chart.\n\nThe taste: Double word: \""so-so\""  (is it considered one word?) Nothing special here, folks, Move along! To quote the description of the stars rating \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" And I have. Plenty times different other places. Does it taste bad? To be fair, not really. Was it excellent? I really won't go that far! \n\nMy suggestion if you want to eat here:\nTreat this place like a family style dining, where you share the food. The more people you have in the party the better. \n\nFor example: The specialty flapjacks can serve 4-6 easy. The hash can serve 2 if you don't order anything else, and 4 if you order the pancakes or waffles. \n\nWe brought home the flapjack that morning, with the toasts, and we were full all the way until 7:30pm (that was a 10 hour filling breakfast!). Perhaps I should add 1 star for it's economical value? .. Nah :p"
0,"Could the service here be any worse? Seriously, the absolute worst. The one bartender looked at my empty glass and walked away. The other asked me if I wanted anything and didn't even look at my wife or her empty glass sitting 3 inches from mine. Haven't been here in months, and won't be back for months. Allegheny Wine Mixer is a billion times better and right up the street."
0,"I don't even know where to start with this place. I used to love the Scottsdale location, and when it opened up down in Chandler I was more than excited. The service went way downhill when Steve left. I continued to go as they really do have great food. On average, we would bring in 10-20 people. On a weekly basis most of the time. We'd have going away parties, birthday parties, you name it. \n\nWhen I knew it was getting bad- I went in to pick up lunch for my team at work. They told me I couldn't get a to go order (I'm sorry, what?) per the chef. The server ended up ringing in the order normally so I could get my food. I waited AN HOUR.  If it was even the slightest bit busy, I'd understand. Trust me, it wasn't.\n \nI gave them another chance.  After a friend ordered something that was nothing like she thought it would be the server said she couldn't take it off. We asked to talk to the owner, and the server said, \""are you sure? She's in a terrible mood\"". The owner refused to take it off the bill saying \""this isn't a tasting menu\"". That $8 roll was that important compared to our $200 tab.  She then proceeded to tell us to \""f*ck off\"".\n\nFor some asinine reason, a year later we return to give it another shot. The server was very nice. Towards the end of our stay, we saw the owner loudly talking to another customer, and pointing at us. We became very uncomfortable, so we left. As we were leaving, a host came running out. In a very sarcastic and obnoxious tone said, \""HAVE A GREAT NIGHT\""\n\nHow this place is still in business is amazing. This is NOT how you treat paying customers. I know the owner has multiple restaurants around the valley.  SHE alone is destroying such an awesome concept. Don't be in this business if you hate it."
1,"Consistent top notch service. In the three years I have worked near here, I have not had bad service even one single time. This is a great place to eat, and a breath of fresh air when compared to the service at most fast food joints."
0,"Was here last week with a pal, and it was rubbish.\n\nEach dish was served with some very nasty looking \""fresh\"" coriander leaves, and didn't provide much taste except hotness. \n\nMy naan was burnt, the rice was dry and tasteless, my friend's chipatti was just floury nonsense. \n\nDon't bother coming here."
0,"Yeah, I dont think we will be coming back any time soon here either. I dont know what has happened to this place over the last year, but something really bad has happened to it. \n\nThe water pitcher had someone's hair in it. The waiter made us feel like he was doing us a favor by serving us. The eggs benedict was cold, and so were the potatoes, so we waited 10 minutes for the waiter to come around to sent them back. They came back again cold. By this time the rest of the family had finished their meal so I said screw it, ate the potatoes cold, paid, and left. Gave them a sub-par tweet and they replied that they wanted to make things right with us. Still havent heard back from them. Im done."
1,"Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter. \nI love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit. The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.\nOnce you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register. All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!! The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!! Doesn't get any better than that!! \nParadise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit. \nPut Paradise Bakery on your \""always good\"" list!!"
1,Love the free shuttle service from/to the airport including drop off service to the strip.\n\nThe chocolate cookies are like crack. :)
1,"I have been going to this place for over 20 years now and it is the ideal greasy, cheesy and sinful cheeseburger and fries. The burgers are great and that goes with saying I don't eat meat anymore but I remember what they used to taste like. Fortunately, I can eat lots of other items that they have. The shakes are thick and fruity. I appreciate fries that are greasy but crisp, and in a brown paper bag and that's what you will get from Lucky Boy. \n\nLucky Boy not to be confused with the famous Big Boy burger shop (although you cannot miss the shop, there is a gigantic Big Boy-esque sign in red on top of the restaurant). It's not in the best area but neither are you going to see bullets come flying at you, come on some people have no clue what the ghetto really is."
1,"You're in vegas. Wants to dine-in yet there is no time to go to a buffet, but refuses to go to a fast food joint? Grand Lux is the answer. \n \nI think this is better than cheesecake factory. Despite the same ambiance, interior decoration, to-go bag color schemes, and menus, the food was a bit more tasteful than cheesecake factory.  \n \nI ordered the pork chops and I was very satisfied with my choice. When there is a mixture of apples with pork chops and mash potatoes and brussel sprouts- I'm in! The pork chops was perfect- not over cooked, not under cooked near the bone. I enjoyed every morsel that was left to the bone. My friends had a bite of my dish and agreed that they liked my dish.   \n\nThe service was tentative. They were concerned with our experience which is surprising for our group of 13. Other places tend to neglect you knowing that they have a guaranteed 18-20% tip. Here, they asked if the whole party was happy with their choices.\n \nPerfect meal and now to go hit the slots and clubs!"
0,"My team and I were trolling the strip looking for a place to eat. We decided that a burger would be simple and ideal. We found this French themed burger place inside of the Paris hotel and thought it should be good.\n When we walked up to the doors, we were greeted by a couple of hostesses that were way too ugly to have such a shitty, snooty attitude. They barely acknowledged us and just pointed inside to the bar and said \""seat yourselves\""\n We were too hungry to care so we sat down at the bar and the bartender just seemed tired, overworked and didnt really care about the people. To him, we were just another party crew passing through Las Vegas.\n He handed us all dirty, sticky greasy menus and disappeared for 10 minutes.\nWe finally gave him our drink orders and he was snappy with his response and seemed so annoyed by us, the people who tip. \n When I ordered my Guinness, he just poured it in the pint, one pour and let it sit and settle by itself. Any self respecting bartender would NEVER pour a pint of Guinness so poorly. If I were a manager or the establishments owner, I would give him his walking papers just for his lack of respect to Guinness and the art of the \""Perfect Pour.\"" I let that slide in hopes that the food would be great.\n  \nI ordered the Blue Cheese burger and when it finally came out, I sank my teeth into it and, while it was a tasty burger, it was without a doubt the greasiest thing I have eaten in very long time. \n It had disrupted my stomach that I could not even eat it anymore. It was heavier by the grease and not by the meat. Huge bun designed to fill you up and distract you from the fact that youre eating a greasy pile of beef in a huge doughy bun.\n  I perhaps wouldnt have been so disappointed by this if the $15 burger at least came with french fries, but I left with a stomach ache and never a desire to return.\n\nI would never recommend this place. If you want to eat a burger. Do NOT go here.\nThere is a Fatburger right down the strip and is worth the extra time/distance walking."
1,"I'm just gonna go out and say it-- I dont know if this is the best pizza in town, but I don't think anyone else can firmly beat it. Their whole just-shy-of-1000-degrees for a few minutes style of baking makes for a crisp pizza, and their options will please most people. Solid lunch spot. Try the Porta Alba Pizza-- buffalo mozzarella and lemon slices make for a happy diner."
0,"I stayed at the Luxor when it first opened and it was wonderful. i stayed there this week and it does not appear they have updated or kept up the maintenance on the rooms in years.\nFirst off the room was $170 a night for a room in the main pyramid room section. This was a weekday price that had been jacked up because a convention was in town. The room was maybe worth $70 a night.\nIn addition to the $170 they charged the $20 a night resort fee. Not sure what this was supposed to cover as the pool was closed and the wi if wasn't working. Oh, they don't have wi if. What year is this?\nThe furniture was all banged up, there where scratches along the walls and the blanket was thinner than the ones you are given on an airplane.\nThe beds are probably the original from when the hotel first opened; not comfortable at all. Ugh - those pillows. Also the most uncomfortable I have ever attempted to sleep on.\ni don't think housekeeping do anymore than the basics. The clock not plugged in, the\nsink plug was broken and stuck in the closed position.\nThe hairdryer only worked on the high setting and my hair got sucked into the fan in the back of it.\nThere was loud banging from 10 in the morning both days I was there. Hotels normally give their guests notice when there will be noise but the Luxor must not care at all about their guests.\nI could hear showers and toilets flushing from 3am to 10am one night so I didn't get any sleep.\nThere was a thick, black hair with root on the face washer which was just gross.\nThe rooms in the main building have seen better days and the maintenance seems to be zero\nBasic bathroom amenities; soap, shampoo/ conditioner combo moisturizer and body wash. No q tips, shower cap, sewing kits or anything else.\nNo bottles of water which could have at least made the resort fee less painful.\nThe place could be great with a total overall to bring the rooms into the 21st century. \nI will not be staying there again unless they make major changes to the place."
1,Best Mexican food in the East Valley! I hate to call it 'Mexican food' because that will probably make you think of the typical burritos and tacos you get at every other 'chain' restaurant - BORING. The owner/chef really puts an exotic twist on many of the dishes. My favorite is the Shrimp Mazatlan which is a beautiful mix of Jumbo shrimp and Pineapple skewered over a bed of rice. Ingredients are always fresh (the owner has his own garden behind the restaurant! \nBeen enjoying their menu since when they were in a little strip mall. Even back then their popularity caused crowds standing in the parking lot waiting to get a seat! Their new location is really classy so you can dress up of a nice dinner. But you'll still be in a crowd outside waiting for your seat. Believe me it's one of the few restaurants in the East Valley that's worth the wait.
0,"I just can't take it anymore... I was dragged into a BWW for the last time.  I hereby refuse to step into a BWW.  I don't care if all of my friends are there to hang out... I am not going.\n\nI typically avoid chain restuarants if at all possible, and this is no exception.  I will not be fooled into believing that this a good place to go.  I am NOT a common dullard that can be lulled in because of some clever commercials... you wings suck!\n\nThey do have huge TV's everywhere and the service is okay... but so what!\n\nReasons for not liking this place;\n\n1.  There wings suck!  Tiny little chicken wings.  They get tough with out being crispy.  Then they are drenched in some super sweet sauce of what ever... For $9 you get 12 tiny little wings served in a paper dish.\n\n2.  The chicken tenders are terrible.  They taste like something you would get at a skating rink or some terrible concession stand.  They were not \""tenders\"" as billed on the menu.  These were pieces of chicken all wadded up and super heavily breaded.  The blue cheese dressing had no blue cheese.  Ask me how I know there was no blue cheese...  \""Jason how do you know there was NO blue cheese in the dressing?\""  Well, becuase blue cheese is blue and it should be visible in a white sauce...\n\n3.  Afterpaying $19 for tenders and wings there were 3 small paper containers of food on the table.  I want something more substantial for $19.  A measly offering of low quality chicken products served in cheap paper boats is just bad...  Again - I will not be fooled!\n\n4.  I paid $5.75 for a regular size Blue Moon.  Maybe my exwife is right, maybe I am cheap!  But $5.75 for a regular size beer???  \n\nI am still pissed off - I hate this place.  If I went there to watch football on a Sunday it would cost me $80!!!  \n\nSmall wings drenched in super sweet tasteless sauce - nearly $6 for a glass of beer... uuuhhhh... I vow never to return."
0,"We went here yesterday for lunch, it wasnt packed at all and the lunch prices are good. They start you off with chips and salsa. Nothing special at all, I usually love chips and salsa but this salsa was straight up pace picante or somethng similar. Do not go to this place and expect authentic mexican food. We then ordered drinks, Javier had a margarita on the rocks, he loved it and was the perfect flavor and perfect amount of alcohol. We both then got the fajita lunch special, he got chicken with the flour tortillas and I got beef with corn tortillas. It came out in a small skillet but I think it was a perfect portion, I left not feeling too full. Javier on the other hand was too full. He ate the flour tortillas, which were very thick and looked like pancakes. I preffered the corn, not as filling and doesnt leave you stuffed. Im glad I tried this place, I will go back if Javier wanted to, but I wasnt impressed. I could make the same thing at home."
1,"This Starbucks has always been great. Before you even walk in, there is a nice and open patio where you can relax and drink your coffee. Inside, you are welcomed with warm colors and a friendly atmosphere. The cashier took a while to get my order right since there were other people in line as well, but they ended up getting it right eventually. This place would have gotten five stars if it wasn't for their prices. I bought one venti iced vanilla latte and also a grande coffee for my dad and it ended up being around 11 bucks! A bit pricey, but I will be back because of the convenient location and great coffee."
1,"This is a terrific little place that takes its beverages seriously, but not too. It's small and cozy, and felt like a good place to linger for a while. I could not on my visit, but I did find out that tea is just as important as coffee here. My green tea took a few minutes, but it was worth the wait. This isn't a cafe to dash in and out of if you're in a hurry, but it's quality."
0,I've been here a few times but never really happy with service or food. It's just plain and boring food. Just the usual pub grub nothing really cries out. Picked different things off menu every time I've been and nothing really satisfies me. Last time service was really loud. Just puts me off. Maybe I'm just spoilt for choice but I'd choose others above this.
1,"I was at the Cosmo last week, and wanted to eat somewhere simple but delicious.\nHolsteins hit the spot!! My server, Mike was super friendly and knowledgeable! Customer service alone is a reason to go back, and I will soon because I'm already drooling for another scrumptious Rising burger as I type this !!!"
0,"They have changed their wing recipe, they now bread all of their wings. This is very disappointing, a real buffalo wing is never breaded. If I wanted breaded wings I would suffer through the horrible wings at Hooters. Corporate get your act together and go back to how they have been made for the last 25 years!"
0,"I drink coffee daily and have lived in the Pacific Northwest for the past ten years for background purposes. \n\nIn regards to the Not So Mighty Cup. The coffee is good, but overpriced. The service is below average.\n\nWith that being said, if I lived around the corner I would probably come here. Thank the Creator I don't live in downtown Glendale."
0,The dinner buffet on Monday was mediocre at best and we got there at 730pm.  It was way over priced with the minimum options for food.  They advertise sushi and the products they used mostly came out of cans like tuna or crab.  The bbq was dry and overcooked.   The Chinese food was good but far from authentic...like the Mongolian Beef was tasty but white onions not green onions.  The white steamed rice was crispy like when it's left in a hot pan without water.  The Italian food was okay but the pizza was cheap on dough and cheese.\n\nThe best part was the omelet bar.  Fresh ingredients made to order.\n\nI love buffets and always go back for seconds...this was the first ever time I didn't go back.\n\nPS - the service was awesome though.  Our drinks were always full.
0,Just ate my first burger with jalopenos.  Burger was cold; it was mostly bread and not worth the 7 bucks.  Won't be going back. To each his own.

0,"Okay, so... this Vons is ghetto.\n\nI never like going here because the parking lot is full of cigarette beggars, money beggars, shopping carts are never brought back in or all over the shopping plaza, not a big selection of healthy foods... The cashiers are not professional and speak in slang, or they talk to other cashiers and completely ignore customers..."
0,It's a two star because the server tried real hard. Read the review by Bryan M. We went there together. A few things he didn't mention was how lazy the bartender is and the left over food left in the cracks of the table. Ewww... I would Skip this location.
0,Couldn't find a clean table out of 7 open tables. Pizza wasn't bad but we won't be returning. Soda fountain was very sticky from old spilled  soda.
1,"I will always love Drai's.  \n\nI've been going here since 2001, and each and every time it never lets me down.  We headed over here for after hours after Body English.  There wasn't really much of a crowd, considering we went here fairly early for afterhours, but the music is awesome.  I love every single thing they play and this place has a ultra sexy vibe to it.  I will never say \""no\"" to going here. \n\nAgain.....I love Drai's."
0,"So, I thought I could pick up some things for school since the campus bookstore was closed. \""Just a few notebooks, they're cheap,\"" I says to myself. \n\nBut uh, here at CVS, I actually laughed aloud at what they were selling this stuff for. Paper was five dollars and UP. \n\nFirst you kill Sahara, now you want TEN DOLLARS for a spiral-bound notebook?!\n\nDie."
1,"I really enjoy Earl of Sandwich.\n\nFirst and foremost, I love that their soups are only $2.99.\nI am a huge fan of tomato soups and they have a very good tomato soup with croutons.\nEoS is generally a rather affordable food compared to nearly everything else on the strip.\n\nStrangely enough, Kalila and I both wanted soup today. We went to Earl of Sandwich for some Broccoli Cheddar. It was a VERY HEAVY soup. It was good and tasty. I would have liked some more broccoli chunks though.\n\nI had a full montague and it was delicious. I really liked the roast beef and the mustard.\n\nKalila had the canonballs and it was also delicious. The sauce seemed to be all over the sandwich wrapper instead of the meatballs, though. Overall, it was kind of dry. \n\nWe like that the bread is toasted, but after reading Misti's review, she makes a great point about how there are no other bread choices.\n\nBased off of the other times Kalila has eaten there:\nShe highly recommends getting a tuna melt sandwich and a tomato soup. Eating them together is reaaaaaallly good!\n\nOH, AND!\nYou can order a Grey Lemonade. It's Grey Iced tea and lemonade. Basically, an arnold palmer with a different type of iced tea. Whether or not you like it, depends on your taste buds. I know people who love it and people who can just tolerate it. It is something that they fill your cup behind a wall, but refills are free if you ask at the pick up area. Just try it to see if you like it or not.\n\n#foodcrew"
0,"Meh. I've experienced better. I can't complain too much the room was cheap ($56) on Priceline, but ranking this hotel 3 stars is a stretch. They claim to be 4 stars on their website, which is definitely a falsity.\nThe rooms have sort of been remodeled. By this I mean the floors and bedding have been updated, but the furniture and phone have not. The room could have been cleaner, yes. The phone (which was ancient) was not clean. The bathroom was completely tiled and our tub took a really long time to drain.\nThe front desk was always friendly and helpful. Called us a cab, offered us coffee.\nThe gym (this term is used loosely) consisted of a broken treadmill, an elliptical and some free weights. The water cooler didn't work either.\nThe walls are thin, very thin. Miley Cyrus was at the Bell Centre the weekend we were there and we were unfortunately made aware of that fact. Someone was sobbing (sobbing.) in the room next to ours. (hope everything is ok) but didnt need to hear all that.\nWalking distance to Crescent bars which was nice. \nFor a place to crash, Hotel Espresso works, but thats about the end of it."
1,"Let me start by saying that I am a big time movie fanatic. When I get down time from work and school, your most likely gonna find me at the movies. I will drive the distance or pay the price to watch at a good place, this one just so happens to be really close to my house. I've always liked the environment at the cannery but yesterday, 8/26/13, it got even better when they added the luxury seats like the ones they have in green valley. These seats are beasts, you sink into them, you can recline to the point where you're lying down and watching the movie, with room to spare. North town we movin up in the world lol"
1,"Good restaurants, good shops and a great movie theater. I like coming here to catch the acoustic bands near the Barnes & Noble. The parking and traffic can be a nightmare on the weekends, so just be careful."
0,"I tried the Brunch at Bacchanal Buffet for $40 per person.  After all, it was not worthy my $40 and was quite disappointed.  There was no line when getting into the buffet.  I was expecting a long wait because the previous reviews online.  \n\nI understand that Brunch was the combination of breakfast and lunch.  Of course I found a lot of breakfast related foods.  Such as potato, eggs and bacon.  I just remember seeing a lot of potato plates.  I supposed to be a fan of potato but it was just way too much.  \n\nThe only thing I could remember that was good was the Chinese chicken ginseng soup that comes in a little pot container.  The soup was pretty good that I have to compliment and in a little cute pot.  \n\nFor the Japanese section, I was hoping to see some nice sushi selections.  Too bad, they only had some rolls that were not looking good.  They have small slices of sashimi combination in a little bowl but wasn't great at all. \n\nAfter all the disappointment, we waited until 3pm to see if they have more stuff for the dinner time.  I tried their little pearl oysters which I think were pretty fresh so we ate about 20 pieces.  We tried the lobster soup but wasn't that good. \n\nSo overall the experience wasn't that great for me and for $40 it wasn't worthy at all.  I could have pay less for the Bellagio buffet that has much more items.  And remember, the dinner price was about $48."
1,"Love this gym! Instructors are awesome\nand will push you to your limit. Spinning classes are great! My heart rate is up to the roof with my sweat burning my eyes and running down my chin. I keep telling myself to try other classes but to be honest, I'm kinda intimidated by them. I should really suck it up and just go to them. I mean, there are old ladies joining those classes and are still alive! Pools are  big enough for everyone. You'll also find steam rooms and sauna. Nothing to brag about with the cafe food. It tastes really \""healthy.\"" Would give it a 5 star if the monthly charges weren't so high."
0,"Not impressed- $17 for a \""worlds best lobster roll\"" & it was seriously the size of a child's sandwich.  Also, it was overcooked.  Really??  They could do better I don't care how expensive lobster is!!  Go somewhere else and save your money."
1,Brand new .Very nice and clean .
0,"Wow, this is my 3rd time trying to post a review, and each time it has been erased when I go to press submit....\n\nI came here based on the awesome yelp reviews and was VERY disappointed. The food was awful. I am not vegetarian nor vegan so I am not knowledgeable in appreciating good mock meat, but I CAN differentiate between tasty and unappetizing.\n\nArtichoke Dip was watery and looked like light grey/brown colored gunk.\n\nI got the Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl with tofu and was only able to take a couple bites because it really tasted awful. I typically really like eating tofu too. Please believe me in that I am not a picky eater and it is very rare for me to dislike a restaurant meal.\n\nMy boyfriend got a mock beef dish that had this underlying soy flavor. One plus about both our entrees was the amount of veggies in our dishes, but we couldn't even pick out the vegetables because of that strong background taste that lingered on our tongues."
1,"Outstanding Value:\n   I applaud Station Casinos for charging reasonable prices for delicious food. Palace Station is the exception.\n  On a Saturday night, I waited on line for a couple of minutes, paid a little over $10 for the dinner buffet, and was eating delicious food.\n  In my opinion the high points were the Asian foods station, shrimp scampi with pasta, and soup. The one disappointment is that there was not won ton soup.\n  The music, the whole era of rock and roll was enjoyable listening to. The buffet was not packed, so I did not feel rushed.\n  I have dined here numerous times on a Saturday night, and have left satisfied and full."
1,"Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full. Good to see. Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why."
1,This Gordon Biersch is great. Great food and service! The manager Eddy is why this is my favorite location. He is always on point and you can tell runs the place well
0,"First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. \n\nWe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. \nOur daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. \n\nThunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back."
0,"Never again, just avoid it, I felt like I was ripped off.  Of course I only have myself to blame for that."
1,The only reason why I did not rate as 5 stars was the very slow end service. It took 20 minutes for the waiter to pick up the payment and cash us out. Otherwise the food was great! I will be returning.
0,"Drove twenty minutes out of my way to get some vegan food at this whole foods. I went away empty handed because some manager in prepared foods came up and asked for certification for my service dog. You should teach your employees that you are not allowed to ask for certification under the American disabilities act. You are allowed to ask if the dog is a service dog and what service that dog provides. I informed the manager of this and he said that \""just so you know we have a sign that says only service dogs are allowed so if he's not a service dog you need to go\"" As someone with PTSD and severe anxiety I was mortified and left empty handed. The man was watching me in the store and standing at the door while I left. It made me feel really creeped out and uneasy. I will probably never return to this location. I Thanks for the public humiliation tonight.\n\nI called back to complain and the manager sounded very unapologetic. I'm now sitting at home on the verge of an anxiety attack. Probably will have to call into work tomorrow. Thanks guys."
0,"I purchased the Groupon for Flavor Flav's about a month ago and finally got a chance to come by and try them out. I had heard from previous reviewers that the wait for chicken was quite long, so I thought I'd be extra smart and place my order over the phone in advance. We put our order in about 40 minutes before arriving at the restaurant. My fella called in and had the store on speaker while he ordered so I heard both sides of the conversation. He ordered the chicken and told them we would be by in about 30-40 minutes to pick up our order and that we had a Groupon to redeem. The girl on the phone kept saying \""ok, ok\"" and even took down my fella's name, never once indicating they might have a problem having our order ready when we get there. \n\n40 minutes later, we arrive at Flavor Flav's and tell the guy at the counter that we put in a phone order and that we had a Groupon. The guy then referred us to the girl behind the counter who I assume is the one who took our phone order. She explained that they have had problems with people ordering over the phone in the past with a Groupon and showing up and not actually having a Groupon to redeem that they refuse to start cooking orders for customers with Groupons until customers show up. I can understand this as a problem, but I don't really understand why she couldn't have explained any of this to us over the phone when we put our order in. There were several other customers who had this precise problem that walked in after us and they were quite peeved as well. We put in our order at the counter and 45 frustrating minutes later we received our chicken and waffles (minus the red velvet, since they were out of batter). By this time, my fella was quite thirsty and asked for something to drink. They offered us a free two liter for our trouble and to be fair the staff was quite friendly to all that were waiting for their chicken, giving us updates as to how much longer we would have to wait and offering us beverages while we stood around. They could avoid all hostility with customers if they just explained their stance on phone orders in advance instead of having people come all the way in only to find out they have to order again in person and wait.\n\nThe food was really good, probably 4 stars if I was rating the food alone. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the waffles were probably my favorite thing we had. I only wish they had given us more than one small container of syrup for the three large waffles."
0,"We too were excited to come here but were sadly disappointed.  First please be advised it is not handicap accessible.  There are no elevators which lead from the parking garage up to the restaurant and the stairs are very dangerous and extremely hot due to the fact they are metal.  In the restaurant, The chairs are made of wood and are very hard and very uncomfortable.  The menu was hard to figure out for seniors and was not very easy to read or understand for seniors.  Do not believe the wait staff ever, they told us things which was not true for some of there items.  The apricot sauce which comes with the Sweet Potato fries is hot and spicy unlike the wait staff which said opposite, it burned my mouth.  Also the thing they call Vegetable Pasta on the side menu is not pasta, they are lying, it is cold stringy vegetables shaped like angel hair pasta but it is not pasta.... Their mayo if you order it with a sandwich has SOY in it which there wait staff did not even know mayo had soy in it.  The bowls of food are very small, the drinks are very expensive and lots of there items they sell you they get from their own little market rather than cooking it fresh.  The sweet potatoe fries were good but very salty and their grass fed burger was real good but we were disappointed in their flavor which was very lacking and in their whole concept of what they think good food is plus the wait staff not knowing about certain items was a bummer plus they are not too particular about looking nice and presentable as they looked like homeless people - I have never in my entire life ever been waited on my someone wearing a base ball cap so unprofessional.  MY advice make sure you ask about all he ingredients even the condiments as they were wrong about a few of their products especially the ones they grabbed from their market.  \n\nThe music is a bit too loud and their apple crumble dessert was very good but more for breakfast then a dessert"
0,Went there for lunch today 3/2/13.  Business hours posted said they closed at 4PM on Saturday's.  Then why the hell were they close at 350PM ?  I will never visit this establisment again.
1,"I have no idea what I was thinking ordering oatmeal AND splitting \""The Kitchen Sink\"" with Don. That was just way too much food to handle. For those of you that don't know. \""The Kitchen Sink\"" pretty much has everything in it. I can't even tell you what the ingredients are because the description just says. \""For adventurers only, this one really has it all.\"" It's also the only omelet on the menu that comes in a size large and you can't get it in any other size. \n\nMy oatmeal came out right away. It was in a regular size bowl with raisins, brown sugar, butter, and cream on the side. I mixed everything in and started chowing down. To be honest, this was the first time I've ever ordered oatmeal anywhere. I normally just eat oatmeal at home and feel like it's overpriced at restaurants, but I was craving it and it was only $2.99 (a great value for the amount you get). The texture was nice. It wasn't too thick, too watery, or too grainy, just right. I ate about half of it when the omelet came out. It was seriously huge and literally had EVERYTHING in it. It doesn't say it on the menu, but Mamie P. stated down below that it's made with SIX eggs. No wonder it's giant. I saw carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, chili, hotdogs, cheese, bacon, ham, turkey, onions, broccoli...I'm guessing everything that's listed as ingredients for all the other omelets is in this omelet. It also come with spuds on the side and you choice of carbs, e.g. tortillas, toast, English muffin, pumpkin bread, or banana nut bread. We went with the banana nut, which was delicious and fresh. The spuds look like potato chips, but they're thicker and soft. Don is a potato freak, so he enjoyed them. The omelet was just a little too much for me, especially after eating half of my oatmeal. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty with the mixture of all the meats and veggies, but I was just too full to enjoy it. If we ONLY ordered the omelet, I think I would've really liked it. Don enjoyed the amount of mushrooms it had in it and the Filipino in him really loved the hotdogs as well. I really suggest you only get \""The Kitchen Sink\"" if you're splitting it between at least two people and that's all you're ordering. You should also be fine with the amount of random ingredients that are in it. It's kind of like an \""ghetto\"" omelet in which everything is just thrown into. \n\nAll in all, I like this place. The menu is very broad, they have about 40 or so omelets, and the service is fast and friendly. I noticed there were a lot of regulars when I went, so it almost felt like having breakfast at someone's house (not in an awkward way). When we were walking out I even noticed a cookie jar that was just like the cookie jar my mom had in our kitchen when I was little (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s4JjYgLO5dGUUV9Op4YBrw/l.jpg). It was literally the same exact one. I didn't say anything, but ten seconds later, Don said, \""Dude, that's the same cookie jar my mom had when I was little.\"" So we learned that we had something in common as kids. Next time, I'll stick to a smaller omelet though, or maybe stuffed French toast and definitely another piece of their banana nut bread ;)"
0,I'm currently living here at the moment and I have to say that the management is very bad. Although they offer all of these amenities for tenants the business center created to assist us in being able to use the internet and have a printer the computers are never working and when you ask what's wrong with them they say oh the storm messed them up but their computers in their offices are just fine. The printer prints very light so you can barely see what you've printed. The maintenance people are weird and obviously stalk clients because I got a dog on a Monday and that Wednesday the office called and said you need to come pay for having a pet when my dog never barked once so I know they didn't find out through a complaint. The apartments are nice at a glance but I can tell there's a lot of stuff covered up with nice paint and ikea like designing materials. Lastly the office is always closed!
0,"Was invited to the @MonsterlandAZ grand re-opening. My roommate was the head chef, and had a table reserved for our party (30 people) for 7 PM.\n\nThe problem centered around the GM arbitrarily deciding that our party was not on the list, despite being shown by multiple people that we were, and arbitrarily deciding that we could be shuffled down the priority chain.\n\nWe agreed to wait for other tables to clear, and chose to move next door for drinks, while we waited for our table.\n\nBy 10 PM we decided to eat at the restaurant next door.\n\nMyself and my friend left, but we learned that none of our party actually made it in to the venue, other than drinks.\n\nThis was a gross display of poor customer service, and ridiculous favoritism on the part of the GM.\n\nI have not ever been, and will not ever go."
1,"Haven't been there since last June, but it was well worth the $20 charge per person for lunch.\n\nServing King Crab and Roast Beef (usually reserved for a dinner buffet) isn't what makes it special.  They have (or had then) one of the top 10 Chocolatiers in the world.  \n\nUsually at a buffet the dessert island looks like it was set up through a production line process.  Not this place.  EVERYTHING looked awesome, and (what I tried) tasted even better than it looked.\n\nMy wife had a chocolate shooter and exclaimed \""this is so good that they should require a prescription for it.\""\n\nWe had to limit ourselves because something that damn tasty cannot be good for you.  I am not normally a dessert person but it was phenomenal.  \n\nDue to the fact that too much sugar is not healthy. I usually (if ever) do not eat dessert, and if I do it wouldn't be more than 1 dessert servings at any one meal. It was so good I had 2 & 1/2 servings (I had to taste to see if it was as delicious as it looked [and it was]).\n\nIt has been nearly a year since I was there, but I am looking forward to my next visit at the end of May so that I can once again enjoy my self imposed dessert limit (2 next time).\n\nIt's a good thing that I don't live in Vegas or I'd be needing to go on a diet in no time."
1,"I came here visiting from Colorado. It was a wonderful experience. Polite staff, quick service, great breakfast food. Menu was extensive, and large portions for the price. Everything I would want for a breakfast place, smaller but plenty of room. Well worth the wait. I would definitely return here. Wish the owner was still in Colorado now!"
0,Server was nice and attentive. Thus the two stars. Food had zero redeeming qualities. Mushy and flavorless.
0,I used to donate plasma here and it's not too bad of an experience as long as you get there early but one time I went in and had a puncture wound from a cat on my arm which does happen as I'm a vet tech. They swore up and down I was doing drugs and that I could no longer donate. I told them I had an accident report at work and I could pass a drug test but it didn't matter they swore I was lying. Now a few years later my family is tight on money so I call to see if I could donate and they say I'm on a permanent deferral list but can not tell me why over the phone. I can come in and talk to a medical person if I would like. I asked if it was to explain why or if the deferral could be reversed. Of course it's permanent and I can waste my time just to hear they think I am on drugs. I have seen so many people there that are on drugs still donating even doing drugs in the parking lot but I offer proof and they still say no.
1,"We tried Pedro's using our Groupon we had purchased. I can say that this place has been around for 50 years per our cashier and it is well established. The service was prompt and the ice tea, chips and salsa were very good. The salsa wasn't overpowering and the chips were crispy and light. Our meals arrived shortly after we had finished eating the chips and salsa. My husband ordered the #1 and I ordered the #3. The shredded beef tacos, cheese enchiladas and tamale were delightful. Every bite was savory and tender. \nI would recommend this restaurant for Mexican food. The staff is friendly and efficient, attentive and helpful. We will be back."
1,"Wow, The food here is amazing!!!! I had already heard great things about this place before we went. The Lobster Milanaise lived up to all the hype - HUGE portion and very delicious. I ordered the Maine Lobster and it was a total home run! Spectacular! They served the drawn butter cream sauce on the side instead of regular melted butter. Loved it. \n\nThe only thing that wasn't spectacular was the oysters on the half shell we got for an appetizer. They did not taste that fresh. \n\nOf course, our waitress was a seasoned professional and totally on the ball. The rest of the wait staff was amazing as well - Jay made sure my glass was never even close to empty!\n\nThe atmosphere was nice. It felt like you were in a jungle. Hard to believe we were in the middle of a casino!"
1,"This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.)\nONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening. \n\nOh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events."
0,"WORST PLACE EVER!!!  Make sure you pay before you go in otherwise they will change the quote and charge you more.  It was a good place, now that managment has changed, they are the biggest jerks ever.  And I only got an oil change. NEVER GO HERE!!!"
1,"Simple, homey and well done comfort food. Terrific goulash!"
0,"I hate bland food. My friends and i all ordered different dishes. Roast chicken-bland, beef cheeks-bland, and salmon-bland.  If you come here stick to the starters, those dishes had more flavor especially the bone marrow and beef tartar. This restaurant does have excellent cocktails and friendly service. My suggestions is stick to drinks and starters. Oh the other thing I though was strange was they only hand 1 stall for the restroom."
0,Kitchen staff was not wearing gloves. They were rotating between cleaning and preparing food without washing their hands. They also had a fowl mouth and was swearing so loud you can. Hear them at the counter. I tried to speak with the manager but he dismissed my concerns. The only helpful and amazing individual that was helpful was the young lady who ran the  cash register.
1,"Yup, this is how a nouveau-sushi bar is supposed to be.  Fantastically-fresh fish, creative menu twists to go with old stand-bys and top, top service from the men with the magic rice."
0,"Service, food quality, and EVERYTHING overall is below standards. \n\nThe only thing is that the restaurant was crowded giving me an impression that it was actually decent.\n\nIt took half an hour alone to get a server's attention to place an order. Usually at other pho restaurants you LEAVE in half an hour. With this half hour there was a family of four near me. The two daughters finished eating and their parents never got their food. A waiter Carried food out and delivered to every corner of the restaurant..how does that even work. \n\nWhen our future finally came,  it only took us one sip of the soup to know that they used a dirty pot to prepare our soup. A pot, that was just used to prepare a rice dish that I saw come out a few minutes before my food. \n\nJust go eat McDonald's."
1,"I heard about this place a while back when they were in one of the Las Vegas Weekly articles. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time but it is very hidden. But this isn't about the location, this is about the food. \n\nI am of Thai and Laotian decent and i would have to say this place is amazing food wise. My mother owns  and runs a Thai restaurant and i would have to say that how this place fuses flavors and showcases foods from various Asian countries is amazing. \n\nI have been to all the Thai restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley, even the bad ones and this is my favorite spot to eat. It is all about the Food here, I am certain if they had money to invest and a better location, this place would always be packed. \n\nThe food is great, vegetables not over cooked. This food is Real Thai Food. Archi's and Pin Kaow are good too but there food is geared towards americans. Try this place out, you won't regret it."
0,"Tad bit disappointed this morning with the breakfast. Chicken, egg & cheese bagels were bland and seemed to have shrunken in size. Both were ordered regular but one came without the cheese. To our luck as the Mrs. Didn't actually want cheese. The restaurant must not have been wiped down the night before as it was plain to see that the booth walls and backs of chairs were covered in greasy fingers and hand marks. However the highlight was that service was adequate and associates were polite as always."
1,"There's a Habitat ReStore store. And then there's Julia's Coffee. And they are attached! That's super.\n\nReally, my adventure to Julia's started out in Cotswold as I was searching for a close place with good coffee and free WiFi. Thanks to my handing Yelp app, Julia's came up first just a few miles away with free WiFi! Hooray!\n\nInside, Julia's is adorable - it's super clean and full of affordable used books (sales benefit Habitat for Humanity), cute little tables and board games. And, clearly they have beverages and a few snack-aroos for sale. I camped out at Julia's for a few hours and tried two different beverages. The first was their decaf iced mint green tea. The friendly barista behind the counter suggested it as a nice refreshing drink for the blazing hot afternoon. It was tasty and indeed refreshing. A small came out to $2.02 including tax. \n\nAs for my second beverage, I have to agree with Deanna H. that their Chai Latte is incredible! It is insanely flavorful, spicy and offered the perfect amount of foam. My Chai Latte was in the $3 range - much cheaper (and more delicious) than Starbucks, if I may say so. \n\nThis is a great spot to grab a tasty beverage, hang out or purchase gently used books - all supporting great, local cause."
0,"The prices were higher than I'm use to. The finished product was ok, not as great as the girl doing them bragged that they would be. I asked about packages for a wedding party and was impressed with the offer they have. \n\nBUT, as I was finishing up and got our my credit card I was asked by the girl (who kept taking calls while doing my nails) if I had cash for the tip. I was thrown off and asked if I couldn't put the tip on my card. She said yes but then she would have to wait for the money. \n\nFirst, the owner should pay out tips the same day that they are charged. Second, OMG beyond unprofessional and rude!!!!!! I have never in my life run into a situation like this. I had to run out to get cash and contimplated not returning, but I'm not like that. She recieved a smaller tip than she would have it I had put in on my card. \n\nNo I won't return and I'm taking the wedding party elsewhere"
0,"Well we drove across town to try this place because of the good reviews. First of all I LOVE hole in the wall Mexican places and I have been to a lot. I am from Denver and pretty much grew up on Colorado Mexican. We spent six years in Southern Cali, and about two years in Arizona. The food is just very,different then Colorado and with that said I want to rate this place on the low end of the scale. If the chips and salsa would have been decent I probably would have left a bit happier. The chips were cold, thick and flavorless, the salsa was a very thin not so great as well. There were 5 adults in our party, everyone got something different. I was not impressed by any of it. I ordered a chimichanga at the recommendation of the server and it was not good at all.  I got it \""enchalada\"" style for two more dollars and it had about a spoonful under it, not enchalada style at all and for $12.00 I was like seriously wishing we were anywhere else then there. The waitress was very friendly and brought me a side of sauce but the best thing about this place is you get a giant Coke with refills. My husband and daughter had a margarita and they were decent but for just under a hundred bucks I was pissed all the way home lol!,\nIf your ever in Colorado hit the Santiago's, and see how we make our Mexican :)"
0,Very very slow drive through. Waited way too long at the speaker.  Maybe about 15 minutes then decided it didn't work so I proceeded to exit the drive through.  Once you enter this drive through there is no way out.  I was blocked by a truck at the window for another 5 or 10 minutes.  So basically I spent at least 20 minutes in this drive through and did not get any food.  Which is OK with me but I was getting the food for my Mom who had a procedure done at Carle and was starved!!
0,"I've been here twice and whilst the music is decent enough for cutting shapes on the dancefloor, it's a small, hazardous dancefloor! My friend has a scar on her shin from a painful step/killer heel incident. You don't really expect to have to contend with random stairs when you're just trying to have fun dancing your night away. This place also seems to have a really high male to female ratio, maybe all the girls saw the steps, predicted death by heels and went somewhere more accommodating. \n\nIt just doesn't have any redeeming features that would lure me back. It's not cheap, lavish or spacious, it probably relies on it's location and lack of decent clubs on George Street to get people in."
0,"My husband brought me to this restaurant during out trip to Vegas.  He found it through yelp and searching for gluten free.  I was so disappointed!   I just don't understand people who liked this place.  The service was terrible.  The restaurant wasn't busy, yet, it took forever to get a seat.  We didn't get drinks either in a timely manner.\n\nThen came to the food.  We ordered bruschetta.  It was delicious, however, it sat on the bar waiting on the waitress forever.  We were starving waiting for it.  \n\nMy husband and I both ordered the pizza.  What a mess!  Tasteless, and bland don't even start to say how poor they were.  The crust was blah, as was the sauce and toppings.  \n\nBy this time, we were grumpy.  Our drinks didn't get refilled either.  We paid our bill...eventually and left.\n\nDid I mention how expensive this was for what we got???   \n\nDon't go there!!!!"
1,"We went on a Saturday afternoon, the decor was inviting. The staff wasn't  as friendly as some places we have been. However, they were not rude or anything. Just not overly friendly.The Rolls are good sized portions and the sauces are really yummy. Food overall was great!!!!!!"
1,"For the past several years, I have always had conflicting plans on the date of Charlotte Oktoberfest. Finally, I was able to make it this year.  Thankfully, the owners of grapevine in Fort Mill run buses up there which is super convenient and well worth the $20 round trip ticket.  \n\nCharlotte Oktoberfest is not a true Oktoberfest in the German sense.  Most of the beer is American craft and microbrews, there is little German food to be found, and the music is not German.  It is a beer festival much more than an Oktoberfest, but it is a large and good beer festival.\n\nThe weather was iffy at times but not terrible.  They used to use some of the indoor buildings but I was told that led to too much broken glass.  Still, other beer festivals have used the sturdy plastic sample vessels with few complaints so that's an option.  \n\nMost importantly, there was a lot of good beer to be sampled, including a plethora of home brewers.  If you're a beer snob it's a great event, but do not expect a traditional German Oktoberfest."
1,"I'm delayed in my review, I went to Fizz the end of November after the Rod Stewart concert. \nI knew it was new and couldn't wait to check it out. I arranged to meet friends there and we had a blast! \nWe were greeted  & given a table right away (there was only 1 open). I was surprised they were so accommodating since we weren't doing bottle service or anything. \nThe server was very nice and helpful. I ordered the Le Fizz and later switched to the Fizz Fraise. Prices are typical strip lounge rates. So don't complain, you should know it's not going to be cheap walking in! \nThe space is small and intimate. Very sexy! Easy to have conversation and mingle. The DJ was great also, kept the vibe upbeat with out being too loud. \nIt's fun to walk around and look at the decor and rare art pieces that are from Elton's private collection. This is definitely going to be the place to hang after any show at the Collosseum. There were several members of the band hanging out with friends and family. \nCan't wait to have a schmancy reason to go back!"
1,"Well, just left full and happy on an AZ Burger (beef burger with green chiles) and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were good-sized and flavorful on a good-quality bun. Delicious, cold seedless globe grapes as a garnish.\n\nWe also each had a pastry, and thought they were quite good.\n\nA great spot for brunch or lunch."
1,"When you have people come up to you during your wedding saying things like \""The food at your wedding is so good... it's better than my wedding\"" you know you have an amazing caterer. \n\nLena's Flowers and Catering did an absolutely fantastic job at our wedding! Working with the vendor was an absolute breeze. We were able to do a great tasting which helped us narrow down our selection ( sooooo many options!) and were extremely impressed with the chef and the professionalism. We opted to do a buffet to give everyone a taste of everything and we are so glad we did! People raved about the Prime Rib and Pork Tenderloin and they couldn't get enough of the sun dried tomato/garlic mashed potatoes! Everything was really delicious and prepared perfectly. \nFlowers were also fantastic! I utilized this vendor for my bouquet, my MoH's bouquet, and boutonnieres and corsages. I was so appreciative of the time they took during the consultation and also the fact that they didn't try to shove traditional bouquets down my throat. They really listened to my ideas and offered some amazing flower suggestions. When the bouquets arrived, I couldn't believe how pretty and unique they were! \nTotally a pleasure working with this vendor and would do it again in a heartbeat!"
1,I love this place. The best selection in the valley with the most knowledgeable staff.
0,"Went to ask a question about my new IPhone.  There was a customer ahead of me so i was asked to wait.  No problem...\nThen while waiting on me, another customer comes in the door. He however is asked what is the problem and the clerk starts to help him while I'm sitting there.  Clerk now says he can wait on two people at once.  Now I have half his attention at best, because he is reaching to make a phone call for the other guy.\nNo respect!  Maybe it's a senior citizen thing.  I no longer recommend this place.  I walked out of the store, I haven't done that in a LONG time."
0,I would give no star if I could. I was with my pregnant wife and my 3 year old son and they called our name after waiting 30 minutes. They called our names and we went up but the hostess  rudely told us some one else with the same name already took our spot and we were not up yet. I asked for her to check and again was rudely spoken to being told I need to stop talking. She eventually checked where my spot was in the list and she realized she did in deed give our spot to the wrong person. Staff was disrespectful and could care less about their customers. Needless to say we will not be putting any more of our money at this restaurant.
1,Great food.. Good wine.. The meatballs are amazing... Along with the bruschetta.
0,"They get the single star not for the doughnuts but because it was 112 degrees outside and they had no AC going in the restaurant. It may have been hotter in the restaurant than outside it. \n\nIt was hard to order since I couldn't concentrate on anything but the heat. I bought three doughnuts but couldn't ditsy to enjoy them because of the warmth. I bought the chocolate Bismarck, a raspberry jelly, and some sort of crunch doughnut. They were all good. Too bad I had to enjoy them in the car of the Starbucks parking lot. I will try them again hopefully in January when I won't care if it's so hit inside the restaurant."
0,"I just went there and try to get a table. First the wait is 30-45 min. You look around and there are many many empty tables!\nSecond, the hostesses are rude!!! Too much of an attitude toward the clientele!\nPeople is complaining about food being cold! And we witness 2 tables ask for their checks!\nBottom line this place needs better management! Am not coming back until I see better reviews! Las Pampas you guys suck!!!"

Their restroom is quite small of me since they don't have a large counter and there was no door for the toilet \""room\"" but there is a main sliding door. Unless you don't mind taking a leak/shit while another person is using the rest of the bathroom then it's fine.  Their kitchen and the over all design of the room is amazing.  I would love to stay here again when I am in town"
0,"Food was awful, very bland and poorly prepared. Ambience and service was ok. But this place is 1star at best."
0,"filet mignon - asked for well done, got rare instead. butternut squash ravioli was insanely buttery and creamy. no other taste was comprehensible. service was ok and the filet mignon was kept off the bill. I guess they can have better days with the service but the food itself is not up to the mark."
1,"Love the handmade tortillas!  So scrumptious.\n\nThe queso is awesome, but severely overpriced ($4?  Come on).\n\nUsually always get the shrimp fajitas to share; only tried a menu item once, and it was good.\n\nLove it here; just not a fan of walking out smelling like grilled onions."
0,"Positives:\nSmoke free section of the casino\nBeds are really comfortable\nMonorail station at hotel\n\nOk now for the review. So we are in town for a convention and wanted to stay a few days extra to enjoy Vegas. Decided to book a few nights at LVH because there was a deal I couldn't pass up on a travel site. So we check in and I ask about an upgrade to a room with a refrigerator and was told that there was the newly updated rooms for $20 extra a night with all these extra features like in room coffee and the requested refrigerator. Then in looking at the site there is not much difference in the $10 extra and $20 extra a night. In room coffee maker, yeah my morning caffeine. Until I pick up the cup and read the lid.... $3.50 per cup used. I can get a venti coffee at Starbucks cheaper. Even the room service coffee was a better deal at 2 cups for $5.75. $18 a day resort fee and I have to pay $3.50 a cup of coffee and can only connect one device to the wifi connection. While I am not a big fan of resort fees, usually don't complain too much when I have coffee, wifi, newspaper, gym etc.However,  the resort fee here doesn't cover much and only seems to be an additional fee to increase their bottom line. Now even with the fee, It was a better price than the other hotels with a price of $38 a night for a Thursday and Friday night with major conventions in town. That being said I don't think I will be staying here again. I am in Vegas twice a year at least for work and think I will stick with the hotels I know and have stayed at many times in the past."
1,"I've stayed everywhere in Las Vegas and know good hotels when I see them. Since the rate was so cheap, I didn't have high expectations.  Imagine my surprise when the room, the furnishings, the decor and the hotel amenities were as good as anywhere!  A little noisy at night, but it's Vegas -- who cares?  You can't beat the convenience to everything."
0,"Ordered takeout which included chicken fried rice. It had a fishy shrimp taste and I called them up to complain. Their response was they can give me a free entree the next time I order. Well the problem with that response is, I WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN. The correct response would have been a refund of $8.25 of the total $50.66 charge."
1,"Just the thought of eating Ticoz enchiladas gets me excited. Although a little pricey for lunch, the chicken enchiladas are so amazing I keep going back. The 2-dollar taco Tuesday special is a good deal. I usually just stick to the enchiladas through -  nothing beats them. \n\nThe ambience and service is great as well. We usually sit on the patio. There are cute little couches along the side and it's partially shaded. The inside is nice too, but I would recommend it as a good choice if you're looking to eat outside."
1,"Literally the nicest, most sincere, excited employees I have seen working at a fast-food establishment. Never had a problem with the food or drinks. The rest of it is an average Taco Bell, but every single time I go, even through the drive-thru for a quick drink, the employees are the nicest people ever."
1,"Absolutely gorgeous interior with a Southern plantation feel. I love a menu that accommodates foodie adventurers and more conservative eaters. Seafood options, ridiculously delicious looking burgers that are practical to eat (not so big around that a normal sized person can't bite into it), and decent salad options for someone trying to eat relatively light.  That being said- anyone who goes to The Henry and doesn't get the truffle oil fries is missing the boat. I'm actually dreaming about them as I write this.  For the folks who prefer to drink their calories, no shortage of options here either. Great cocktail menu, wide selection of carefully chosen beers and a wide selection of wines. This place is the perfect happy hour spot. BONUS- the interior is acoustically pleasing as well. No straining to hear the person across the table from you. It was so inviting for conversation that we actually met and shared an appetizer with the two wonderfully witty gentlemen that sat down next to us. NICE!"
0,"I've been coming here since before the name change and have always liked the atmosphere, coffee, and staff but have stopped coming here frequently because they have taken away what makes all independent coffee shops great, free wifi. \n\nWifi is made available only to paying customers (understandable), but on an incremental system. Spend $4-$7 and get 1 hour. \n\nValue has been shifted from the customer to the customer's wallet and has made madhouse more of a \""get in and get out\"" coffee shop than a \""come enjoy a drink and get some work done\"" shop.\n\nMadhouse has lost much of its appeal and I have switched to nearby competitors, independent and corporate, who offer a relaxed atmosphere, fair coffee, and unlimited wifi."
1,Thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. Our 8 year old refused to try the sushi but loved the chicken teriyaki. The 12 year old got yakitori that was a little dry but still thought it was good. We liked trying new rolls we haven't tried before and the fact that we all got full for $30. Yes there are better sushi places but the sushi was still good here and the conveyer belt entertained the kids.
0,"Went around 5pm and didn't encounter a line which is quite astonishing.  For that I should be much more grateful than just 2 stars, but the service was quite odd there.  The woman at the counter just kept jumping to conclusions and trying to rush us out without any apparent reason.  We were trying to decide whether to refuse the package and have it returned to sender for free, or pay the fee to return it so that we could have a tracking number.  The result would be the same, but we would trade some security for essentially free shipping.  Well the lady just kept trying to do one thing without answering all of our questions.  Anyways, when I left I couldn't help but think I did the wrong thing -- never a good feeling when you leave any business.  They also don't have an automated postage machine that you could use to mail packages without going to the counter or perhaps use after hours.  Perhaps they close the lobby afterwards, therefore one of those machines is not necessary, who knows, hope others have better service."
0,"Ok, with all the advertisement and commercials on tv, I've wanted to try Applebees for awhile. \n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, it wasn't crowded at all. The bar had. a couple of people and only a couple of tables were filled. \n\nFirst of all, service was very slow. It wasn't busy so I couldn't figure that one out. Secondly, I thought it was a little odd that our waitress kept sitting down at a table diagonal to our where a baby and man were eating periodically. Later, I realized that must have been her baby and significant other. Even if the restaurant was slow, I thought that was unprofessional. \n\nWe got the meal deal for $20 that came with an appetizer and two meals. \nThe mozzarella sticks appetizer was pretty good but just like any other place. I got steak which I asked for medium rare and it was cooked well the steak was pretty chewy. My companion had some pasta dish that wasn't so good. \n\nSo overall, price was about the only thing that was good. It kind of reminded me of chili's but I thought Chili's back home in Hawaii was better. it seems like it would be a good family place. But I definitely was disappointed.  ^_^*~"
1,"Tia Jackson is a phenominal stylist!  If you are looking for a stylist for hair color, extensions or hair cuts she is the best.  She truly listens to what style you want and delivers every time.  Best extensions professional in Charlotte!!"
0,"I am sorry but I can't pay $25 for a drop in yoga class. I can go to 2 yoga classes at most places in the valley for this price. I did loved going here when it was less pricey, the classes are really fun, most of the teachers play upbeat music to keep the class motivated.  The classes are more fun than a spiritual practice, but if you are looking for a good time after work that doesn't involve booze and you have money coming out of your ears...check this place out!  Please At One Yoga, have a heart for us students!!  Lower your prices!!"
1,Fast service and a great haircut for my husband.
0,"I called Wave Cleaners based on the reviews on Yelp and also because they are located right near our house.\n\nWhen I called to set up the appointment I was impressed, the gentleman on the phone was very helpful. We set up an appointment for a deep cleaning for the following week. I had family coming in from out of town for our wedding and I didn't want to add deep cleaning to my to-do list the week before the wedding. I asked if we could get the widows washed too. He said they would do that no problem.\n\nThe day of the appointment the cleaners arrived on time. I talked to them about what I wanted them to focus on and make sure to take care of then I left to run some errands. I had to put the dogs in the back yard, so told them not to worry about the outside of the back windows.\nI came back 3 hours later as they were packing up to leave. I did a quick sweep through the house and I was pretty speechless. I did not say anything at the time and I should have. \n\nThe floors looked as if there had been a quick sweep/mop over them, but nothing more than I could have done in 10 minutes. This was one of the areas I asked them to give extra attention. The shelves were dusted, none of the picture frames were. There was a spot on the mirror in the dining room that I had been meaning to wipe, it was still there after they left. The cabinets were wiped down but you could see dust spots that they missed as they haphazardly wiped. The stainless steel was wiped, but had to be redone because it had greasy residue left from the product they used to clean it.\nNone of the windows were done, even though this was one of the main requests I had when I initially contacted them.\nThe cleaning that was done on my house was nothing special. It was what I do myself every few days.\n\nAfter they left I re-mopped all the floors, I re-cleaned the stainless steel, I re-dusted. I washed the windows and wiped the mirrors and pictures down.\nHad I known I was going to have to add re-cleaning the house to my to-do list 4 days before our wedding I would have saved my money and not hired Wave Cleaners."
0,"Bachelor Party Weekend!\n\nSo we dropped the big $$ and got a 2 bedroom suite! The suite itself was freaking amazing. Definitely 5 star worthy. It had a tub, huge projector screen, super modern feeling and really nice.\n\nThen why the 1 star? The service here absolutely sucked. For example:\n\n1. Asked the cleaning staff to clean the room. Came back, and.... they made one bed. No new towels.\n\n2. Called for some towels. Was put on wait for 15 minutes...\n\n3. Called concierge to ask a question. Put on wait for 15 minutes, transferred to the wrong people. Transfered again to the wrong people. Gave up.\n\n4. Called asking if we could get some toiletries. Was told no. Person hung up.\n\n5. We wanted to book a Cabana. Apparently that's impossible unless you physically go out to the pool, hunt down one of the Cabana workers. Great...\n\nJust in general, the place looks amazing until you want some help from the staff. Then you might as well bend over and kiss your rear.\n\nNow normally that's not a 1 star, but the thing is this is Vegas. Going to any 4 star + hotels you will never have this crappy of service."
0,I really loved the GOBO!  Just kidding!  Gobo is not Carrots!  I guess im picky with Japanese food and still looking for the magic spot in LV.
1,Oh my goodness. This place is Great!!!! I have been driving through Wickenberg for 30 years and never knew of this place. See Dave! What a charming man.  Stop. Do yourself a favor and eat here. Oh my god. Couldn't be better. I love it!!!!!!!!!! Nn
1,"Great place if you're downtown: I'm usually not, but I haul my hungover ass down regularly when I'm in Montr\u00e9al, 'cause the place is fucking good. Fine shots (Intelligentsia Black Cat is the standard); excellent cappuccino; and really nice fresh baked goods. Friendly baristas. Go."
1,"OH!  I could get fat from their chips and salsa!\n\nI love going to Veracruz for lunch!  I work in Oakland and have a number of \""mexican\"" restaurants at my disposal (including big chain Chipotle and Qdoba) but will 9 times out of 10 go for the 'Cruz!  It's so much more authentic.  I feel like the chef's only speak Spanish (at least that's how the cashier communicates with them) and there is always some Spanish soap opera or talk show on adding to it's authenticity.  Never usually packed- it's quick and filling.\n\nTotally worth a try!\n\n-10% off for students (or appearing to be under 22)\n-Free chips and salsa with my takeout order everytime\n-Cheap and delicious\n\nLoves it..."
0,"The worst part of MGM. Will never come again. The prime rib and fish were the only thing can enjoy, the salmon made me even not sure what I was eating."
1,"For Native Charlotteans and those who have been in Charlotte long enough to remember The Fish Market across from Southpark, the owner of Bentley's used to work there. In any case, Bentley's on 27 offers a wonderful dining experience with a great view. \n\nWe started with the Oysters Bentley (yum) and Tuna carpiccio. We had stuffed shrimp and halibut dishes for our entree. Both of which were beautifully executed! Our wine selection was Far Niente (an excellent wine for those who don't care for overly buttery/ too-heavily-oaked Chardonnay). Instead of dessert, we opted to have Port and Cognac after dinner... ahh... the good life! However, as we were there for a birthday celebration, we did end up njoying a birthday sweet after all! \n\nThroughout the evening, our server was very attentive, entertaining, and was a true professional - which sadly, in this day & age is no longer a given (even at this level of restaurant). \n\nSince this place is a splurger, we haven't been back yet, but will certainly go again for another special occasion!"
0,"They've lowered the price - and Everything Else.\nAt 6:00 PM on a Friday many items in the buffet were dried out and tough. Service was below average. At one point I just got tired of waiting on a refill and walked into the service area and refilled my own glass. This was the Seafood Buffet, at a higher price, however from what I saw most of the seafood swam away from this Buffet. They should be ashamed of calling this a Seafood Buffet. You can do Much better in Vegas for the $ 17.00 spent on this lower quality buffet. And did I forget to mention it was almost an hour wait from entering the line to being seated."
1,"this place really rocks!...the food is delish...we dont mind the drive from the strip to come and enjoy some good food, drinks, and live musicos!!! the tacos al gobernador are yummy and the pulpitos are a must try! dont leave vegas without stopping by!"
0,"A previous reviewer Douglas G. has already stated all I would have liked to state. Just to clarify, here are the negatives:\n\n1. Had no clue about my reservation. Then they said they'll give me a suite. They gave a regular room. The receptionist had an attitude as if she was doing me a great favor at 1am in the morning.\n\n2. The bathroom tub had chipped surface which looked ugly.\n\n3. The double doors to adjacent room did not have proper insulation at the bottom which meant too much noise came in. And they had repair works going on next door.\n\n4. WiFi was $14.99/day + taxes. It was not clear whether this was covered by the $15/day resort fees.\n\n\nThe positives:\n\n1. Good movie theater.\n\n2. Good swimming pool.\n\nWould I back? Only if I get deeply discounted prices and have nowhere better to go."
1,"Whoa. Nikki delivers yet again!!\n\nFood: True Pizza had their beautiful pizza truck parked outside and they were cranking the pies out like nobody's business! Tasty combinations ranging from the ordinary to the extraordinary! My favorite was the BLT flatbread that they put out. So.freaking.good.\n\nBeverages: Red, White, RyePA?! I skipped the wine and went for the beer. Sierra Nevada hooked it up. We had plenty of RyePA to drink throughout the evening and even got to take some home!\n\nFun: Pinot's Palette was a wonderful host. They truly made me feel super welcome. Which I appreciated, as I was a bit apprehensive about my lack of creative right-brainedness... Our instructor and assistants were all super friendly, helpful and encouraging! I enjoyed the structure of the class, though I wish I had a bit more time at the end. Overall, I was happy with how my masterpiece turned out :) \n\nI can't wait to come back for another night of painting fun!"
0,"So maybe I just have crappy luck with this place but every time I go in, which isn't often, they run out of chicken. Ugh. How does a chicken place repeatedly run out of chicken? And every time I go in I wait forever and a day for my order. The two stars are because the food is decent and the cashier was friendly.\n\nI'd like to say I wont be back but...."
0,"Now two stars...  Went this past weekend for lunch and enjoyed the patio.  Nice to be outside, but they need more tables that accommodate more than 2 people.  Also, the queueing system is still a nightmare.  Still confusing.  Plus our food took a long time to come out...\n\nAnother thing I didn't like was that when I was getting silverware, I looked at the spoons and there was one with a big chunk of lettuce/spinach on it.  Gross.\n\nIf the food wasn't good and they didn't keep sending me two-for-one coupons, I wouldn't go here..."
0,"Ambiance: more of a party party group Italian place than a quiet romantic dinner for 2 or family outing type of place.  The back room has tall bushes carved into the silhouettes of busty ladies.  What do I say when little Johnny asks, \""Mommy, why are those trees shaped like girls with big boobs?\""  \n\nFood: portions are big (again, better for groups!)  The meatballs are half a pound each and the spaghetti dish could have fed a family of 4.  The food has good flavor though, especially the balsamic glaze on the filet mignon.  The house spaghetti with seafood is delicious, but beware that it is a bit spicy so if you have people who can't eat spicy at all, you might want to ask them to tone it down a bit.\n\nService: a little on the slow side, especially on busy nights.  We saw a waiter rushing to bring a table some shrimp scampi who was leaking buttery garlic sauce all over the floor and on the backs of a few couches near the bar.  Hope no one slipped on that.  Lastly, be prepared to wait after dinner to take the elevator back down if it's past 11pm as patrons are being shuttled up to the club.  We waited for 12 minutes exactly and I had to ask the hostess twice if she was sure the elevators were working."
0,"I've been here twice to check out the facility.  Each time as soon as the door opens, I'm blown away by the overwhelming smell of urine and explosive diarrhea.  This entire place needs to be doused in bleach.  The staff is terrible.  I can't put enough emphasis on \""terrible\""  they are rude, they don't care and if they treated me that way, I can only imagine how they treat their patients when no one is looking.  There is one nice person that works here, Deshawn, she is the receptionist at the front desk and a total sweetheart.\n\nThis is the third Life Care Center in Phoenix that I've encountered.  They are ALL terrible rehabilitation facilities, they all smell the same and have the same careless staff.  If you care about your loved one that needs to recover from a surgery, DO NOT put them in a Life Care Center."
0,Not the best gelato I've had in the states.  A little grainy and had some ice in it too.  I would try somewhere else.
1,Couldn't be more pleased with the guys at Gaia. Not only was the bouquet beautiful but I was stuck late with jury duty on valentines day and they were kind enough to wait for me to get out.
1,"Simply our favorite restaurant, hands down! Service & food is old world elegant. I feel like I'm on an oceanliner in the Queens Grill(QM2)The Beef Wellington/Chateau Briand is just perfect. The Foi Gras is cooked to perfection. Not fancy like Mistral(Boston)but done traditionaly(sauteed).The same for the \""Sweet Breads\"",nice & crispy. The wine & service are second to none, with waiters that have been there for years & are like family! \n The desserts are fantastic. They come by with a dessert \""cart\"" & choose your dessert.There is a great selection of cheeses to choose from,as well. If you love true \""fine\"" dining, then this is the place.I love the Doversole,but you need to order it at least a day ahead. It's not on the \""menu\"", but they do have it. \n I read \""Steve G's\"" response & he said it perfectly. Nice to see someone who loves what fine dining is all about."
1,"love their red velvet pancake! but the place is kinda small, we have to wait for half an hour. service is good and the food, i guess the wait is all worth it."
1,"Just finished an incredible dinner at Hana after many months of hearing about how mind blowing the food is. Here's what I have to say: I can still taste the flavors of each dish and sushi medley in my mouth and on my teeth! My tongue is so happy - and so am I! The service was attentive, the food peaked my interest and Lori (chef/owner) challenged me to push beyond my comfort zone and try new things. The result? A new-found passion for favors I've never experienced and a love of uni shooters! Anyone looking for an authentically beautiful/playful dinner - go Hana!"
1,Have been wanting to check this place out for a while and so glad I finally did! Awesome service...sat at the bar...the curry lamb skewers with mango chutney was to die for and surprising the sushi was amazing as well. Got a cupcake to top the night off and it sadly was no good...lacked flavor but overall I would definitely go ahead!
0,"STAY AWAAY! \nOrdered at 11pm, 2 hours later still didn't arrive, i called to ask where was it, they hanged up and now they are not picking up, worst service ever."
0,"Bought our tickets right there in line for $14 per person (4 of us).  Our group consisted of 21, 30, 46 & 47 year olds.  It was daytime so the line wasn't long at all and moved quickly.  We got to the front of the line and are told we can't take our bags on the ride and they pointed towards lockers.  We put our stuff away and they took us next in line so no extra waiting just wondering why the people who sold us tickets never said anything about our stuff?!?  Benefit was those lockers were more convenient when we exited the ride.\n\nThis is the worst roller coaster I've ridden in a long time.  There isn't a good place to put your hands and it bounces you around so badly that it gets uncomfortable while riding.  I found myself wishing it would just end.  When it ended, our bodies were already sore and then the next day we all felt worse.  My shoulders actually felt bruised for several days following our ride.\n\nMy daughter and I had ridden this coaster about 10 years ago (at night) and do not remember it being like this. \n\nI do agree with other reviews that riding at night is awesome with all the lights of the strip.  But I wouldn't ever stand in that long line to ride this coaster again unless I know it's been redone!"
0,"Our \""SUITE\"" was awful!!!\n\nThe outlets were falling out of the walls, the room smelled awful, and the room was VERY dated.\n\nWILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!"
1,"When we first moved here, we stayed at the M resort and took advantage of their spa.  The staff is great- incredibly friendly and the spa itself is wonderfully relaxing. \n\nBut the 5 stars is really based on Anthony in the salon.  \n\nHe is not only a superb stylist, he totally understands what we want and explains what he's doing and why.\nPlus, he blew us away by remembering who we were, with details, the second time we came in.  Anthony has long term clients in us- and I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an excellent stylist."
0,"Stayed in this hotel my first time in Vegas, back in 2005... I thought it was like staying at the Bellagio back then (rookie)\n\nI've been going to Vegas every other year. This year it was the \""Reunion, the comeback\"" to The Monte Carlo.\n\nTsk Tsk Tsk.. no impressed. I'll start off with the Pros:\n1-The location! muy bueno. you can walk to any popular spot or nightclub from this hotel \n2-The Tram: ok if you don't wanna walk (see#1), then you can take the tram that can take you from the Monte Carlo to the Aria Hotel to the Bellagio\n3- the Pool: 3 different pools, one with waves!..... really mellow (except Saturday, it was poppin'!), really hot servers, and it  also has a volleyball court (not, that ur going to vegas for a pick up game of Volleyball, but just so u know)\n4- ask for comp late checkout..you just might hit the jackpot and get it for frrrrreeeee!\n5- not bad for the $$ BUT........\n\nOnce you enter the \""deluxe\"" rooms with strip view:\n(Cons):\n1- the carpet in the room look outdated, old, somewhat dirty.\n2- The \""Deluxe\"" part of the deal for our room... i wasn't feelin' it. It felt like we were staying in a Motel 6. It had no fridge, not microwave, small bathroom\n3- can't BYOD to the pool area\n4- food court staff are rude, terrible, incompetent: (Starbucks: couldn't get the most basic, simple, easiest drink to prepare, right: a Chocolate milk. really!? Banana bread: bad.\nSbarros (sp): gave an incomplete order and when i made brought it up to them they were making a big deal as if I was trying to get a free meal... \nMcDonald's:.... just don't go there.\n\n\nThe score is tied at 1 for now, 1 good experience (2005), one not so good (2013),  we'll see next time...."
1,"Tried to different Fat Tuesdays, this one is by far the best! My drinks were fantastic. Very strong and well worth the money! I was able to get a pink cup, I was ecstatic about that as the location before didn't have them they also had different flavors. I only have a few complaints the first night we walked all the way from palms place hotel to use this location we made it in time and the place was closing as we showed up (early). Close on time people. You lost two customers! We went back the 2nd night because this one had such good ratings, and it was extremely busy. They didn't have the drink I had gotten before, can't remember what one but it was blue, so I ended up getting the hurricane here. I wanted a sample because, well, who wants to pay 32+ bucks for a drink they may not like, so we went in to ask and he said it would be a dollar for a tiny sample. I'm assuming because there were a bunch of people in there just getting sample after sample and I think we're trying to get drunk for free, so the bartender was getting pissed. My fianc\u00e9 went with gut and went ahead and bought me one. Turns out it was awesome, deff could taste the rum. The only thing that sucks is this place is clear in the back of caesars palace, do its a walk but it was worth it and better then the other one we had gone too. If we are ever in Vegas again we will come back."
0,I wish I could give 0 stars. The employees here are disrespectful. The lady doing nail my said the color I chose was ugly... Well good thing they aren't her nails! And the lady I spoke to because I was unhappy with this disrespectful comment. Didn't even care enough to say I will speak to her or anything worst customer service ever! Oh yeah it's my birthday!
0,"Wanted to have delivery and surely did not want italian. Went on eat24 and ordered a bbq burger fries.granted it was delivery and food cools down, but if i need to warm it to make it mediocre edible, wtf. Burger was good, being smart to have it well done(even though i know it was nuked) and i know cause it came w an onion ring and the ring was unedible. Pls. Dont get me started w the Islys bbq sauce. Gues s i was really hungry"
1,"Great pho!  I had 27, rare steak and well-done brisket.  It was great. My wife had 35, pork vermicelli, which she found good but not great.  The best part, however, was the appetizer, the meatballs. Great meatballs and fresh ingredients to make you own wraps. Look forward to going again."
0,"Bon. On nous a dit que l'endroit \u00e9tait adapt\u00e9 pour les grands groupes, alors pour la f\u00eate d'une amie on se retrouve environ une vingtaine de personnes pour souper. Finalement, les si\u00e8ges manquent un peu, on doit s\u00e9parer le groupe sur les divans et les tables qui m\u00eame en \u00e9tant coll\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e0 la m\u00eame hauteur, alors c'\u00e9tait un peu sp\u00e9cial. Le staff est bien sympa (shooters de bienvenu gratuits pour le groupe!) mais on a du attendre environ 1h15 pour recevoir nos assiettes, ce que je trouve assez inacceptable. Ce fut tout aussi long pour les factures \u00e0 la fin. Pour la bouffe, je crois que tout le monde s'entend pour dire qu'on a pas eu de r\u00e9v\u00e9lation gustative divine en mangeant mais c'\u00e9tait correct, j'ai tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le fait qu'ils fassent ais\u00e9ment des substitutions aussi (j'aime pas la guacamole, on met du pico de gallo et bingo!). Le menu est atroce \u00e0 lire, surtout avec la faible luminosit\u00e9 de la place, et faites attention, la facture monte assez vite! Je suis plate hein? Je m'excuse, j'aurais voulu faire un review plus positif mais j'ai sinc\u00e8rement trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a moyen..\n\nDonc en gros, je suis contente d'y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 une fois, mais si j'ai envie de mexicain (ou si j'ai envie de boire/manger avec des amis dans la vie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), El Zaziummm ne sera ni dans mon top 10, ni dans mon top 50 mettons.."
1,Once again I used them for another room. the flooring I wanted was on back order. Manny was good keeping me updated. I wan't in a rush to have it installed but once it was in Manny want to install the next day. Unfortunately I wasn't available.   Floor likes great. Can't wait to replace flooring in another bedroom.
0,The outside and the inside is clean and looks like a Caribbean cafe but the food doesn't taste like it.
0,"This gym needs a remodel!!!!! It is so outdated for the area and clients that consistently come here. If they even read these do something with this place!!! There are way better places popping up now and I more and more likely will be changing soon, this isnt worth $30 a month"
1,"I had never heard of Lucille's until I won a gift card for 50$. I heard through the grapevine to make reservations and I am glad that I did. \n6:30 on a Sat night and it was packed, the bar, the outside patio, and the dining area, hardly a free table in the house. \nI loved the decor-- like I was visiting a family member's house in the South which made the place a very family/kid friendly environment. \nThe wait staff was very friendly and attentive even with the place being so busy. Some one was always asking us for refills and giving us an update on our order.The tables were busy quickly and often. \nI ordered the grilled salmon which was a very large piece of fish and a huge side of vegetables-cooked perfectly. My other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich. The mashed potatoes were a hit at our table. \nWe didn't have room for dessert so next time we may just order appetizers and dessert. As we left a small band was setting up in the bar area... This place was going to be rocking for hours to come.\n(PS. our bill came out to $50.77 so that was perfect deal with our gift card)"
0,"We actually got a call from the resort manager Bryan Askins who was very disappointed with what we had experienced . He promised to wow us next time we visit. We'll see what happens. \nLady's and Gentlemen stay toon. I will update.   \n\n This is the first time we are staying at Cosmo, reason one of our friends recommended. Now we booked it through Southwest Airlines and the minute we arrived the whole thing turned completely around. Cosmo rep is saying we have to take a room that has 2 beds but hey we are here with our spouses so I don't think that kind of makes since. I called the manager Gavin the ignorant person he was ( I don't know who appointed this guy a manager ) he could not do anything for us. Anyway people be careful when you book a room make sure you get them to send you your confirmation of what you have reserved actually. I always stayed at Wynn and never ever had an issue. I guess the class of the Casino says a lot. Shame on the management shame."
0,"This is my second time having a problem w curbside. The food is good but the process has caused delays with no service recovery. The delays impact food quality. \n\nToday I ordered curbside. Pick up, pay, and tip (about 18%). I leave get close to home and they phone me that they gave the wrong order. Turn around, go back to get correct order I am offered a desert. \n\nServer took the original bag from my car and placed it to the car next to mine.  Pretty sure he should not have done that. \n\nThis is my second issue w curbside and the recovery and process delivery failures are a reflection of poor management and decision making. \n\nRecovery should have been redo both orders and provide a comp'd meal upon next visit."
0,After almost two years of taking our dog here the owner told us she was a bad client and wasn't welcome there anymore.  I'm not even really an animal person and if I read this I would think the person had a difficult animal and didn't realize it - but I took the dog to another groomer and they said she has no behavioral issues at all.  But I noticed whenever I dropped the dog off at Wag N Tails that she would get all stiff and nervous - try to leave - I just thought she didn't like the groomers but she was fine in the new place.  I always thought the owner was a grump but the one gal that works there and does the grooming is SO nice and very kind.  The owner seems like one of those folks who had been doing the same job for too long and is way over it and takes it out on everyone.  People like that don't belong around animals.  I should thank them for their lack of patience because now my dog is happer.
0,"I really wanted to like this place., but it was not meant to be.\n\nMy husband and I are picky Italian eaters, and unfortunately the Fettuccine Alla Friulana was just almost forgettable, and redundant. We had the Fradiavola pizza, which was ok -  However, it was the mixed drinks that we ordered that saved our experience here - nothing else.\n\nOue waiter took our order, but was hardly there. He brought out our mixed drinks quickly, but my husband had asked for water (and if you have walked the strip, you are thirsty!) and we did not get water until 15 minutes after we had been seated, our food came much later."
0,"Looking for a quick meal and a place to watch some football, I stumbled upon this place. Although not a looker, the place was packed, so there was hope for a good meal here. Then I opened the menu.... $15 salads, $13 hot dogs, $35 dry aged steaks... Seriously, is anyone ordering a $35 dry aged steak at a sports bar? I opted for a quesadilla and a Heineken, then bounced asap. Staff was friendly, but this was a one and done dining experience. \n\nTip: If you're looking for a quick meal, suck it up and hit up the BK Whopper bar instead."
1,"The Hospitality Suites was very accommodating of our large group. They arranged for our group to be in the same area and were both friendly and helpful for our entire stay. The rooms were clean and provided amenities that made our stay feel like home. The cooked breakfast, shuttle service, and free happy hour were a great bonus! We hope to stay here again in the future."
1,"OMG!  I love living downtown for so many reasons.  And I got to add Torched Goodness to my list tonight.  I first encountered this gourmet food truck at the Wednesday Public Market on Bastille Day.  They were hosting a French Dessert Smackdown.  I got to sample the lavender creme brulee, which was heavenly.  But tonight, thanks to social networking, I learned before I even left work that food trucks would be on my very street for First Friday tonight.  My friend and I rode our bikes the mere block to the corner lot, where we once again encountered Torched Goodness.\nA cursory inspection of the menu revealed the clear winner: maple creme brulee with the optional carmelized bacon topping.  We're talking organically raised bacon and local sourced dairy.  Torched before your very eyes!  It should probably be illegal.  It's that good.\nDude is a serious foodie and localist.  And a super-friendly guy.  He's Le Cordon Bleu trained and loves what he does so much that you just feel good sitting at his folding table.  I give Torched Goodness my whole-hearted 5 stars."
1,"I love this new spot in Surprise. It's great for families during the hot summer days! Surprise really needed something fun for kids and families. For the 21 plus crowd - the private VIP area called The Approach has a full bar and 10 lanes of private bowling. I'm thinking about renting this room out for my next birthday party!\n\nThe place gets crowded, so call and make a reservation. \n\nI tried the food, and it's much more than typical bowling alley food. They have pizza, salads, wings, everything! Their cocktail list is also robust. \n\nGo during happy hour to get discounts on appetizers and drinks. YUM!\n\n2 thumbs up!"
1,"I visited Italy recently and when I came back I decided I wanted to try to find some similar quality Italian food here in Pittsburgh now that my standards are higher after having the real deal.  Pizzaiolo did not disappoint.  They had a pasta with an all'Amatriciana sauce I had only seen before in Italy, and I also had their lasagne bolgnese and a fresh buffalo mozzarella appetizer.  All were amazing and on par with the quality I found in Italy.  They also had a nice selection of Italian craft beers which I've never seen anywhere else in the US before.  I just wish they'd include some English descriptions of them on the menu!  All the staff there is also very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere feels more like a gourmet brick oven pizza place than a nice Italian restaurant, but they definitely have a lot more to offer than their pizza (which is also excellent)."
1,"\""Maple Pecan Granola Cereal\""\nLove It. I can eat it all day long.\nBut I have to leave it alone, too much sugar! Getting old and I was forced to start a new diet :-(\n\nGreat store for organic here in Charlotte."
0,"I've gone a couple of times for service, but after this last time, I don't think I'll be going back.\n\nReason for last visit: Full detail\n\nThe good: \n - The detail was well done.\n - Bruce is a nice guy.\n\nThe bad:\n - I had to call 3 times in order to get them to schedule the detail for the correct weekend.\n - When I showed up, the had only scheduled for an inspection, not a detail.  The end result was that they couldn't get to detailing my car until the next business day, which was a Monday.  So I was out of a car for the entire weekend.\n - The reason they gave me for not getting to it on Saturday was weak.  Instead of apologizing for screwing up on the requested service, I was told that it takes a long time to detail my car because of the color of paint.  *sigh*\n - They inspected my car anyway.  It may have been complementary, however I would have rather they just detailed my car, (I just had it tuned up a couple of weeks earlier).  The result of the inspection was that I \""needed\"" a) a new engine air filter, b) a new cabin air filter, and c) new spark plugs, (all of which were replaced two weeks prior during it's regular tune-up at another shop).  They were asking for an additional ~$190 to replace the above.  That, sirs and madams, is outrageous.  \n\nIf you're familiar with your car and are able to use the word \""no\"", and have a flexible schedule, (or don't experience a scheduling mix-up), then you'll be all right.\n\nI understand that the service guys are under a lot of pressure to sell expensive parts, and get people in and out quickly.  So I don't place all of the blame on the staff, (as you-know-what usually rolls down hill).  But I'm not in the mood to play dice with this place anymore."
1,"Originally the boyfriend, boyfriend's mom, and I went to Lake Las Vegas to have lunch at Black Pepper Grill, but they were closed... We discovered Bernard's Bistro and thought we'd give it a try.\n\nThe waiter was very nice and friendly. Since it was at the end of the lunch hour, we had the restaurant to ourselves. Nice decor inside and we sat next to the Frank Sinatra wall.\n\nI got the Caribbean salad (don't remember the full name) w/a curry dressing. The waiter said it was there top selling dish and I could see why. It was delicious!!\n\nThe waiter also suggested we come back on the weekend, where they have live music, show films, and have all sorts of fun outdoor activities.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, great service, and great food.\nI will be going back to see try there dinner menu and enjoy the night time activities by Lake Las Vegas."
0,"Beautiful soundtrack, good visuals, messy choreography..\n\nI cannot say I am impressed. I have seen numerous Cirque du Soleil shows (Mystere, Dralion, Quidam, Ovo, O, Zumanity, and Zarkana) and decided to give La Reve a shot after coming back to Vegas. However, the stunting and acrobatics performed in La Reve really cannot compare to those of Cirque for a couple of reasons.\n\n1) Sustainability - A Cirque act lasts for maybe 10 minutes but a La Reve act lasts for maybe 5 minutes. The performers in La Reve just do not have the strength and stamina to pull through stunts continuously. They break out in dance in between to take a breather.\n\n2) Artistry - Overall, I felt that La Reve's choreography is incredibly messy. Many of the routines are replayed over and over again (such as synchronized swimming) and hence, there is not much creativity. Props to the Latin ballroom dancing scenes, but that isn't exactly a wow factor for a show that's supposed to rival Cirque.\n\n3) Humor - Cirque clowns do an amazing job at making people laugh. La Reve tried to input some humor but the \""clowns\"" in La Reve could not pull it off. Many of the jokes were overused and expected.\n\nWith all that being said, the soundtrack of La Reve is amazing and I enjoyed how the performers walked/performed their way down the aisles so if you are planning to see it, definitely get an aisle seat!"
0,"I've been to Smashburger a total of three times. Two of them happened to be at this particular location on Maryland Parkway right next to the UNLV campus. My experiences have been \""okay\"" but more like... hey, I've had better burgers than this experiences. Therefore the 2-star rating must be awarded, especially after the visit I had last night after work.\n\nAll day I was looking forward to trying out the Baja Burger. I wanted something spicy, something meaty, something satisfying. I figured - this would be it! I was wrong. The burger was actually quite bland, unless I happened to be biting into a jalapeno. There was only a couple times I said, \""Hey, that's spicy\"" and even less times I thought \""This burger is totally worth the price I paid for it\"". \n\nI suppose Smash-fans are lovers of all the toppings you can apply to burgers here. Perhaps the different sides you can pair with your burger as well. But to me - it's just not worth the price tag.\n\nBaja Burger - 5.99\nSmash Fries - 1.99\nCoke - 1.89\nTotal - $11+\n\nNote that Smashburger does NOT make combos. You must order these things separate. Almost 12 bucks for a burger combo? No thanks. I'll go to a sit down restaurant, pay that much and then leave a bit more for a tip. That would be better than this.\n\nOverall the food was NOT BAD. The burger's bun was actually the most enjoyable thing I had. The Smash fries were not what I expected. Yes, I tasted the rosemary, but not so much the garlic. Plus my fries were teeny tiny fries! Like, I had gotten the bottom of the entire batch! I just cannot say I was satisfied and I can say I probably would have been more satisfied if I had just gone to Inn N Out next door.  \n\n3 strikes. Sorry Smashburger, you're outta my rotation."
1,"I'm very glad this Super Target is so close to my house. It is a great store for just about anything. It's very big, well stocked, and clean. The grocery is pretty awesome. I usually buy my groceries right down the street at Fry's Marketplace but it's nice to be able to stop here on the way home to pick up any last second items for meal planning.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful. Sometimes it's hard to find somebody on the floor if you have questions or need to find something.\n\nI don't drink coffee but there's a Starbucks here also. It's a nice sit in coffee shop within the store. Pretty cool for the Joeys."
0,"The physical store is fine.  Ordering from them online is a disaster.  Did not give me the promised 25% discount.  Then I am informed that the order can't be changed or cancelled even when I informed them of THEIR mistake within 2 minutes of it occurring.  Avoid having any online involvement with them at any cost.  I called their 800 number and was informed there were only 2 senior reps that could cancel or change an order if policies permit.  However, those 2 senior reps only work on certain days and hours.  That means that every other rep can only take an order.  The help line can't help you at all.  She was nice enough to tell me that their policies changed recently when I complained, but she wasn't sure how they changed.  Good store, horrible company!"
0,"The food is good if you can get past seeing the small roaches running across the floor. I just find it hard to down my meal with small sewer roaches running across the floor.\nThe first time I went there it was take out, so I did not notice the roaches. The second time I ate there after purchasing the yelp coupon. It was then that I noticed the place has small roach problem. Yuck........"

0,"RTC's reply to my question:\n\n\""The project is defined as Rainbow to Nellis since that's where the roadway improvements will take place as far as a dedicated bus lane.  However, the route would extend to the ends as they do now on the existing Route 202.  Unfortunately the information provided on the website understandably leads people to believe an express route would only operate between Rainbow and Nellis.  If this is ever constructed, we have full intent of operating the route from the current Grand Canyon area to the Cannery and make use of the dedicated lanes between Rainbow and Nellis.\nThank you for your feedback.\""\n\nOkay, I'll take back what I said previously."
1,Stopped in on way back home from Prescott. Wanted takeout and Was super hungry 10 min before they closed on a Sunday night. They treated me like I was their first customer of the day. Sat me down at bar while I waited. Served me water and snacks. Food came up quick and away I went. First rate for service and attitude.  I have had the food before so I know it's great.
1,This hardware is very convenient and has competitive prices and they provide good service. Thank you Frank!
1,"We had a great time there, I had an issue with a venue that was happening in the hotel that then the security guy from Palazzo stepped in , he was the nicest guy and went out of his way to solve the issue , his name was ZEV and thanks to him we could go on with our night.. Very polite and friendly staff, strongly recommend this hotel.  If you go to vegas this is where you should stay..."
1,Been coming here since it opened. Close to Southern hills hospital. Free wireless Internet. Open early in the morning. Great coffee and pastries.  Especially the alcohol infused truffles! Mmm. Nice atmosphere. The music can be a little loud though. Beats generic chains like Starbucks in my book! And every 10 coffees you get one free :)
1,"Nice spot located inside of the Phoenix airport. There usually aren't too many healthy options when eating at a bar, let a lone a bar inside of an airport-- this one is no different. The beer however is delicious, I recommend the Duvall, it is a light blond brew packed with taste.\n\nI had the veggie burger and deviled eggs (bacon optional). Both were just OK.\n\nThere are a number of T.V.'s throughout this establishment for your viewing pleasure and life will move forward as planned. Keep it moving people!"
1,"Whenever I want my fix of ribs I go here and they are consistently very good, a large rack over a heaping mound of crisp shoestring fries. I've also had the short-rib which is an exceptionally generous portion with no fat just moist, juicy meat served with cheese grits. The atmosphere is \""Cheers\"" like, your friendly neighborhood pub. There is a large horseshoe shaped bar and a good size patio protected from the sun. Service is always efficient and friendly and prices are reasonable."

0,Food is average. Make sure you take all your valuables with you. Their parking lot is known for multiple break-ins a week.
0,"Gross. Advertised as best biscuits and gravy in town but a far cry from it. Just go to The Good Egg, US Egg, or even the Waffle House for better biscuits and gravy. The waitress that served us also happened to be cracked out as well - she was scratching herself, was all over the place, even took my glass of water away for no reason and then asked why I didn't have my own glass... YiKES. Avoid this place like the plague."
1,"The Madison Greenhouse Store opened sometime in April. In addition to helping you design and build your very own greenhouse, they also have staff who are very knowledgeable about all things gardening (specifically hobby greenhouses, vertical gardens, and raised beds). Whether it's succulents, edible plants, flowers, their knowledge of all things botanical will surely answer all your questions. And if not, they will find an answer and get back to you. \n\nThe store carries Purple Cow compost and potting soil and they get their seeds from Albert Lea Seedhouse. They also carry a variety of containers if you are looking to do a container garden. They also sell terrariums and air plants that they commission from Thane Wienandt. Thane also teaches classes on how to make your own terrarium (and they have another succulent class, too). \n\nStop by this store for all your specialized gardening needs, and maybe to pick up a terrarium or two. They come in all sizes!"
0,Wide selection and ok prices. I've been waiting for the last 2 hours to pick up my rental equipment. No obvious system to help service people.
0,"Good for sushi, bad for burgers!  I ordered the green monster done medium(slight pink).  this burger should have been full of flavor, but it was dry as could be with little flavor.  I mean this thing had avocado, jalepeno, pepper chipotle dressing and no FLAVOR!  Plus it was super dry and barely warm, not sure how someone dries out a burger done medium with pink in the center?  I suspect the burgers are pre done and finished off when ordered, YUCK!  Also the calamari was really chewy.  The sushi was great though, but its pretty loud in there.  I am disappointed this is what replaced The Counter burger joint."
0,"Okay, to make it short the facts:\n\n- 1.5 hours waiting\n- 50 bucks \n- drinks expensive as hell\n\nlast but not least... THE PEOPLE:\n\n\""undergraduate, snobbish girls and old sugar daddies\"". that's it. \n\nthe music is okay, the location looks pretty good, like everything in las vegas. and btw - you are separated in two classes - people with a vip private super mega lounge area, and people without.\n\nhonestly - one of the worst evenings in my life.\n\nPS: maybe this kind of clubbing is something \""special\"" for rich snobbish kids from a suburb, but not for people who now what clubbing is like in europe. don't wanna sound bitchy - but i dont understand why people like it in this club."
0,this week is Bikefest and one of the stops on the poker walk  was the Plaza Hotel. Upon entering the place smelled terrible. it's like dumping perfume in a dump trying to mask the stench. its just terrible. Went to check out the pool and it still looks terrible. The Y has a nicer pool.like I said before. it's like trying to put lipstick on a Pig. it's still a Pig
0,"Do not go with a party if 6 or more! My wife and I just had dinner with two other couples at STK. The food was good, exactly what you would expect for the prices. \nHowever, the service was shameful! Half of our group ordered salads and they all came out together perfectly and were delicious. For the main course,  4 of us ordered steaks and the other 2 ordered a seafood platter. All of our steaks were brought out at the same time but the seafood platters were not included or mentioned. After about 5 minutes I was able to flag down a busboy and inform him that we were missing 2 dinners. It took him a few minutes to hunt down our waiter and a few more minutes to bring out the food. Now our steaks have been sitting on the table for over 10 minutes while we waited for everyone to be served. And to top it off the waiter hides from us for the rest of the night and never apologizes. But you can be sure that our bill included the 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more.\nI guess since our tip was locked in the service was not important.\n\nI also want to mention the hostess Lily and busboy Rupert were very helpful and should  be commended, they were the only ones who cared enough to apologize.\n\nTo top it all off we were charged a $50 corkage fee. I know that this is the strip, but that is $20 -$30 higher then other comparable strip restaurants.\n\nFinally, for the price, the service should have been much better."
1,"Hubby took me here for my mother's brunch (and yes im just NOW making a review) ...the wait was an hour just to be called...and then it was another hour for our food. Hubby had been there before with a buddy and said the wait wasn't as bad when they were there...However, it was worth the wait. The portions were huuuuge and oh so yummie! You definitely get your money's worth. The hardest part was trying to decide which delicious menu item i was going to order. \n\nWe'll definitely go back there!"
0,"We were in Phoenix on business and went to Kincaid's for dinner. We have a gluten allergy and usually find steak and seafood places to have \""safe\"" options for us. \n\nOur waiter was friendly and asked if we had any questions on the menu. We asked if they had a gluten free menu and he said no.  Then we asked about some of the menu items to see how they were prepared so we can determine if they were gluten free.  The waiter left and sent the manager over.\n\nThe manager was very unhelpful and said everything on the menu had gluten in it. Even their mashed potatoes and all sauces and dressings.  Then we asked if we could get a grilled piece of fish with no sauce. He said all the fish was already prepared with the sauces and crusts on them. The only thing we could eat on the menu was the scallops...but they were out of scallops. He said there was a book in the kitchen of the ingredients for all of their dishes but the book was too big to look through. \n\nThe table of 5 next to us were unhappy because the manager said he was too busy to split their check for them into two payments. We were so turned off by the lack of customer satisfaction that this manager demonstrated for us and for the table next to us.\n\nAfter going through this for 45 minutes, we left frustrated and hungry and drove 5 miles to Ruth's Chris where we had the most amazing dinner you can imagine. They had a gluten free menu, amazing service and the Chefs did not miss a beat on anything!\n\nI will never go to Kincaid's again. Terrible experience."

0,"This is the worst car wash I've ever been to!  The first time I went I hated myself for tipping the car washers after I drove off and realized what a crappy job they did.  I paid for the VIP wash and ended up getting the half assed wash.  The dashboard hadn't been wiped down, I could see a large area of dust that could have easily been cleaned with one wipe.  The outside of the car still had dirty areas on the doors and back of the car. \n\nI'm crazy about having a clean car and this place is really convenient so I actually came back a second time.  It was worse!  Again, I paid for the VIP wash and you couldn't even tell the carpets had been vacuumed.  The exterior looked as good as it does when you go through a Circle K car wash.  Ugh, this place will never get another dime from me."
1,"I am forever grateful to Dr. Gaal and his careful and skilled treatment of my laceration. \n\nThis was no ordinary cut, let's just say bad enough for Clark County paramedics to say \""whoa, that's bad\"". When medical professionals in Vegas tell me something's bad, I get concerned to say the least. I declined an ambulance and managed to drive myself over to campus without passing out.\n\nNow I will say that at the front desk it was a bit absurd that the first question the lady at the front dryly asked me is \""am I registered for fall semester?\""  Now that doesn't sound too horrible except when you consider the fact that my shirt and pants are all bloody and I'm bleeding through the patch I have on. She then goes on to tell me but it's still summer, and I'll have to pay $36 for the health fee, I point to my patch and reply \""this is bad, yeah, 36 bucks is nothing compared to this\"". If that weren't enough, to add insult to injury, I was supposed to take a survey on a computer which included a question on whether I had felt depressed in the past week. How apt! In fact, I think I was getting the downers right then.\n\nI finally ask the receptionist to just be able to see somebody and I get to go to the second floor.\n\nAfter the nurse took my weight, blood pressure, and temperature, Dr. Gaal examined me. He advised me of my treatment options and clearly had experience in treating the injury I had. He took the time and care to insure that any scarring would be minimal and made sure to keep everything clean in my wound. He placed 23 stitches which was no easy task. He carefully explained to me what I would have to do at home and what precautions I would have to take. On a subsequent check-up, he answered all my questions clearly and reasonably.\n\nI quickly recovered, and the wound area is looking pretty good. I don't think I could have received better care anywhere in Vegas, nor at the low cost of 36 (student health center fee) +16 (treatment co-pay). If you don't have student health insurance or any other coverage, you're an idiot."
0,"My mother and niece from Chicago came down here and wanted to take my wife and I to this restaurant because she wanted us to experience the ambiance and service based on their restaurant in Chicago.  Unfortunately, that left a LOT to be desired here.  The first thing I tasted was the crab legs on the bar and was shocked to taste how rubbery and overcooked they were. While the meat kept coming and coming, so did my digested contents due to the horrendous aftertaste in our mouths.  I did see a dessert item I liked but refused to get it after eating this meal.  When my mother got the $131 bill for the four of us to eat, I got madder than a hornet.  She was even more upset because of the high price for subpar food.,"

1,"Family owned restaurant located in Hilldale Mall. As far as Chinese restaurants go, Hong Kong Wok is above average in quality and affordability - there's always plenty of food to eat for the price. \n\nThe food is made to order, so it's always hot and fresh, and very authentic, with freshly made soy bean milk available everyday and congee on Sundays. \n\nIt's a must-frequent place every time I visit home."
1,"Wow.  We came here as a fluke, simply because it was the only restaurant in the area that had a table on Friday at 7:00.  And what a happy fluke it was because WOW was that a good meal.\n\nThe service was amazing- absolutely top notch and entirely faultless.\n\nThe food... wow.  We opted for the sharing platter to start which was amazing.  The tempura was perfect - light, crunchy and not greasy.  The ribs were the star, though, loaded with meat and SO GOOD.  \n\nI had the shrimp pad thai as my main which was loaded with shrimp and had two massive shrimp butterflied on the side which were absolutely fantastic.  The Man had a duck dish which he loved.  I was too busy eating my own food to pay attention to his.  \n\nOur wine - a Californian Zinfandel- was also fantastic and at \u00a315.95, a steal compared to restaurants we've visited lately.  \n\nWe were hugely impressed and absolutely can't wait to return."

We usually stop at the In n Out on the way because you can bring in pretty much anything you want. But just FYI the concession is also decently priced. They have great picture and depending on your stereo, great sound :) \n\nMy one and only qualm with the drive in is the smokers. Seriously disgusting. Park in the back so no one has to smell your cancer ass sticks. Or have some courtesy to other viewers and wait the duration of the movie to kill yourself. \n\nThat is all."

I was happily surprised that I had found someone that is as much a perfectionist about my nails as I am.  My nails are so pretty and are getting healthier.  So many color and design choices too.  I have been to her twice and look forward to many more!  :)"
0,"Love the decor - they've done a great job ... too bad the food does not have equal appeal.  \n\nTried a number of appetizers and there was not a single one that stood out!  Very large bar - personal bartenders, but if they get busy, not sure they will be prepared.  Also runners who bring the food out to the bar, never know where they are going with it.  Need to work on a better system."
1,The food was delicious but the place was very noisy and the service much to be desired. However I would still recommend it because of the food!
0,"Well....tried this place again....hoping it wouldn't be as bad as the last time!  And it actually was even worse!  The kids that work here are always yelling \""Beer Money\""!  And they aren't even old enought to drink!!!  The place was so filthy...that I should of just walked back out!  The tables are absolutely disgusting!  Every single one of them were covered in a sticky dirty bacteria infested grime!!!  And the floor!!! OMG!!!  I wouldn't even let my dog walk on it if I had to!  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in  months!!!  And lets not forget about the 20\"" Bobbie I ordered to go!  These kids in here are so unprofessional...and act like they don't have a clue as to why they are standing there!!!  I told the kid....Extra mayo, cranberries and easy on the stuffing....as I would like to taste the turkey...not just a stuffing sandwich!  Well...thats exactly what I ended up with!  The 20\"" roll was so dry and hard...that you seriously couldn't even eat it!  There was about a tablespoon of cranberries on it....so little mayo that I couldn't even see it!  And Filled with stuffing and barely any turkey!!!  This is the second time I went to this location....which is why I was very clear and specific how I wanted my $14 sandwich!  It was absolutely pathetic!  I've been to other Capriotti's...and they were nothing like this one!  These kids are completely clueless.  And management are obviously a bunch of idiots!!!  If the health department came in this place....they would shut them down!!!!  This place is horrible!!!  They don't even deserve 1 star!!!!"
0,"I really, really want to like The Diamond. It's cheap, convenient to my house, and my friends like it. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times. \n\nMy friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right. \n\nThe $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh."
0,The 1 star is based on the service.  \nThis is the 2nd time in 3 weeks that I have tried to call in an order and have been put on hold for over 5 minutes. I don't know if they forgot I'm on hold or what. I called back and got put right back on hold.\nToo bad I really liked there pizza & salads.  So long Napoli....
0,"Me and my workmates slummed to the Tropicana to see the Bodies Scientific Exhibition and got hungry before we had to jet out of town.  The Garden Cafe was the only place that seemed reasonable and was open at 5pm.\n\nWHAT A MISTAKE!\n\nThe decor was repellant.  I felt like I was waiting for the Golden Girls to shuffle around the corner.  Ordering was a real ordeal, as the server didn't seem to understand his own menu.\n\nTHEN, THE HORROR BEGAN...\n\nTwo tables over, a woman gets up and starts projectile vomiting.  She starts to lumber toward our table, which was inconveniently nearest to the loo.  Her hubby seemed completely uninterested and didn't even look up from his plate.  We nearly jumped out of our skin trying to avoid the ersatz Linda Blair hulking down the aisle.  Of course, right when that trauma was over, our server comes over to offer us some soup.  Yeccch!!!\n\nThe servers didn't attempt to clean up the mess despite our repeated requests.  Repulsed, we moved to another section to avoid the stench.  The hostess actually had the nerve to come over and to order us back to our table.  EXCUSE ME, MISS?  CAN YA CLEAN UP THE BARF FIRST???  \n\nDisgusted, we bolted instead and vowed to NEVER EVER step foot in such a wretched place."
1,"One of the best sushi I've had. Ordered tuna sushi, Philadelphia rolls, dragon rolls, las Vegas rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls. Also had an excellent miso soup and mango Mochi ice cream. All were incredibly tasty and delicious. I wish I wouldve ordered their tuna sashimi. Buttery, fresh and delicious. Well worth it, considering their location at the basement of the Bally's."
1,"I have been going to Saigon Pho for years, since probably when we moved here back in 2000 or 2001 .The servers are super friendly, and remember you ,( or at least it seems that way ), the menu is fantastic. The only problem is that I don't get to try other items on the menu, since everytime I want to get my favorite. My son has been coming here since he was about 4 or so years old and is a fan also. Service is fast and friendly. If you want Vietnamese food, and don't care about decor, this is the place to go."
1,Have greatly enjoyed using your services from the mailbox to notary to copies and beyond.  You guys get it done and very efficiently.  I have appreciated your help on many occasions and will let others know you guys do a great job!
1,"Meets my expectations of a 7-Eleven. It is nice, clean, a lot of selection to choose from, and the employees were nice."
0,"if i could give a negative star i would.  actually, if i could give this show a negative 10000000000 i would.  worst performance (even outside of Vegas) that i've ever experienced.\n\nno enthusiasm from actors.  blah blah blah.  ugh.  we really wanted to walk out, but couldn't because the actors were using all the exits!  it was like they were purposely keeping us in there!  90 minutes long.  story was really stupid and elemental in its narration.   no characters were developed and you could hardly hear the lyrics when they sung (bad sound system).  and no, there is no nudity, just some whorish clothing.  and even if they were nude, it wouldn't have saved this horrid production.\n\nthe theater itself is old school vegas inside the Plaza downtown.  the 3 of us had a booth all to ourselves, which was nice, except that it was on the end, we could only see 2/3 the stage.  but it was not like we wanted to see the performances anyway, due to the horrific nature of the production.\n\nwhen we picked up the tickets from the \""box office\"", the guy said the show was SOLD OUT.  well, the place was only 1/3 full at performance.  WTF?  anyway, we paid $44 a ticket via bestofvegas.com.  \n\nin the end -- DO NOT GO.  even if the tickets are free -- DO NOT GO.  let me be the sucker who lost $150 and not you.  yes, i took the bullet for you...so if you read this and still go....well.....................you're really stupid :-)"

0,Buyer BEWARE!  I purchased a living social deal for 3 endermologie visits.  First appointment went fine.  She collected my living social voucher and I gave her a $20 tip.  The following appointments she did not show up!  She texted me that she can't make it 2 hours before a third try reschedule of my second appointment.  Debbie does not answer her phone or return calls promptly.  I have called living social and requested a refund of my 2 missed appointments.  I noticed that the BBB has several of the same complaints as I have here.  I will NOT go back to this place.  Not professional in their dealings with clients.
0,yak . nasty food.  never go back
0,"I've gotten the regular wash over the years and it's been fine but got talked into prepaying for a detail. Well it took 3 trips & a talk with the manager before they \""fit me in\"". Please please trust me- don't ever get your car detailed there!!! HORRIBLE job- they hadn't even cleaned the windows. The ac vents were covered with dust, the mirrors were spotted- sprayed but not wiped & it just looked dirty. Plus I waited 3 HOURS!!! Never ever ever again."
0,"NEVER WILL I EVER spend another dollar at Nu Sanctuary.\n\nI heard a rumor that they're closing... I hope its true because after my experience tonight, I'm never coming back.\n\nI had a Groupon that was about to expire so I figured I'd use this opportunity to try the food here. I saw John Curtas' (Eating LV) review on Nu Sanc and it peaked my interest. \n\nHOURS: A friend and I were waiting for them to open for dinner at 5pm. We as well as another group were getting impatient when the clock hit 5:05pm and no employees came to open the door. Someone from the other group got the attention of an employee and another one came out to rudely tell us that they weren't opening until 5:30 tonight... WTF? We left and I planned to return later that evening.\n\nSERVICE: I went to the bar to order food to-go. The bartender implied he wouldn't let me take the food \""to-go\"" unless I tipped him. How incredibly obnoxious. He took my $10 to cover the difference/tip and my groupon and told me he would put my order in. 20 minutes later, they drop off a container of just pita bread. I start asking questions on where the rest of my food is and every employee comes back telling me something  different. A different bartender who was actually quite polite and respectful got some answers for me and proceeded to grab the manager who turned out to be a complete Jacka$$. He said he can't do anything for me unless I have a receipt. He also can't prove any services were due because the original bartender wasn't there. To make matters worse, turns out the kitchen didn't have any of the food I ordered.\n\nI had already been there for 40 minutes and I was too frustrated to fight with this ignorant punk any longer. It wasn't worth the $10 cash or the $15 groupon to raise my blood pressure so I left. \n\nSmoke and eat elsewhere because the goods and services at Nu Sanc are done and over with.\n\nDon't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)"
0,"Sigh...where do I even start. Buffets make me very happy. I am usually excited to go to one and I find that it is usually an attraction in itself. This buffet however was not the case. There was a nice little array of desserts and the salad bar was my go to. The temperature for all main items seemed off. I'm not sure if everything had been sitting out for a long time but my food was at room temperature (a big peeve for me). The breads were stale. I only rate this 2 stars due to decent desserts and salad bar. Our waitress and hostess were fabulous but other than that this place needs some improvement foodwise. The view was beautiful as we were sitting with views overlooking the Koi ponds, flamingo,  ducks, and little waterfalls."
0,"Food was decent.  Between four hungry gentlemen we got away with 8 small plate tapas and one paella and everyone was quite full afterwards.  It's a nicely decorated restaurant in Aria. Here are some thoughts on the food:\n\n- Meatballs - these had an excellent texture and the meat sauce was perfectly sweetened.  A very enjoyable dish\n- Sliders - don't get this - only came with two sliders and the bread was a bit dry and overall not very original or inspired\n- Black rice - this is an actual dish and I found very delectable.  The price soaked in squid ink (?) was well seasoned and the octopus and seafood added some interesting texture to the bite\n- Tuna sashimi on seaweed salad - I would not order this, just get it at an actual japanese restaurant and you'll be much happier\n- Paella - definitely order this when you sit down as it takes 40 mins to cook.  We ordered the mix paella and it was very enjoyable.  The mix of chicken and seafood was nice and it wasn't overly salty.\n- Garlic Chicken - this was a surprisingly tasty dish.  It was simple but the flavor was excellent and the texture of the chicken was moist and soft on the inside with a thin but noticeable flour based covering.\n\nThe cocktails were OK but nothing to write home about.  \n\nWhy did it only get three stars?  Well our waiter who was a nice chap throughout the meal offered us an appetizer, a feta cheese, tomato, and bread type of dish.  When he offered this to us, he said \""i'll bring you out this appetizer\"".  At the end of the meal, when we ordered 4 espressos, he said \""i'm going to bring you out coffee with liquer\"".  In both cases, his tone gestures insinuated that we would be comped these small \""extras\"" but when we saw the final bill, he had charged us.  The coffee drinks alone were $14 each.  Anyways, just an annoying thing for people to have to deal with and presumptuous that we'd want to pay for the extras.  \n\nSo all in all, the food was above average but the incident with the waiter brought down the otherwise delightful experience to two stars."
1,This appears to be a recently opened market next door to the Persian Room in Scottsdale.  I think that it is tied to the Persian Room.  This market has a lot of unique things from the Caspian Sea area (Iran and Russia).  You can get caviar here if you want.  You can also get traditional stone cooked Middle Eastern flatbread. \n\nThis place is definitely worth looking at if you want anything Persian or from the Caspian Sea area of the world.
0,"Truly awful service tonight, waiting one hour for entree items and servers look totally brain dead with who gives a shit attitude."
1,"Finally a diner in Charlotte that serves delicious food in that tin box atmosphere that makes it taste just a smidge better! A friend has been raving about Mattie's for weeks, so I decided to try it out with her on Fat Tuesday - how apropos, right? The menu includes all the delicious breakfast items (served all day) and fried favorites you'd expect; if you're looking for an uber-healthy meal, this is not the place. But you won't be disappointed if you do try out Mattie's; the food/service was fantastic!\n\nMattie's is located in the NC Music Factory ; you can't miss it as it looks exactly like what you think a diner should - cramped and made of all that shiny metal. There is plenty of parking, but beware...if you try to hit Mattie's up during peak times, you may have to wait. The diner is open 24 hours Thursday - Sunday, and I bet is pretty packed at breakfast time and for those late night, post-bar snacks. We went mid-week and had no problem sitting right down.\n\nGet the pancakes. Seriously get them. You will not be disappointed. As per usual, I just had to tailor my order so I could get the set of three pancakes as different flavors. Although a serious pain for our server, he was really gracious and took care of us well throughout our meal. I ended up ordering one blueberry, one chocolate chip, and one peanut butter. The pancakes are huge, but I ended up finishing both the chocolate chip and peanut butter (together, of course - what a delish combo). I then took the blueberry home for breakfast, and it was just as good as those I ate the night before.  For a side item I ordered the home fries, which were a bit greasy (as you'd expect at a diner) but very good. I honestly couldn't have eaten them all, anyway, after shoveling in the two humongous pancakes.\n\nI've honestly been looking for a good breakfast place in Charlotte since I moved here over five years ago; in Mattie's, I've found it."
1,"Steve and his crew did a great job.  His crew was on-time and did a great job of painting.  Started off that Steve forgot the original estimate appointment, but was apologetic and came right away.  After that it was all down-hill and a great job done."
1,Its been hard to find authentic Thai here in Scottsdale but I love Thai Basil - The tom yum soup and Pad thai are both delicious and appropriately spicy - Im averaging once a week since I discovered it!
1,"Such a beautiful hotel to stay in Las Vegas to people who wish to have a vacation more relaxed, family oriented then what you can find in Las Vegas strip. \nBeautiful species rooms, very clean and comfortable. Lots of space and green. \nWe tried couple of times to come back here but it was fully booked! \nI tuck one star off because of the poor breakfast which we enjoyed in other Marriott hotels, such as the Beverly Hills one. Also because we got extra charges on the room but we settled that at the check out.\nVery recommended for people who wants to enjoy Vegas differently :-)"
0,Sorry. 3 day old rice. Food was cold and the wings were stale.  I won't be back.
0,"This place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!"
0,"Huge disappointment.  Years ago Caesar's Place had one of the best Buffets in town.  You can image my surprise to find how small it has become now.  They did have frozen crab legs, prime rib and turkey but that was about all they had.  The salad and side selection was very thin.  You can get a nice meal in one of the other restaurants for about the same price."
1,"Decent coffee, good tea. The staff is nice and that's the most important thing, really. My only complaint is that sometimes,the wifi doesn't work, even if you have the login."
1,"Charming place, great menu, nice to BYOW. The escargots are a favorite starter, and their main courses are prepared with care and always delicious. And the prices are surprisingly reasonable, even with the crummy exchange rates for USD. I try to go for dinner here at least once when I am in Montreal."
1,OMG great food I'm glad I read the reviews here before I went. Thank you to those for writing cool reviews of this place. Service is spot on. \n\nWent here for breakfast I was craving eggs benedict. My Boyfriend had ham and cheese omelet. Both dishes came out so awesome. Their fresh orange juice is so good as well. \n\nAsked for patio seating and got it beautiful views of the strip and front of the Bellagio Hotel. I will comeback here for dinner when I'm in town again.
0,"Me and my friend stayed her for NYE 2010...let's just say I checked my self for mysterious bites as I returned home. There was nothing special about the room. The interior of hotel, hallways, casinos, and room felt old. The only thing they had improved, in my opinion, was a coat of paint. Which was applied over 35 year old paint.\n\nI would never stay here again and it closely compared to my stay at the Travel Lodge, which was expected because it was a Travel Lodge and I paid for that level of comfort, or lack there of."
1,Great place for lunch. Service is good.
1,"So, the Fella and I had a great spontaneous weekend in Vegas.  Business trip layover that turned into a little holiday for us, complete with show and gambling.  Yay!  The Fella had heard through the grapevine that lunch at the Stratosphere was delicious, and a bit of a better deal than the dinner, so we tried it out before I schlepped off to the airport.  Pretty much everything on the lunch menu was around $20, and that included the price of the ride up to the top.  After our meal we were also able to go to the indoor observation deck, and would have gone to the outdoor deck as well, but it had closed due to a lightning storm.\nLet me say, I was a little nervous... not about the height, but about the rotation.  I get seriously motion sick, and even just the swaying of the tower could make me ill.  Fortunately, it seems that the circumference of the rotating area must be larger than other rotating places I've eaten, because I was able to enjoy the sweeping mountain views, and the top notch prime rib!  The Fella isn't usually an atmosphere kind of guy, but he LOVED it (the steak helped, too).  We'll be back!"
1,"To start off, this is what I'd expect to find with a hole in the wall restaurant.  The food is ethic and traditional.  Service, seating and decor are casual with the food taking the show.  The dishes are college kid priced :) and its a good selection of noodle dishes with some really unique selections.  Definitely an ideal group setting but be prepared to wait.  Good food with cheap prices take time...I'll definitely be back!!!"
0,"We have been going to their minnow salon  for 2 years now. It can be a fantastic deal. Sun,m and tues - $5 haircuts. The low review is for 2 reasons - 1. They do not take reservations so we have left several times because of a long wait. No big deal- this is what they advertise and can be worth it for a good deal. However, my second reason became a deal breaker today. We showed up in the middle of the advertised hours to be told the minnow salon was closed because they had too many other customers in the other part of the salon. They stated this happens sometimes when they are busy. This is a deal breaker for me- if you advertise hours you need to be open during those hours. We will be finding another salon for kids cuts."
1,Bought a Living Social coupon a while back and decided to go today. I was amazed at how big and spacious the cafe is. The tables aren't close together like most family owned businesses. Environment was nice. Staff was friendly and food was AMAZING! \n\nI ordered the California Omelet (posted pic) and substituted the hash browns and toast for a side of fruit and spinach in my omelet. \n\nMy bf ordered Huevos Rancheros (posted pic) and added chorizo into his scrambled egg. It was super tasty with lots of flavor.\n\nDefinitely a new go to place for breakfast and the location (silverado and bermuda) is perfect from where we live.
0,"The bathroom was very nice. \nOtherwise, overpriced drinks with lots of ice and little alcohol. Not a place to hit up.. Definitely a \""must miss.\"""
1,"Wow! This place really knows how to treat families. I was impressed. Not only do they have state of the art equipment they had lots more. Starbucks located inside building first floor. The cafeteria was a smorgasbord of South of the Border, Italian, Mongolian, pizza, burgers, salad bar, fruit bar, drink station, candy station, dessert station ...  you name it they have it!"
1,"The service is great, the food is great.  There's not really anything I can add that hasn't been said in the other reviews.\n\nOther than:  If you don't order the beignets for brunch, you are seriously insens\u00e9.  (that's 'insane' in french.  i think.)"
1,"Good priced shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, Aerosoles, Clarks, Born, New Balance, and so much more. If you have the loyalty card, you can earn discounts on purchases. Usually has an ongoing promotion, Buy One Get the 2nd Pair for 50% off. (Yeah, I know, really trying to get you to buy more without having to twist your arm.) I used to shop here a lot but lately been browsing;  still trying to figure out my final decision. (See, I've been debating buying things online to earn more miles with Hawaiian Airlines.)\n\nI like the set-up, continuous rows of shoes according to type of shoes- flip flops, sandals, heels, boots, athletic, toning shoes. All the accessories like socks are in one section. One side is womens and the other is mens. One section dedicated to clearance shoes according to size in the far right corner, for ladies. Because the set-up is easy, so is finding what you want. And there are pantyhose footie cheapies (located in boxes nearby) to wear if you're sockless. Plus, benches and mirrors to further assist you in your shoe purchase. \n\nA dependable source for all recognizable shoe brands."
1,"I totally like the idea of recycling any of your wedding attire. I tried to sell some of my wedding stuffs - sash, tiara, veil, dress at preownedweddingdresses.com  and did not really have any luck. I finally consign them to Decy - the best part is, there is no fee unless they are sold.\nDecy helped me get some money back from my expensive wedding spending and she also told me that the new bride enjoys my sash and my brooch bouquet.\nI am so glad to find out about Adore!"
1,"There is a reason Bobby Flay is an Iron Chef and owner of Mesa Grill and other restaurants... he makes simple food decadently delicious!\n\nWe had made brunch reservations one month in advance, as we knew they get booked quickly.\n\nWe arrived a little early and were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The decor was inviting and the ambience stylish and warm (see our picture).\n\nHaving gotten to know Bobby Flay's personality through watching him on the Food Network, it was pleasantly surprising to see that his staff embodies this warm personality too. \n\nOur waitress reviewed the menu with us and explained some of Bobby's signature dishes as well as making some recommendations.\n\nWhile we perused the menu, the flavorful basket of mini cornbreads and assorted small pastries was brought out to our table as were our drinks (Cactus pear iced tea, cofee and Margarita).\n\nAppetizers our party of 4 shared:\n*Goat cheese \""Queso Fundido\"" with blue corn tortilla chips - the flavor of the goat cheese dip topped with roasted peppers so full of robust rustic flavor - a solid 5 Stars! \n*Shrimp and sweet corn tamale -Bobby Flay's signature dish. Well balanced flavors, shrimp was cooked to perfection - another 5 star dish. Though the dish comes with 4 large tiger shrimp it would serve as a good appetizer for 2 instead of 4.\n\nEntrees - our waitress let us know how these were going to be cooked and at what temperature to expect them so we wouldn't have any surprises.\n*Spicy Scrambled Eggs - served with Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese, Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham and Buttermilk Biscuits - very good flavors.\n*Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash served with Poached Eggs & Green Chile Hollandaise - this flavor profile was very delicious \n*Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce\nCaramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa & Creamy Green Chile Rice - perfect balance of bright flavors and texture. The Cascabel chile sauce was so good I used the little cornbreads to dip and polish it off my plate!\n*New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise & Southwestern Fries - fantastic flavor and the southwestern fries were warm and crispy- not oily at all.\n\nThe portions were perfectly sized for brunch but we all agreed we could have eaten more of every dish that we had ordered as every bite was a burst of delicious flavor that tantalized our taste buds.\n\nThe service was attentive without being obtrusive. The waitress was knowledgeable and made good recommendations. They have an extensive Margarita menu and the one I had was fantastic.\n\nWe added pictures of the food we ordered and I made everyone wait to eat so that I could take some good pictures so make sure to check them out.\n \nWe will be definitely coming back here to try their other dishes."
0,"So I go shopping one day at my local walmart in el mirage, do all my shopping with my kiddos and come outside, I get to my suv and realize that there is a HUGE dent in the back and I mean HUGE! so I was like what the F man and run back inside to tell them,waiting,waiting,waiting, finally I get to talk to someone and they tell me there is nothing the store can do so he says go talk to the security officer that drives around the parking lot so I do that meanwhile im still running around with my kids and a cart full of groceries,so i find this guy and he pretty much looks at my car and said there is nothing we can do about this......really dude? you cant call the cops?,you cant look at the video to see if you can Id the car that hit mine? you cant do anything? what are the cameras for? just in case someone hits something of yours? who gives a poo about the customers! I will never go back here again."

0,"You get what you pay for.  Took my first and last trip on Spirit.  Flew from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale and back.  The plane was a dog.  My window seat looked like it was cleaned with mop water.  Garbage in my seat pocket.  A seat that wouldn't recline.  Dirty head rests.  A 4.5 hour flight and i'm not even offered water?  Maybe that's a good thing since only one of the two lavatories was working.  Spirit did get me there on time, but I ran for a shower immediately."
1,"After seeing peter's review and the offer for the hot chicks i stopped in for lunch and got four of these bad boys for the office. They are amazingly good and simple all at once. and for the price of 1.50 each I was super happy.  Its in a hotdog bun with lettuces and onions, a nice long piece of fried chicken and a couple slices of tomatoes covered in a sauce of your choice. A much better alternative to the hotdog. Amazingly tasty and kind of freaky that its so tasty :)"
0,"This hotel and Casino really sucks! I was at the slots and every employee that would pass by i would ask for the waitress, because I wanted to order a drink...  Well i spent $80 on the 1 cent slot and never saw a waitress..! I waited for 2 hrs! I guess at this hotel customer service is not an important factor!  Never coming back here AGAIN!!"
1,"I dont go here for the pharmacy...I go here for the sales! \n\nGrowing up I thought that everything cost more at stores of convenience, but I was wrong. So wrong. Their milk and toilet paper are on sale every other week, they always have tons of stuff on clearance, and for a smoker like me, you cant beat their prices.\n\nI also love all the women who work here. It's like small town service."
0,"Oh, please. Might be a good place for drinks, but it was a bust for brunch. When you occupy an historic building you might think you go for a look that's either charming or edgy, and Bar Marco is neither. Tables are small, chairs not all that comfortable, the servers lean toward pretense and away from professionalism -- flatware but no napkins? Who does that? My friend asked for decaf and got a \""no\"" dripping with sarcasm, as if to say, \""we don't treat our beans that way.\"" On to the food: the Bloody Mary was good, if skimpy. A dish billed as fried chicken with dandelion greens, topped with a fried egg -- yeah, screw heart disease -- consisted of two overly crusted and overly fried thighs completely concealing a half-dozen threads of wilted-to-death greens. When you have guest chefs, you can't hang crap food on the kitchen because they can simply blame the guest. I know this approach is trendy but it's a bad idea because the secret of every solid restaurant is consistency, Cute idea, though, cute location, cute clientele, but if I want to eat cute, I'll trim my Chia Pet and skip Bar Marco."
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I are relatively new to the area and wanted to try a local place. We are not very familiar with Vietnamese food, but after reading multiple good reviews, we decided to try Saigon Kitchen. We were not disappointed!\n\nIt appears the place typically serves takeout, but we were greeted warmly and invited to stay. The woman helping us asked if we were familiar with Vietnamese food, and when we told her 'no,' proceeded to walk us through the menu and answer questions. \n\nWe settled on a mixture of some of their most popular dishes, including spring rolls, bahm mi, pho, and an egg noodle stir-fry. It was a ton of food and it was all delicious! Out total bill was $26, and we had food left over to take home!\n\nAs somebody that is not an expert in Vietnamese food, I can't really compare it to others, but I will tell you that this place will now be a regular spot for my fianc\u00e9 and I. Very enjoyable, nicely priced, and highly recommended!"
0,"Forgive me if this seems a little harsh. But I really did not have a good experience with Concentra.  \nWith a workman's comp injury and having to have several appointments , I found that the majority of their doctors are just there to work 8 hours and then there are a few who actually care about their patients. \nIt is great to be able to make an appt at any time of the day. HOWEVER if you make an appointment they should have doctors see you around that appointment time. EVEN with an appointment I spent at least 2 -3 hours in the waiting room .\nFRUSTRATING!\nSome of the front office staff is rude.  Getting a call back on referrals is extremely difficult.  I had a broken bone and was told to take advil.  \nNot my idea of care."
1,To day I had soem free time after droping the kid off at the sitter and before I went to work. So I stoped by the mall to get a pretezel.

0,"I ate here a total of 3 times, take out twice, and dining in once. If I was basing this solely on the take out experience, it would have been 4-5 stars. The food is great, huge portions, and they are open 24 hours. The food also came out pretty quickly, even at 3 AM. However, on our last day we ate there for lunch with 8 people. We were seated immediately, even though only 4of us were there. The other 4 arrived less than 5 minutes later. We asked for 8 waters, and received a total of 5. We then had to wait 30 minutes for a server to come to us. I had to stand up and walk to the hostess and ask her to send a server to our table. He got us the remaining waters and then we had to wait another 20 minutes before we even placed our order. The table of 6 next to us arrived after, ate, and paid before we even got our food. I complained to the manager, who then sent the waiter over again. The manager told the waiter we complained, in our presence. The waiter came over and instead of apologizing, argued with us that he had come over shortly after our whole party had arrived. We were all taken aback that not only did the manager tell the waiter of our complaint in front of us while we were eating but also that the waiter tried to argue with us that he was right. At the end, it took us an hour and a half to eat here, and nothing was comped from the bill. Eating in is a disaster, I would give it one star based solely on that experience. I would recommend taking out from here."
1,"Ya another chain, I know but get over it!\n\nThis location is almost never busy.  It's tucked away next to Sauce and on the other side of The Living Room.  I am always greeted with a friendly hello and served promptly.  This location is super clean too.  I cannot stand it when the soda station is sticky and messy but not here....they keep it very clean and organized.  \n\nThey don't have as many items on their menu but what they have they do very well.  The bread is always fresh and the veggies are crisp.  I'm guessing they do a good business at lunchtime due to the other businesses around them.  I've been in on off hours and I'm usually the only one there or there is one other person.  Overall this is a great location!"
0,"All I can say is their food is just MeH.. I had bowtie pasta with pesto and garlic. 1 star because I like pesto. Other than that, nothing too special."
0,"I'll start by saying we didn't eat here, we just wanted refreshments on a hot day!  The place is cute, clean and I would've thought about going back to have something to eat if ever in the area.  \n\nBut, their service is horrible - absolutely rude and condescending.  If you are able to make out what they are saying . . . I don't speak Chinese so perhaps that's on me, but I didn't realize that's what it took.  There were two females at the counter when we walked up and one just looked at us (yes, we were clothed, yes, we were clean, and yes, we smiled when we walked in) and the other said, \""what u like?\""  Whoa, wait a minute!  The bartender kept looking at me, but never smiled and never offered to help, much less mutter a \""hello\"".  Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! \n\nI had a Green Tea Boba Tea and my daughters and their friend had strawberry and passion fruit snow ice, that also was tasty and they said it was yummy.  I am pretty sure fresh fruit is used as the mango snow ice is deemed 'seasonal' and it wasn't available as that is typically a summer fruit.  My tea was good, but not enough to bring me back to bad service.  There's no excuse, there are many other tea houses in the area.  Call me spoiled . . ."
1,"Totally enjoyed my birthday dinner at Inca's on Thursday. Fatima was charming and our waiter was very attentive, even if he moved like the Energizer bunny! Food was delicious - the PISCO PORTON (very yummy!), the CEVICHE MIXTO and the Shrimp bisque soup (CHUPO DE CAMRONES) were all perfect. So were all the other dinners. Have to go back. Prices no worse than other moderate-upscale places in the area. Nice change of pace! Hope they stick around. Nice atmosphere too."
1,Dive bar at its best. Fun electro/dubstep beats. Yucky bathrooms. Cool kids. Weird people and starving hipsters. Amazing times! \n\nYou can find me by the bar twice a week.
1,"Fun Fun Fun!!!!! This is my new favorite casino in Vegas. There is a great upbeat feel when you walk in the casino. They have top 40 hip hop, pop music playing at all times and plenty of eye candy for the fellas top look at. Their deli was my favorite that I've had in Vegas. The Earl Of Sandwich, all of there sandwiches are 5.99 wraps 5.99 soup 3.99. I had the caperse sandwich it was a refreshing feeling with every bite on perfectly toast bread it was seriously heavenly. I also had the BLT sandwich also excellent,and the  tomato soup was great. Poker room was in the middle of the casino which is kinda different, its definitely a nice room that has lots of traffic going through it but not overbearing."
1,"review for 1 bedroom suite (non-smoking)\n\nTHE +'s: oh, like maybe, EVERYTHING. impeccable service. amazing mod decor with dark wood and chrome accents. the 1-bedroom suite was amazing -- had 2 full baths and a fully equipped kitchen (not kitchenette!). private bedroom had huge comfortable bed, tv that rose out of the desk, and the master bath fit 5 women bustling around getting ready for the night out. main living area had an armoire so huge there were coat closets on each side. also, starbucks was downstairs. oh heaven.\n\nTHE -'s: the great thing was that the signature is isolated from the main casino. but that can be the bad part too since it takes a while to get from the signature to the conveniences of the main casino. still, the isolation means none of the stench of smoking and dirty money infiltrates your stay. the view wasn't much to write home about since it faces as yet un-developed lots.\n\nSUM: love, love, love the signature. recommend it to anyone who's willing to dish out the cash. it's totally worth it. share the cost with 10 of your closest friends -- there's enough room to sleep everyone."

0,"The pearls in the bubble tea weren't made right. For some reason, they weren't serving sushi (it was 3pm so I don't know if there was a time limit). So I ordered the Thai red curry. It was served in a huge bowl with a small bowl of rice. A few chunks of chicken and some vegetables."
0,"My Wife made reservations for us at Palazzo for my Birthday. We had read that Lavo was great for the Sunday Brunch so we decided to start the day with the Brunch. Lavo opened at 10:00AM and we arrived a few minutes before opening. When we arrived there were already people in the waiting area therefore we figured that it would be best to check in with the hostess in case they get busy. \nUpon greeting the hostess we were given a strange look like what are you doing here and then she said can I help you. We told her we were there for the Brunch at which time she said they were not open and we could wait. Remember, we were three minutes early. We walked around until we noticed a couch near the dining area and we decided to wait here. After 20 minutes of waiting and watching an unorganized staff the hostess came to us and asked if we were waiting for a table. We told her once again that we were waiting for a table and she then proceeded to a table in the dining room for us to have a seat. We asked if the terrace was available as we had read that the terrace was nice. She did not know and had to ask a server who told her yes. The hostess then directed us to the terrace where we were seated and provided menus. \nAfter another 15 minutes of not being helped or even acknowledged we got up and walked out. As we left all of the wait staff was in the area and not one of the staff asked us if we needed anything. as we walked past the hostess station there was another employee there that appeared to have some level of authority as they were in business attire. As we were leaving I said to her that we were leaving after 30 minutes of waiting and there was not response. We left and went to Mario Batli's Enoteco Otto where we had a wonderful experience."
0,"Alright, I know this place is a local legend. I want to give it a higher rating, I really do. But Eddie's place was a big \""meh\"" in my book.\n\nFirst of all, it's trying to accomplish wayyyyy to much. Is it a southern comfort place? A breakfast place? Eclectic American? Bar food? Deli? And why the shit are there potstickers on the menu?\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the shrimp and cheese grits, which were very good. Possibly the mildest grits I'd ever had. It came with a salad that was substantial and included bacon. So far, so good. Some friends ordered the she-crab soup, which was tasty, especially with a bit of sherry.\n\nHowever, a friend ordered the potato skins, which were completely lacking for flavor. Couldn't taste cheese, potato, or even sour cream. Just grease and carbs. Another friend ordered the reuben. It did not look good: greasy, with far too little meat.\n\nThe service was friendly, but bumbling. First, the potato skins came out as potstickers. Strike one. Then they added $1.50 to my tab because I asked for spinach in my salad. Seriously? First of all, spinach is not that fucking expensive. And secondly, you couldn't even put that in the fucking menu? Or explain to me that it cost extra? I call bullshit. Bullshit x1000.\n\nPrices were high for the food they were serving. Needed to be about 20% less.\n\nThe place loaded up with people as we finished our meal, so we got out of there quickly to make way for the next party. I wanted to shake some of them on the way out and shout, \""Why are you wasting your money here?! Go someplace where you can get consistent food with competent waitstaff!\""\n\nSo, I dunno. Not my cup of tea. Maybe if you can stand dumb servers and you can distinguish between what is good and what isn't on the menu, you'll have a better time."
1,"This place is great for ambiance food and service. The adovada is hot but wonderful and the chocolate bread pudding is amazing. Its a dark cave on the inside and waterfalls on the outside... wonderful for a date or a family gathering. Just make sure you like food a little spicy :). Would have been full 5 stars, but the price is a hair high for what you get. However, the place is always busy, so I guess it may be priced right for the area...."
0,"The two stars are for Vinnie - he's pretty funny! Most of the jokes I have heard before.. but it was still a good time and kudos to him for working seven nights a week. The reason why I couldn't give any more stars is because I felt like the \""free\"" tickets we received was a total ripoff. Basically we got two free tickets but they have a $16.99 one drink minimum per person. It took the waitress 40 minutes to take our drink order in a small room, and the show was only about an hour or an hour and a half. I found myself searching for the waitress the whole first half to \""make sure I got my monies worth\"" instead of relaxing and enjoying the show. $16.99 is pretty steep, especially since you only get one, and you can only choose from beer, wine, or well. You get those for free when you sit down in the casino! I tried to order a seven and seven (which is well in other bars) but they said no. We both ended up getting a vodka cranberry and it came in a tiny glass full of ice and bright red (i.e. no booze). So sad. AND they don't let you bring in your drinks even though you already pre-paid for one. I really could have used my wine they made me throw away outside :/.\n\nSummary: LOVED Vinnie, strongly disliked the service. In the end it really felt like we got screwed with the \""free\"" tickets and joke of a drink. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this show. Maybe buy one of his dvds instead and watch it in your room with a bottle of wine!"
1,"Fast, reliable, incredibly helpful and friendly. They helped us out in a bind and provided the best service you could ask for with a smile!  Very professional and I highly recommend them.  We will be using them again!"
0,"This is another store from which we have to move our dollars away from.      We often use them for clothing and some housewares.   They are also conveniently located by other businesses that we frequently shop at.  Sadly, they have chosen to open their stores early this Thanksgiving destroying any chance for their employees to enjoy the holiday.  As a result we will be taking our dollars elsewhere.    Any store that opens prior to 5am on friday morning after Thanksgiving will lose our business."
1,"This is a good place to eat Thai.  The staff is great and the food is pretty good.  I love their sticky rice.  Be careful the cook makes everything pretty hot, even if you ask them to make it mild (that why only 4 stars) other wise everything we have tried is great."
0,"I used to meet clients at La Bistrote on a regular basis. The owner was very rude on numerous occasions - making us switch tables to accommodate larger parties when the place was completely empty and most notably for berating my clients for not ordering something during a 5 min meeting. It was absolutely embarrassing! We were planning to come back for lunch a few mins later but after this encounter, I will never go back to La Bistrote again. If you don't care about being decent to your customers, don't open a restaurant."
1,"Wow,I placed an order here last night and the pizza was to my door in 15 minutes!  I got a pepperoni pizza with a chocolate chip cookie and the cookie's are to die for. Also if you order online there are a lot of good deals going on."
0,"This pains me to write this review and I am giving 2 stars out of fairness and previously solid history with LGO as I live a few blocks away.  I have been there hundreds of times previously.  I have had many wonderful experiences previously and have referred dozens of friends to LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen, Postino, etc.  \n\nSo, it's this past Sunday morning and I run in real quick for a few breakfast items, those being English muffins and a regular iced mocha latte.  The place was packed as usual but seemed more so because of far too much merchandise and no where for people to wait or even stand.  The service was friendly.  In case you haven't tried the English muffins, they come in a 5 pack and they are very tasty-a must have and great toasted.  \n\nMy heart burn on this visit begins at the register.  Two two items together totaled $18.02.  I was shocked so I asked the girl at the coffee bar register if she rang it in right and she assured me she did. She was very nice about it but OMG WTF?  I paid and came home.  The mocha was way too sweet and not even comparable to Starbuck's(which I do not like for the record).  So, essentially, I paid $18.02 for a pack of English muffins.  Ridiculous!  Will I go back?  Most assuredly I will but it will be a bit before I do."
1,Our favorite fast food place. They have the best service and good fast food.
1,"Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far..."
0,"relaxing, very good location.  little cramped with small tables"
0,"Scandalous. Located in a horrible part of town. Absolutely disgusting rooms. I had to duct tape the curtains to the wall for privacy. The mattress was like a board. The bathtub faucet fell into the tub when I turned the water on. They gouged us $60 even though the sign out front said $40, but we were desperate. I sincerely hope this place burns to the ground."
0,This review only indicates the lack of customer service associated w/ a recent dinner we were suppose to have. Reservations were made to celebrate my bday & I called 3hrs prior to confirm the reservation. The hostess confirmed the reservation but about an hr before our reservation I received a vm that the restaurant was closed for dinner & they could not accommodate our party. I called them back & the hostess confirmed that they had a special event & only the bar would be open tonight for chips & cocktails. Really??? Why accept our reservation & then confirm it the day of. Not a successful way to run a business :( Not a good start to my bday evening!
0,"Ugh!  I thought maybe I should try this place again before I slam it on Yelp, but after reading some of the other one- and two-star reviews, I realize I'm not nuts.  And there is no way I'm going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt's is the place for you.  Disgusting!  Not to mention the bathroom is next door in a hotel room."
0,"As a 'person' goes , Garick Ho is probably the worst type of individual you could possibly meet. Very dishonest and misrepresents himself as a professional. Purchases used items off websites to use at Practice....sterilized...yeah right! Consider yourself warned."
1,man love the food here ..everything here is excellent always get pan roast or gumbo tried something different this time went with creole superb usually get a level 7 on spicey... this time Tip hooked me up with a 9 ...took sometime to get it down but was simply sensational... love couple places in town this is definite top three places and dishes for me in valley.
1,"I can't say enough good things about the labor and delivery and nicu at St Rose - San Martin. My wife was 36 weeks pregnant and having back pain and some contractions on and off. We weren't feeling the baby as much as usual so we went in. The triage nurse hooked us up and started monitoring. We were still not getting much movement so they ordered for an iv to maybe wake him up. After a few minutes they came back in with full staff letting us know they needed to get our son out. He would have a much better chance outside then in. Within 10 minutes she was on the table and I was in the OR with her. A minute later my son was born. They rushed him to the nicu where staff there gave him a blood transfusion and intubated him. A week later, he's doing much better now. \n\nAs for the staff, they were all such wonderful people. From triage, to Dr Chambers who delivered him, to the anesthesiologist and everyone who took care of my wife and son. I'm so beyond thankful we went to this hospital. It may be a bit smaller, but because of that, I felt we had so much more attention. Everyone was very concerned for my wife and child. Even when nurses were off the clock, they'd still be checking in with the nurses in nicu on how our son was doing. \n\nSo once again, THANK YOU to everyone at San Martin.  If you're looking for a place to deliver your baby, definitely take a tour of this great facility. I don't know what we would've done without these great people. My review doesn't do this place justice."
0,"No.  Just, no.\n\nI went here because I had a coupon for pizza (they confusingly operate a pizza joint that is really the same place but for some reason they call it Snaggle's Pizza and pretend it's different but they don't but they do but - hell, don't ask), and I was anything but impressed.\n\nI showed up right at the time they promised my pizza and ended up sitting around for over twenty minutes.  Because I had prepaid (it was on Groupon), I figured I'd better wait around to get what I paid for.  While sitting there I was treated to a pretty mundane bar experience with little in the way of atmosphere, though plenty in the way of grungy.\n\nAnyway, this review is about the separate but not really separate but separate but, well, never mind that.  This is about their pizza.  The pizza finally came after twenty minutes of waiting passed their promised time, and when I got it, it was probably the worst pizza I've ever had: including frozen pizza.  The crust was super thin, which isn't bad on its own, but it also had zero flavor (it tasted frozen and waterlogged) and was either overcooked in some areas or soggy in others.  There was virtually no sauce on the pizza, which made choking down the crust especially difficult.  As far as the toppings go, they tasted stale and previously frozen right out of the box, which would have been a bigger deal had there actually been detectable quantities of toppings on the slices.  Seriously, I could make out maybe one or two pieces of topping per slice on an extra large pizza.  Pathetic.\n\nI don't feel particularly ripped off because I got this on a $1 lunch Groupon deal, but if I had the opportunity in the future, I wouldn't even drop 100 pennies on this pizza.  When you consider their regular prices (WHICH ARE FREAKING OUTRAGEOUS), this place is a complete bust."
0,"This is not your typical Embassy Suites.  It is an older property that was converted to an Embassy.  The bathrooms were in the bedroom, rather then the hall.  That turned out to be the problem.  We had plumbing problem with the commode.  Every twenty minutes it would make a giant sucking noise and the water would drain from the bowl.  Kind of funny, except when you are trying to sleep and it would wake us constantly.  For two days the front desk and maintenence would just shine us on.  Then they tried to fix but never did.  Long story short we got little sleep during the four night stay.  Front desk said they could not move us because they were full.  They never offerred a reduction in our room rate.  Then their were the smokers....everywhere.  People smoked around the pool and spa despite kids playing.  They would smoke outside our room and our non smoking room would smell.  The surrounding neighborhood was kind of scary, don't plan on long walks if you stay here.  On a positive note the employees working in happy hour, restaurant and breakfast were very nice, which was the only reason I gave the hotel two stars.  In short the facility is called Embassy Suites but is not what you would be used to if you stayed at other Embassy locations.  I should also mention that since our March stay was peak season the rates were expensive, which just added to our misery."
0,"I've got mixed feeling about this restaurant---I was taken there this past Sunday evening as a birthday treat by my son and husband. Got there around 6:00pm and although the place had empty tables we had to wait to be seated. My son has eaten here before and raves over the food so we thought an excellent choice for dinner. Now, the first reviewer on Yelp really raves over the service and warm staff, but I found neither to be true. They barely acknowledged us ---the chips were terribly stale and salsa bland. \n   Now , we placed our orders and we waited 45 minutes for the food to come---I had asked our server if something was wrong as it was 7:00pm and still no food. She said one of their cooks was not there that night and they were a bit behind. No dear, you were way behind ---when the food came out all the rice and bean sides were stone cold but the entrees were at least hot. We informed her of this and they brought out all  new (and hot) rice and bean. At no time did the server ask to refill my husband's ice tea ---that is just poor service. I do think the food is very good and high quality but the service and professionalism is sorely lacking. There have been at least four different restaurants located at this site--maybe some of you remember Glorious Cuisine from the late 80's , then Rao's and another Mexican place which did not make it. I would at least try the place one more time just to see if the service gets any better because the food is well prepared and good---just indifferent on the service."
1,Eaten here twice and the food and service are consistently good. Their seafood salad is fantastic. The portions are filling unlike other restaurants in the area where you have to order 4 dishes to feel like you got a decent meal. They use the freshest ingredients and the soups are amazing. I will definitely be back to sample their dessert sampler.
0,"Worst customer service I have ever received. I rented a beat up UHAUL truck from them, and when I returned it they accused me of \""backing into a tree.\"" Nick, the immature hothead that I was dealing with, never bothered to walk me outside and show me the damage in question. Just throws accusations at me without even asking me about it. I then wait at the counter for about 30 minutes (after I had spent the past 6 hours MOVING) for him to type some numbers on his computer. He basically ignores everything that I'm saying to him and stares at his computer. When he does reply to my questions or comments, he was rude and extremely unprofessional. After all this,  he casually gives me a bill for over $360 in damages. I immediately ask to speak with the manager, Dale, who did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. He said that I would have to \""take it up with UHAUL.\"" He doesn't bother to ask me my side of the story or how he can help. Thankfully another employee was able to confirm that the scratch that they were trying to get me to pay $360 for was damage caused by a previous customer. It took over an hour to resolve all of this.You really shouldn't offer UHAUL rental if you are unwilling to deal with the problems that occur from your own incompetence, Dale. They also haven't responded to any of my emails asking for some sort of consolation and/or explanation. I guess they really don't care about their honest customers and their concerns. Pretty sad, considering that they're labeled as a \""family owned business.\"" My family and I will take our business elsewhere. And Nick, I pray to the heavens above that you find some inner peace and stop taking your frustrations out on honest, hard-working people. God Bless."
0,"They destroy my drink 8/10 times and their baristas are quite rude. For one of the busiest Starbucks in Scottsdale, they lack quite a bit. I stopped coming to this Starbucks. I now go to the other one inside the store off the freeway."
0,"Parking is narrow, as another yelper previously wrote. The raisin French Toast was awesome according to\nMy daughter. My omelette consisted of burnt eggs. The coffee was warm, not hot. My husband gets the breakfast sandwich with ham, always, and the ham was like lunch meat, not the thick ham served at the Carnegie location. The inside is nice and new, but the food is much less to be desired. We will be going back to the Carnegie location from now on."
1,"Biagio is about as good as it gets for your typical inexpensive nail salon.  It's nice, modern and clean inside.  It looks like it's been recently remodeled and the management takes pride in the overall appearance.  This is often rare for a nail salon. The staff is very friendly!  I always think this is a big deal with nail salons.  You don't want to awkwardly sit there in silence while someone does your nails.  \n\nThey have a very impressive selection of gel manicure colors!  Probably the largest selection I've seen at a nail salon in this area.  The pedicures are great and they come with a free mini shoulder massage!  Always a nice perk! \n\n If you're in the area - great place to check out for a cheap mani/pedi.  If you're not in the area- maybe not worth more than a 10 min drive out of your way."
1,Amazing....the kouign-amann is so amazing...Must taste to appreciate.
1,"This place is so nice. I always have fun in this little shop. They have a great selection on baby gear. Its nice to shop someplace else other than Walmart or Babies R Us.\nIf your expecting or know someone who is this is a great place to check out, you will be glad you did."
1,"I have driven by this unassuming place many times and always wondered how the food was. My daughter and I had lunch here today and shared an order of crab wontons, cashew chicken, beef ribs and beef with yellow curry.  Everything was really good and there was plenty left over to take home.  We got the spiciest option for the curry and it was delicious.  We will definitely go back and try some other things next time.  The noodle dishes looked very good."
1,Love love love firefly....bacon wrapped dates...has been amazing food everytime i have been there.... The service was ok...will definately go back...always great for a party!!!
1,"I don't get why so many people here say it's a bad place. Personally I think this is one of the best Chinese sit down restaurant walking distance from U Waterloo. The menu has many choices, taste is decent, and the dishes are fairly priced."
1,This place has some wonderful tasting Olive Oils.  I love that they do tastings while you are in the store too.  The bottle are a bit pricey tho for what you actually get.  Makes good gifts.
1,"60 beers on tap. Sixty. Six-zero. I'm not even the biggest beer drinker, but hot damn that selection makes me feel like I need one every time I come here.\n\nI will look over the menu and try to force myself to order something else, but I just can''t stray away from the Phillys. They are so ridiculously yummy here. My go to: buffalo chicken Philly... add banana peppers. Sometimes I get it with Cheese Whiz. I know, I know... I'm awful. \n\nWhen I do have some self control here, I go with the salmon salad and ask for the fish to be cooked in one of the wing sauces. I like terriyaki-hot. I enjoy going here with a group in hopes that I can steal a wing or piece of pizza from someone. Lay off me, I'm starving.\n\nThis location has drink specials every day. Tuesdays and Thursdays all the drafts are $3.50. Gah, is it pumpkin beer season yet?!\n\nOne big downfall: the parking situation is awful. That's the problem for this entire Montford area. \n\nI was bummed to move away from this hood and being just a couple blocks away from here. However, I am super excited about their new location set to open Uptown in the old Fox and Hound. Staff tell me to expect that to open around January."
0,"The positive reviews are shocking to me! This was not at all our experience.\nHere are the facts:\n-The metal handrails, all over the park, heat up so fast in the Vegas sun it will burn your hand; watch out for this if you have smaller children\n-The staff is a group of unorganized teenagers with no clue or concern about customer service. They aren't trained well and it was difficult to even find someone who was actually 'in charge' to help with problems\n-The lines are RIDICULOUS!!!! If you don't pay for the speed pass to hold your place in line for a ride, you have to stand-uncovered in the Vegas sun-to wait for a raft, then climb up the tower to again wait in line to actually go down the slide. Be prepared bc this adds another $35+ to your general admission ticket\n-The rental rafts are a waste of money. They can only be used on 2 'rides' & none of the slides. Plus people just abandon them throughout the day so just pick up one of those when you want to float on one. \n-The food is overpriced and gross, the sunscreen is outrageous, but I realize those prices are par for the course at any amusement park. \n-Parking is a nightmare. Be prepared to walk...far\n\nMaybe in a couple more years they will have some of the kinks worked out but it's nothing but an expensive hassle.  Save your time & sanity as a local & just take your kids to the Rio pool for free."
0,"I am a Vegas veteran been there four times this year alone. I was pretty happy when I seen how cheap this hotel was for 5 days so we decided to give it a try. Worst mistake ever! We booked a smoking room and ended up on the first floor with no view. It reminded me of a prison because as soon as you opened the curtains all we seen was a brick wall no view what so ever. Then, every time we came back to the hotel in the early morning hours we would literally be harassed by security to show them our room keys. The staff is rude and their are always people bothering you about show tickets and other bs crap. The decor is old and ugly in the hallways and the rooms. Also good luck trying to find an ice machine anywhere!!! I would never stay there again even if it was free. Spend a little extra money and go stay somewhere better."
1,Great Italian food....They messed up my pizza order but went above and beyond brought out a different pizza for appetizer and a beer on the house! Great restaurant and great service but the best thing is the food fresh ingredients and good Italian great atmosphere.
0,"I found a bug in the raspberry in the Mochi ice cream. The waitress was very impatient, every time we needed to order something she would run off to get it but wasn't finish ordering.  She talked too fast that was hard to understand her.  The furniture was cheap and not comfortable.  other food was okay. The manager took some items off the bill though."
1,THE BEST PIZZA ANYWHERE !!! The owners are incredibly nice and put a lot of effort and pride in their business.
1,Mark was great! In and out of the office way quick. No pain. Totally recommend him to everyone I know.
1,"If you get nothing else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. \n\nI just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.\n\nThey were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend's and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own! \n\nAs we rolled out of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!"
0,"I was not impressed with the employees lack of knowledge on their batter repair services, and simple desire to sell me overpriced batteries that I can purchase on Amazon for 30% less or more."
1,"Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, who knows, I am not the management :-)"
1,Very cool ambiance and probably one of the better places in Phoenix. Beef stew was okay (tasty but hard to differentiate from other stews). Prawn appetizer was awesome. Service is sweet
0,"I think you would have to be a huge Beatles fan to enjoy this Cirque show. I've been to a few Cirque shows (Ka, O, Iris, Zumanity, Elvis) and The Beatles LOVE left a lot to be desired. I was hoping it would be similar to the Elvis show where the audience would learn about the life of the artists and take something away after the show. LOVE was basically the Beatles' music playing over the sound system while people in decade costumes danced around. This show lacked the usual breath taking acrobatics and did not have a WOW factor. I saw a lot of eyelids in the audience as they were dreaming of a better place to be."
1,Big ass burgers. Damn good fast food. It's still a fast food joint so dont expect the most amazing tasting or healthy type food but its still good. Service wasn't amazing but i have no complaints about it. enjoy
0,Worst Customer Service and follow-up appointment.  I traveled from North side of town to view Design Center.  Location was not the best but I thought it would be good once inside.  Man was sitting at desk and never bothered to greet.  Sales Person came over and I made appointment for one of Team Members to come to residence and get ideas and work quoted.  It NEVER HAPPENED.  So Disappointed that they did not even call me back to say they were too busy.  Glad this happened as I cant imagine if they actually got awarded for contract work; their follow-up would be horrible.  BUYER BEWARE!  Customer Service and Follow-up is what gets your business relayed to friends.
1,"I can not say enough good things about Border Grill. It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. My most recent visit was due to them updating their brunch menu. The weekend brunch is a fantastic deals at $30 for all you can eat tapas (add on all you can drink mimosas for $5). There are items on the menu to appeal to every taste from 'traditional' breakfast to people who want something more like lunch. If you're a pancakes person, definitely try the mexican chocolate chip pancakes or the bread pudding french toast. The chorizo sausage biscuit and gravy is great, so are the chilaquiles and the shrimp and grits. I love their short ribs, so I was super excited to have the short rib hash. My roommate loved the frittata (also new to the menu) and he normally hates eggs. I love the green corn tamales, but those are on the regular dinner menu too. Be sure to ask them to bring out the guava empanadas.\n\nMy only criticism is that I want to order everything and I end up completely stuffed. The service is always excellent - the staff and management both makes a point of getting to know their regulars. I always mock the people in the restaurant on the weekends with the lunch menu. Spend the same amount and get a huge variety of amazing food. It's Mexican twists on American dishes and some interesting interpretations of classic Mexican food as well."
0,"We went to the new one on tropical. I can say that we had never eaten at a Farmer Boy Restaurant, so we were excited to try it out. The star was for fast polite service but not for the food. We ordered two barn burner combos. I had the split side zucchini and onion rings and my husband had fries and had his burger no onions. Being they recently opened it was packed. \nThe placement of the soda machine was awkward where only one person could get drinks and hurry to find the lids with no where to place your drinks down. When we finally found a seat our order was brought to us. My sides were not right, so we told them and they brought me the onion rings. Then my husbands burger didn't have the jalepenos that should be in the burger and had LOTS of onions! We decided share my jalepenos and scrape the onions off because by this time we were starving. Well after 4 bites my burger was pink and cold and seemed like I was eating a salad. I went to try my onion rings and they had no taste what so ever. By this time we had had enough of the loud conversations where I could barely hear my husband ask me for the ketchup. We left needless to say that my husband didn't finish his meal either. It was a disappointment."
0,The worst customer service I have experienced in a long time! Go down the street to Starbucks. I won't make this mistake again.
1,"1 *  Great atmosphere \n1 * Friendly Staff\n3 *** Best Coffee in Downtown Phoenix or maybe in all Phoenix.\nMy coffee always taste the same. ( Very good ) and they always make a cute latte art.\nThe only bad thing is their parking, sometimes i don't find where to park and i have to go another coffee, but i think they are relocating soon. \nGo try this place!!"
0,"I probably won't return. I've been noticing these chains popping up all over the Dane County area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while I was in Sun Prairie.\n\nWhat I like is that as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by someone who helped you with the process if you're a first timer. This is very different from other sandwich places. You go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags. So if you want a turkey sandwich, you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have. They do the same for beef, tuna, veggie, chicken, etc. You grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag, you mark with a provided sharpie all of the toppings you want. This is a really neat idea. I liked the selection process. When you've marked your bag with all of your toppings, which they do provided a lot of choices I must admit, you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist. They put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections. Again, very cool idea. When're sandwich is done, they call you by name. There is a place on the bag for you to put your name down. \n\n\nHowever, they are overpriced for their quality of food. You get to pick from three different bread sizes, 6, 10.5 and 14 inches. For a 10.5 inch, it's $8.25 if you don't add toppings that are priced extra.   The sandwich was just OK. Nothing special. They gave me the wrong mustard but it wasn't a huge deal. My biggest issue is that there isn't any combo special. At least that is not what was told to me. For a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips, it was over $10. Had I added a pop, I would have been close to $12. It's a lot of money for a sandwich that's very basic and some chips. If the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made, I totally could see the justification of price. However, the sandwich was just basic.  I prefer Quiznos or Pot Bellys over Which Wich to be honest. I had a lot of toppings on mines, but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish. I couldn't even taste the other toppings. \n\nDoubtful i'd return. They aren't  terribly bad but they are far from greatness. The experience of picking your sandwich is cool but that's really the only positive I have from my first time experience. I can at least day I tried it and seen what they had to offer. Now I know and I won't be returning. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere."
1,"Its times like this im glad im a yelper. One star for this establishment is far from fair. Im sure the person who wrote the other review had her reasons, but keep in mind its a brand new facility & theyre still working out bugs. \n\nI for one am very glad to have another indoor jump house place to add to my familys repetoir. \n\nWe came here for a party & were greeted by the owner, roger, who was polite & friendly. \n\nOverall it was a positive experience. My kids loved it, i found out their open bounce is ALL DAY and only $8 a kid (a buck cheaper than the place nearest me, so id spend a little extra gas to come here), and their parties are cheaper than bounce u. \n\nCompared to bounce u, this place is smaller but cleaner & safer BY FAR (see myreview on bounce u in henderson, my daughters foot got caught in a hanging rope that shouldnt have beenthere & she was suspended by her leg, and no one was even there to supervise. Havent been back since.)\n\nMy only comments to the owner are to help make a new place a bit better:\n\nThe matts WERE loose. I stepped on one & it came apart under my foot. May want to think about gluing them in place. If not to the floor, at least to each other. \n\nAlso if you pay for a party, you really shpuld have more than an hour and a half in the facility, and you probably shpuld have help to serve food, cake, etc. i didnt know my hostess very well but i wound up helping her serve cake because she didnt have help. If youre only going to have 1.5 hour parties, having a helper to serve will speed up the party process for sure. \n\nOne final thought. This place is difficult to find. A sign by the street would be helpful. \n\nAs i said, overall a positive experience. \n\n4 stars."
1,I saw Zumanity a little over a year ago when I was in Vegas for my 21st birthday. This was the first Cirque show that I have ever seen and I was blown away. This show was sexy and fun. The actors are also extremely talented. The acrobats were my favorite. If you're in Vegas and want to see a talent filled show then definitely go see Zumanity. And be sure to get there about 30 minutes early. The interaction with the audience before the show is hilariously terrific!
1,"Enjoy going here and have always had friendly service though it can be a little slow. Understandable occasionally, not consistently though."
1,I love this place! The Arizona burger is perfect! This is the burger joint that I bring my family and friends from out of town! I love the convenience of the location as well! Very yummy food! The smash fries are the best and a must order when you go! Once in a while I will treat myself to a shake but sometimes it is hard to resist! Also it is right across from the Camden #apartments that I live at so it is a great go to for a Burger night or quick lunch!Thumbs up Smashburger! #scottsdaleaz #scottsdalelife #camdenliving #camdenlegacy
0,"If you're looking for some Vietnamese cuisine near Chandler Blvd & Rural Rd, take your first immediately available u-turn and head to Pho Dalat.  My review is based on Sage being a restaurant\n\nSage had so much potential.  Its located near Cafe Krishna on the southeast corner of Rural and Chandler.  A perfect location to get the Intel crowd for lunch.  Sage is housed in what used to be a few failed bars, but it has been completely remodeled.  There are garage doors ala Postino style that open out to the front.  The patio has been expanded with more contemporary furniture, but my compliments stop there.\n\nWalking in, there's a dart machine, golden tee, and jukebox to the right.  In the middle of the restaurant is a pool table.  There's large rectangular hightops and a few low tops.  A weird mix?  Wait until you look over and see a couch meant for a patio that is cream colored with brown stripes.  The large built in seating on the side is in red.  The floor is a dark exposed concrete.  The walls are this odd green/blue tinge that reminded me of avatar skin.  We also were listening to some country music, which turned to hip hop, which turned to some top 40. \n\nTo start off, we ordered tea.  Why is this important?  They ran out of tea.\n\nWe ordered the pork spring rolls.  They were nice size, but the peanut sauce came in a plastic cup.  The pork was super dry, and I had to lace a lot of sauce on it.  The spring rolls were lacking something crisp.  It could've used more mint.\n\nWe got the Sage House Special and Rare Steak Pho.  The broth was a murky brown that was too sweet with a very salty undertone.  I think the chef added too much salt so tried to balance with sugar.  Then added too much sugar and added more salt.  Rinse and repeat.  The meat was very well done and chewy.  The rice noodles were undercooked. \n\nThe worse part was after we were done.  I stared at the middle of the table, and I didn't say anything for a few minutes,  I was trying to decide if I had to throw up or not.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of the place was the staff.  They were attentive and friendly. \n\nSage has the location... and it might be a great bar ... but when it comes to food, I could put something better together with a package of instant pho and some beef.  Drop the Vietnamese Cuisine off the name and add on Asian Fusion, and we'll all forgive the food."
1,"Of course since it's Halloween time the place was a touch chaotic, but all things considered (people pulling costumes out of bags, kids running amok, and things being left where they don't belong) the place was clean and organized enough that we were able to find what we were looking for as far as pirate themed decorations for my desk.  \n\nThe staff was nice and helpful at the front end and we checked out in just a few minutes. I recommend hitting them up on a weeknight in the beginning / middle of the week so that you aren't with every one shopping last minute this weekend for costumes / decor.  \n\nCan't wait for the holidays and desk decor at that time!!\n\nOverall: A\nWe will definitely be back considering the upcoming holiday time."
1,"THIS PLACE IS GREAT.  2 huge plates of food, 4 beers, 2 people 30 bucks.  The service is great and the place is spotless."
1,"Great food.  Very generous portions.  I vow to return often.  We ask for mild and it was perfect.  I might get more adventuresome next time, because I like a little heat.  Not so for my husband."
0,"Winghart's is yet another addition to specialty burger places in Pittsburgh. They have a very nice beer selection, and the service was fast and friendly. After an appetizer of Tatonka dip, my wife and I split the shipwreck burger which has brie, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. We got it cooked medium, and it came out more medium rare inside and well done outside. I was expecting more flavors from all the amazing toppings, but I think they were shadowed by the burnt outside of the patty. The fresh cut fries were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.\n\nOne big complaint is that they only give you enough pita wedges for half of the buffalo dip. She came by when we were finishing one of the last ones, and said, \""Would you like more pita? It's $1.99\"". So they knowingly do this just to get an extra $2 out of you. For this reason, I'm dropping them to 2 stars. It's just a really shady business practice."
1,"An interesting museum with lots to see! I spent most of my time here browsing outside, in and out of each of the houses that were recreated to represent different times in history. A lot of old time artifacts from the early 1900s, even if you're not interested in specific NV history, its fascinating to take a look back in time. We spent probably about 2 hours here, without really checking out the inside. I would recommend DO NOT go here in the summer time. It will be waaaaay too hot to walk around. I went in January and it was pretty warm, even then! Good times."
1,"OMG FANTASTIC!! The French toast was soooooo gooood...I special ordered it with just bananas and strawberries, the idea of grapes and melon on French Toast didn't sit right with me. We ate there two days in a row. Both days we sat at the counter because the wait was 20-30+ minutes. They have giant coffee cups which was great - no waiting for refills. Atmosphere is great - old school neon and such. You can even have a cocktail with breakfast. Go it is work the wait."
1,"My admiration for Public House started as my colleagues and I enjoyed our first round of drinks and an incredible meal here upon arriving to Las Vegas. Among many other things, the menu was refreshingly unique compared to the other options that skirt the strip and casinos, but then, the food was delivered by a personable server with some noteworthy and rare selections of wine & beer...the meal was SO good and the drinks made a perfect pair,\n\nBut wait...there's more. The next night we decided to take our clients here for drinks after our dinner meeting - we had about 40 in our party and the service, let alone the drinks and atmosphere were onpoint. The manager's and servers ensured everyone was taken care of and our client feedback was truly spectacular - sure, they were in good company but that was just icing on the cake in comparison to the incredible drinks, service, and atmosphere Public House provided.\n\nWe will be back!"
0,"Nasty.  The food was semi-warm and very oily.  The oil separated from the rest of the food on your plate.\n\nThe building was in disrepair in the dining area, which makes me wonder about the kitchen and cooking/prep areas.  The bathrooms were horrendous.\n\nYes Buffet? Hell no."
0,"I'm still broken-hearted and bewildered a week after dining at Eddies House during Restaurant Week.  My view of restaurant week is participants putting forth their best efforts at low-risk prices to gain the loyalty of new diners who will come spend money on a regular basis.  Apparently Eddie has all the diners he cares to have, because this place barely even phoned it in.  The wait staff was the bright spot--the right level of attentive and informative.  The food was --meh.  The lamb empanadas could have been ground beef for the lack of lamb-tasting goodness.  And there is no excuse for an empanada to be greasy as this one was--I've had better at a hotel banquet.  I won't go into detail on the entrees, since I do not believe the restaurant week offerings were regular menu items, but suffice it to say, I expect a whole lot better execution, particularly when Eddie is in the house, which he was that evening. I'm deeply disappointed. From appetizer to dessert, elements that should have been gooey/sticky/juicy were dry and lackluster. We were expecting flavors that popped, not fizzled.  Other restaurants we visited during Restaurant Week brought their A-game and have been added to our dining rotation.  This place played its bench.  I can think of a lot of better ways to spend $100 bucks.  Reading through the reviews, other diners have had a similar experience here with the regular menu paying full price. So sad.  We won't be back."
0,"a good place to have a couple of beers,but basically is just another HRC,nothing special about it."
1,"I know it's a chain, but awesome selection, great service. I got absolutely no sleep last night and it showed. Massive dark circles under my eyes. The lady who rang me up at the register said, \""Oh my! Get some sleep! You can't come back here looking like this, you poor thing!\""\n\nShe reminded me of a sweet old grandma! As I was walking out with my sandwich, she said \""Remember what I said!!!\"" She had me laughing. Super nice people working here. Service with a smile, definitely choosing this over subway, 100%."
1,"In my opnion, this place is one of the nicest and fanciest chain restaurants in all of the land.  Yes, their prices may be high, and I absolutely agree with Joe that the nutrition of their items are outrageous, but where you want to go somewhere to splurge, this is a pretty good place to do it.  \n\nThe menu is almost overwhelming, and they keep adding more and more items to it.  Actually they did recently just come out with a skinnylicious menu, so that might answer some negative complaints about their portions and nutrition. \n\nBy the way, did we even talk about the cheesecake?  Yes, it is amazing, and yes, they do have an assortment that will keep you wondering which one you want to choose."
0,I had got my screen repaired here which I thought was a good deal.  Turns out I was wrong.  Everything was working fine until about 3 days later when my touch screen stopped working.  I took my phone back and they looked at it and called me the next day saying I needed to purchase another part(some sort of cable) to repair it and that it wasn't covered under warranty.  Total BS because they aren't willing to warranty or stand behind their own work.  Taking my business elsewhere.  Also the Asian guy at the front desk was extremely rude to me.
1,Service was perfect! And the food was more better. I shall return for more Pho and spring rolls. So delicious.\n\n-Above was my first review. This is my second. I love this very friendly and homey place. The food is delicious. I will return again again when I have a taste for Pho. Yum!
1,"COOL SPOT and agree with Sussie H\""s review.    Great concept but they need some things to work on a bit but nevertheless still prefer it over Starbucks. Great coffee. The smokers  CAN smoke outside in their great patio (unlike Starubucks)!  Hope they will stay busy enough to support the 24hrs!  The city really needed something like this which reminds you of northern european places minus the gaming machines!  Lets get out and support such places and not our \""generic\"" casinos so much!"
1,"This is honestly the best coffee I've found in Vegas. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the employees are always so sweet. Amazing pastries too! Try an iced cappuccino, delish!!"
0,"If you believe the 5 star reviews on this dive, you are \""El Schmucko Supremo!\"" NOW I am truly convinced that yelpers in the Tempe area either have no taste buds or give 4 to 5 stars to immigrant restaurant owners out of patronizing liberal sympathy. What is wrong with you people??? This is a filthy little luncheonette serving up chicken that is too dry to swallow and beef that is so tough you can't even chew it! They give you a little salsa on your plate and charge you for tiny pre-filled cups if you want any extra. The woman behind the counter was utterly unfriendly and did nothing but jabber in Spanish with the cook, caring nothing about whether I was happy with my food or needed anything else. This place does NOT qualify as a restaurant, Mexican or otherwise. \n\nThe lack of authentic non-chain Mexican food in Arizona, particularly Tempe, is shameful, tragic and  pathetic. What disappoints all newcomers to Arizona is finding out that the state's proximity to Mexico and its large Mexican-American population has NOT resulted in it being a place where one can find great Mexican food."
0,"You really do get what you pay for....\n\nI stayed here with a group of friends because some were on a budget and we heard good things about TI, so we decided to give it a try...\n\nThe line for checking in was 40 minutes long. It then took 30 minutes to get our three rooms and supposedly... it was an \""upgrade\"", which was a huge disappointment when we actually went into the room, and our friend that stayed there before said it is the same as all the other rooms.... what was even worse was that we requested two rooms with two beds and only one room with king bed. We ended up getting two king bed rooms and only one double bed room... So two guy friends had to share a bed because they got tired of everything and didn't want to wait in line again to fix it.\n\nThe customer service here varies drastically. I found that my credit card had two pending charges of $244.80 each because of a typo for the resort fee. I went to the front desk to ask someone to help me... and it took 20 minutes before I got to talk to someone. Then the person that was talking to me came up with a bunch of excuses and did not apologize even once. I got sick of him and went upstairs and called the front desk with my phone, hoping to talk to someone else. I finally got a manager... but even the manager did not apologize about the typo that created an extra $400 pending charges.\n\nI was also disappointed because my friends and I wanted to watch the Sirens of TI and it was our last night, and we only had time for the last show.... we went half an hour early to stand in the front... only to be told 5 minutes before the show was about to start that it has been cancelled due to technical difficulties.\n\nI honestly have to say that this was one of the most disappointing hotel I ever stayed at."
1,This little market is a hidden gem tucked away on the Boulder Hwy for local lovers of authentic Hispanic foodstuffs.\n\nGreat prices and produce quality; the food counter in back can satisfy the need for a quick bite of mex.  Only the panaderia could use some freshly made baked goods that might still be warm but this is picky on my part\n. \nThere has been a recent re-naming on the exterior wall but everything inside seems to be as it was before even down to the same employees. \nDefinitely worth a peek and some local support before we have to drive another 15 miles to the larger concerns in town.\n\nBue\u00f1o.
1,"Love the trail: the variety, the views, how clean and up kept the park is! It's my favorite place to hike!"
0,Overpriced and overhyped.
1,"The panoramic room upgrade was really nice on floor 62.  Wifi worked fine for us and was included in the resort fee, though you have to click through some web forms that tell you as much.  There is no floor 40 - 49 so it's not as quite high as it sounds, though still an awesome view North to downtown and the mountains.  The view seemed to put my lovely date into a very romantic mood, so good times were had - and the room mirrors seemed to multiply the visual pleasures.  We turned in well after midnight but heard no club thump at our level/side though I knew in advance that the party was on with Diplo spinning.  The gym room was nice and big, open 6A to 8P.  Heavy on machines and treadmills but still enough room and apparatus (free weights, kettles, bands, balls, etc.) to train strength and functional stuff with my trainer/wife, so that experience worked out well.  We didn't see all of the resort in our two night stay, but what I did see, I liked and there was a lot to look at.  The giant hanging fresh flower balls in the atrium were impressive and demanded photos be taken.  Wazuzu food sucked in my opinion and sundries store items were crazy money expensive but those are minor complaints.  Society cafe breakfast was excellent by contrast, though not cheap.  I also dug the Alexander McQueen shop at Wynn with the stylee skull themed gear - though I could barely afford an accessory there, I wanted to buy more.  The resort location rocked, close to the classier end of the strip, adjacent to the Fashion show and Palazzo.  I didn't drop a penny at the casino, but witnessed many other people appearing to enjoy that side of it.  Consensus is that we had a great time on our short stay."
0,"Where to start.... I used to shop here a LOT and still do sometimes (due to it being so close to my home), but the place is well below the standards that every other Walmart seems to have. I have read Made in America (Sam Walton's autobiography), and he would roll over in his grave to see this location.\n\nI would like to note first and foremost that the Pharmacy always gives excellent, consistent quality service. \n\nWe have had two cars damaged just from simple oil changes here (I know, partially our fault for going back). One they stripped the threads on something requiring a trip a to an ACTUAL car repair shop (where we should have gone in the first place), the other they simply didn't put the oil cap back on and I realized it after about 20 miles of freeway driving when the engine gave me trouble, smelt like burnt oil and when I opened up the hood it was EVERYWHERE. They told me they reviewed the tape and their oil change guy (I hesitate to use the word mechanic) did nothing wrong. I was also told the manager would call me after talking to an assistant manager, however, this never happened. This bugs me more than anything else, even the damage to the vehicles. I don't know if it was a mistake on the assistant managers part or if the stores general manager just didn't want to talk to me, but it is absolutely inexcusable from any angle with a company that (usually) has as good of customer service as Walmart does.\n\nAlso, many things are consistently not stocked if you go in the evening. I know they only stock overnight, but I don't understand how they can so consistently not realize that certain items simply need more stock on the shelves. \n\nEmployees often smoke immediately outside the front doors close to closing time so  you can't avoid the smoke.\n\nDefinitely the second worst Wal-Mart I have ever patronized. \n\nOn the bright side, the frustration with this location has made me realize how much better, cleaner and competitively priced the Safeway down the street is!"
0,"The service is usually sub-par, and the food is just \""okay\"". The prices aren't bad and they have a great location, which is the only thing that has kept my business. They usually have good beer on tap, so that's a plus."
0,I went there with my fiance and some out-of-town friends (all are vegans/vegetarians to varying degrees) and everyone thought there was just something lacking about the food. One of us ordered the sampler - the portions were so tiny that it was a very unsatisfying  meal for the price. Two people ordered the BBQ Tempeh and both were disappointed with the flavor - the sauce tasted more like tomato paste than any bbq I'd ever had. Another person ordered the Seed Crusted Oyster mushrooms which ended up being the most flavorful dish although the mushrooms themselves were tough and chewy. \nI love the idea of raw food so I'll give this place another chance. Let's hope they work out some of the kinks in the menu by then!
1,Excellent service and above average fare. Hot salsa and very light tortilla chips can fill you up. I had the Carne Asada burrito.
0,"I love Applebees.  Not this one.  \n\nEvery time I'm hear something gets screwed up.  I'm not kidding.  It's only this Applebees.  On the flip side, the servers are nice and I've gotten to try a lot of renditions of a bbq cheeseburger because it's always differently wrong when I go in.  \n\nThe restaurant has a nice layout and usually has whatever game on tv that should be on but the service is S-L-O-W and I think they may be doing it so we get so hungry while we nibble on our arms we order more food when they do come around.  \n\nLike I said above, I'm a huge Applebee's fan.  Just not this one."
1,"We've been stopping here ever since they opened. We love this place and since it's a short walk from home, it's a winner to us!\n\nThe food is awesome, service is so-so at times, but hey, it's a PUB! \n\nStop in on the weekends and listen to some great live music.. a must for St Patty's Day!\n\nDon't forget to try the new $1.00 street tacos.. the steak are my favorite..mmmm yum :)"
1,"My recent meal at Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails is one that I wished could have lasted forever -- and with the abundance of dishes my companion and I were lucky enough to try (thanks, J. Lauren PR), it was a delightful time that still has my mouth watering.\n\nAnd the food isn't the only draw here, though Chef Stephen Jones' ever-changing seasonal menu is worth the trip. My companion noted the spot seemed like one movie character Ron Burgundy would love, with a \""stay classy\"" feel crafted with lots of wooden accents, sports on at the cozy bar, dim lighting, and comfy leather booths that make diners feel like they're in their own private little worlds.\n\nThe bar and restaurant, nestled into the Hotel Palomar at CityScape in downtown Phoenix, has big city views of the adjoining bustling CityScape atmosphere. The atmosphere is about New York City as you can find downtown, and on a Monday night, there were lots of suits, way more men than women, filing up the bar area. If you're on the prowl for a new guy, head for a cocktail here -- the selection is vast, with stand-out's including the oh-so-refreshing Floradora ($10), with gin, lime, raspberry syrup, soda and ginger; and the French Riviera ($10), with Dolin Blanc, Velvet Falernum, strawberries and club soda. The cocktail menu has a ton of diversity, so there's bound to be something you like.\n\nAs for the menu, Chef Stephen Jones recently revamped more than half of it, with locally sourced menu items that give all the dishes a refreshing taste. The latest menu is seafood-focused, and my pal tried the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon with shaved celery, apple and fennel salad and a potato puree ($9 for a small portion). He said the fish was perfectly cooked, and the sweet elements balanced out the dish.\n\nI had to try some of my favorite soup, gazpacho, a cup of which came with the perfect fresh veggies garnish to stir into the cold blended soup ($5). I've had my fair share of gazpacho soups in Spain, and this was hands-down one of my favorites. It was thick and rich, which I loved, and perfectly flavored.\n\nWe also started with the Crows Dairy Goats Milk Yellow Corn Cake ($5-$10, based on portion), which was topped with a red onion jam and marinated spring squash. Everything about this was delightful, from the consistency and buttery flavor of the corn cake, to the perfect jam topping that was a pleasant surprise that worked. The marinated veggies added some savoriness, and I wanted more.\n\nI loved that all the dishes are designed for trying, since there are sampler portions of just about everything on the menu. My companion got a small portion of the Lamb Meatballs, with dandelion greens, potatoes, chickpeas, and red onion yogurt ($9). It's got to be one of the most innovative, fanciest dishes you could try at that price.\n\nChef Stephen also sent out an appetizer of Shisito Peppers ($5-$8), which is something I've actually never had before. The peppers were fun to nosh on and were tame enough for anyone's palate.\n\nI ordered a plum tomato flatbread, made with house-pulled mozzarella ($12). All the ingredients were stand-out and high-quality, but I've had a flatbread like this at St. Francis. Opt for the more outside-the-box offerings if you go to Blue Hound.\n\nChef Stephen was also kind enough to send out a lemon and fennel sorbet, which was light and refreshing and a perfect meal-ender -- even though I had insisted I was too full for dessert, I couldn't help eating every bit of my portion. The fennel offering was unlike anything I'd ever tasted before -- it was a really interesting flavor that definitely gave the dessert a farm-to-table taste. I'd give the dessert points on uniqueness alone.\n\nNot only was it a pleasure to meet Chef Stephen and gobble up his amazing food in a relaxed but classy atmosphere, the service was also impeccable. Like the hotel it's housed in, Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails strives to make its customers feel at home, too."
1,"Who could not like  place full of fun costume jewelry that is extremely well merchandised?   Everything is arranged by color/style and change regularly.  Jewelry, purses, sunglasses, flip-flops, belts, phone cases and some clothing (which i've never looked at)  Even though the store isn't huge it's easy to spend a couple hours there.\n\nPersonally, I work up an appetite with a visit there, crossing the street for another shop so usually saunter down to a restaurant and grab a bite to eat or maybe a cup of coffee."
1,"Went here on a Tuesday night due to Groupon purchase with a party of 4. It was a slow evening but I was still surprised of how the restaurant filled up by the end of our meal. I reserved beforehand and we were brought to our table promptly.\n\nThe waiter took awhile to get to us but he was very nice. He probably also needed some presentation lessons of the menu but we didn't really care. The atmosphere was lovely too. The party of four ordered:\n\nFresh Grilled Veggie Salad (so-so, sauce was good)\n\nGreen salad with goat cheese and hazelnut (cheese was good; they just wanted some veggies)\n\nFresh mushroom bruschetta (I expected more from this, it was so-so)\n\nFresh salmon tartar with capers (I'm a big fan of tartar, and this was delicious)\n\nTraditional Spanish ham fritters (a big surprised - it was pretty good!)\n\nClassic Spanish potato and onion omelet (the sauce that came with it was heavenly)\n\nSpanish Sausage with potatoes (this was one of my favorite dishes! I thought it was be just mediocre, but it surprised me in everyway!)\n\nBeef shish kabob ala parrilla with onions and peppers (it was okay, only one stick so i wasn't too impressed)\n\nFilet mignon medallion with mushroom sauce (DEFINITELY get this! We got it cooked at medium and it was perfect!)\n\nand the Chocolate coffee layered cake (contrary to what others said, this was also really good! Not too sweet, it was gone within seconds - loved it!)\n\nSO, what I would recommend: salmon tartar, ham fritters, spanish sausage with potatoes, filet mignon, and chocolate coffee layered cake. \n\nI would come again if I crave tapas!"
1,"Here's the breakdown: \n\nHostess: Friendly/Informative\nService: Attentive/Friendly\nHalibut: Absolutely delightful. Might be the best I've had. \nSalmon: Not fresh. Very unfortunate, as the rest of the dish was great.\nRatatouille: My first experience. It was delicious.\nWine: Expensive...but excellent selection.\n\nWill I be back?: Do things that happen in Vegas, stay in Vegas?"
1,"First time at Carlito's and was worth the 20 minute drive. I had a chicken and black bean burrito smothered with green chile sauce. I added jalapenos, lettuce, onions and cilantro to it. They were quite generous with the green chile and the sauce was so tasty.  Also ordered the sides of rice, retried beans and the sopapilla.  The rice and beans were okay, but the sopapilla had me at the first bite. It was piping hot and we drizzled it with honey and it was amazingly delicious. Can't wait to go back and eat again."
1,"This is my roommate's favorite AYCE sushi in town, and I'm always happy with a good crunch roll. My friends adore the seafood salad and no-name roll."
1,"I counted 20 beers on draft, all were very good. They keep a few bottles of wine around too, if that is your thing. Great place to visit, well lit and a great addition to the Arizona craft brew scene. Keep up the good work."
0,"There is nothing terrible about this restaurant but there is nothing that good either - average food.   Given the price, it is definitely not worth it unless location is your primary concern."
0,I have given this place a try twice. The first time my roomie and I ordered a white pizza we were super excited to get it only to get food poisoning and be hostage to our house for the next 48 hours. So I think fluke incident went back and had a pizza and wings and it was sub par. Not a great place to eat in my opinion just greasy bar food.
1,The food is always so good and the staff works hard to take care of you even though they are always slammed. The only issue is the noise level. Also the rosemary on the fries... But that is just my preference :)
1,"Whether you're grabbing a quick to-go lunch or an evening of drinks, rolls, and conversation this is the spot. Always delicious sushi, dumplings, and creative presentation.\n\nThe seating isn't the best but the sushi more than makes up for it. It's worth at least one visit."
0,"i was referred here by another dentist because they thought Emergency Dentist had a lab on site.  I had a tooth that needed replacing immediately.  After an exam i was told it would take 7-10 days to receive my flipper, it was being sent to a lab.  After following up on the 7 & 8 day and nothing had arrived for me I called on day 11 and was told 2-3 weeks.  After conversing with Robin she followed up with the lab and would have my flipper overnight delivery with guarantee delivery of 10:30.  That would be Christmas Eve.  So much for guarantee, by 2 pm i receivrd a call.  I received my flipper.  It doesn't match the shape or color of my other teeth.  Not happy at all with the lab work."
1,"Place is legit, always friendly, always fresh and always busy.   Cheap too, as far as fast food burgers go what else can you ask for????"
0,"This is a chain restaurant.  Been to another location with a better dining experience.  I don't mind waiting for a table, but I do expect decent food and service.  \n\nThe wait was over 30 minutes.  We weren't told that the counter was first come, first serve however. I guess not too bad for mid-Saturday morning.  The waitress was extremely rushed.  I asked if the corned beef hash was chunks or minced.  She said small pieces that are minced.  I watched the cook divide a plate of eggs into 2....not what I want to see.  The corned beef was strips.  I tried to eat it anyway but it tasted watered down...no flavor.  \n\nVery loud, small environment.  Not what I was looking for at all.  Much better breakfast options in town."
0,We come here at least 52 times a year.  Lately things have been going down hill.  Today I ordered the Short Rib Hash because I heard it was so good.  It came out burnt to a crisp.  I mean the meat was so cooked it powdered when touched.  Burnt to a cinder comes to mind.  The last few times our food has either been overcooked or undercooked.  We are going to give the place a break for a while until they change back the managers or whatever is going on...
1,"Using iPhone app Siri, when we pulled up the restaurant, it showed 5 stars, one review. When I went to review myself, all if the sudden, 3 reviews, 3 stars. \nSeems pretty good though. Very pleased with jalape\u00f1o poppers. The Amigo2 was slot spicier than the poppers. Not bad, just not expected. Sweet endings was also pretty & pretty tastey. :)"
0,"I was casing this place to see if it could measure up and be included in the lunch rotation.  Instead, it became an anecdote.  Or maybe I didn't measure up, and was being encouraged not to include Pita House in my lunch rotation.  About halfway through my visit, I knew this was a one-time visit.  All the signs were piling up.  I entered the take out section and was led to the dining area.  Obviously a first timer, the waitress seemed bemused by my newness and uncompelled to offer any assistance.  Maybe she knew I wasn't returning before I did.  I felt like I was being marked for sides, drinks, and up sales rather than being welcomed.  By the time the food came, I had already decided not to return unless it was the best lunch ever and the meal was between okay and good, but closer to good.  There are so few places where rudeness is part of the charm of the place.  It is just so hard to pull off.  I had the chicken shawarma.  The chicken cubes were juicy, and the tahini sauce was good, but lacking.  On the plus side, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  Next!!"
0,"Bought the \""delicious\"" Mesquite smoked almonds.

This is not to make you aware of new products, but to hype unhealthy inferior slop, in hopes some chump, YOU, will by them, & hopefully not return them. Guess again sphincters ! Mine are going back !!!"
1,"I had to write a review update because we had great experience here last Saturday. To start off my fianc\u00e9 had constantly been asking me to give them another shot since our last visit because the pizza and wings were so good. I finally gave in on Saturday because I too was craving pizza and Jimmy and Joe's definitely has great pizza, it was just the service that was not so good in the past. So we got there around 6:30pm and it was rainy and cold that evening so as you could imagine, the small restaurant was packed and a very busy place.\n\nWe went to the front to place our order and a really nice, younger gentleman took our order (I didn't catch his name unfortunately). He was wearing a Disney pin lanyard which I immediately thought was awesome because I am a Disney fanatic and I too was wearing one of my pins on my jacket. We instantly connected over it. He took our order and we decided to eat in. It was quite packed inside (very small interior) but a nice couple was leaving and kindly gave us their table. As we were waiting I observed the very nice gentleman who took our order, really taking the lead and running the front service and giving pizza orders the back of the house. Finally it looks like the owner got the message and maybe hired someone who actually has got it together. This is the first time I have been in here where the restaurant actually looked like it was being managed and running smoothly especially on a busy night.\n\nOur pizza came out, a 14 inch with green chilies, pepperoni and onion and it was absolutely delicious as usual. One thing that Jimmy and Joe's does right is pizza and now that they have service back on track it makes me a happy customer. I hope that they can hold on to the gentleman who took our order. \n\nI will be back..."
0,"I probably should've read the reviews that were written post grand re-opening, but instead, I figured that DD had to be better than I remembered.  Not the case!\n\nI stopped by this location this morning thinking about a coffee and maybe a breakfast sandwich.  Unfortunately, they were out of eggs!  Out of eggs?  Are you kidding me?  Ok... then I glanced at the muffin selection for an alternative.  No bran muffins or corn muffins (my two favorites).  That sucks!  So, I ordered an iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla flavoring and left in a flurry.  I took a sip and it was pretty gross - way too much syrup!  I came home, dumped half of it out, added some soy milk and it's now at least drinkable.\n\nNeedless to say, not so impressed with the new (and not so improved) DD!"
0,Bring your own water and food if your exhibiting or walking a show. It's overpriced and the lines are ungodly long.
0,"Worst Chipotle I've ever been to. They skimp on everything to the point you think it's a joke. We kept going back thinking it was just a fluke, continues to happen. Also whether there's a line or not, the service is really slow. \n\nThey literally sprinkle everything, to the point they make a normal scoop and then pour most of it back. \n\nWill be going to the 92nd/Shea location from now on."
0,"Okay...here's the deal with Bottled Blonde- this is like an awesome bar for your early 20's. However for my halfway to thirty (okay fine, a little closer than halfway) self, I've just well...outgrown it. I would prefer a more mellow place that's not as crowded and loud (god, I can't believe I just said that!). BUT here's how I would party here going forward:\n\nRather than waiting until 10 or 11 at night, I suggest you roll in after work and grab some pizza, drink and stick around for when it starts getting clubby. By then, you'll have a good buzz going. \n\nI know what you're thinking, \""Why the harsh two star rating when you've admitted that this place just wasn't your style?\"" Here it goes: what really bugged me was that someone shoved my friend out of the way while we were there. I turned around to see what bitch pulled that move and to my extreme horror saw that she was sporting the red hot shorts uniform. IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE!!! WHAT? How rude is that? I mean, I get it, my friend was D-RUNK and probably in her way but still. I would have complained to a manager but seriously it takes a hundred years to flag down a bartender, I can only imagine how much longer it would be to find a manager."
0,Two stars just for the fun of it...  but might be the dirtiest place I've seen...
1,"Absolutely love this place and look forward to every visit. I try something different each time and have always really enjoyed the food.\n\nOne but of feedback, Please consider a more seamless ordering process as I end up pulling my wallet out to pay at least 3x per visit.....When ordering at the bar, entrees, and dessert."
0,"Terrible!!! My friend and I split a pizza meal here and it was horrible.\n\nWe had the veggie pizza which came cold and they just popped it in the oven however we needed to go back and have it reheated which was a pain.\n\nThe pizza meal came with a slice of pizza and a side which you could chose pasta or salad, we picked a caesar salad for  and the meal come to about 8.69 or something, you could also add on a drink and garlic bread for an additional 1.99 we went this that....\n\nThe garlic bread was hard to chew, the only thing we enjoyed was the salad and the portion was so tiny.\n\nWhat a waste of $12. We ended up tossing out our food and going else where, such a shame as we thought we made a good choice as this place had a long line compared to all the others in the food court...\n\nWe made a bad choice..."
0,"Why is it, there are 20 something registers but only 3 open? Every time I go there in the evening, there's always a line and I mean line as in 10-15 people in 2 lines. \nAlso why the crap do I need to show my receipt when you just seen me walk from the register after paying for my items?"
0,This place is a Dump and closing its doors forever is imminent.
1,"Food is fabulous, great selection, staff are a dream and the manager attentive!  Can't go wrong here!"
1,"Best stone crab in the US? Probably. I have had crab a lot of places and never been disappointed with Joe's. It a great place for a group meal in Las Vegas, order a bunch of food and pass and share. Excellent service both times I have been here. They have great combo platters for a starter be sure to give it a try. I can't comment on the steaks or other foods because why would you bother if your at Joe's....have the damm crab. :)"
0,"Fake super expensive Japanese food, lacking in freshness, with staff lacking in etiquette! (in all senses of the word). \n\nInitially, I was totally hesitant to go here as I did not believe that it was a real Japanese restaurant. I just can't see the Wynn hosting anything that is not glamorous trash. But my friends were insistent as we had to go to Blush for an evening of super loud music and flirting with prostitute waitresses post din din. \n\nAs we walk in, I immediately notice that the sushi bar keeps a huge distance between the chef and patron. How can I eat Omakase (chef's choice) in this way? No Japanese greeting either. No bowing. I am tempted to get my gold encrusted kendo practice sword from my Ferrari parked outside. Actually, no Japanese anywhere in sight. Of course, there are Asian waiters which is a nice pretend visual to confuse the Gai Jin. \n\nMy spider sense tells me to leave again but alas, my friends won't hear of it. 450 dollars later, for 4 of us, and that's without really being full, we are all annoyed. Me being the most as I am in the \""I told you so\"" phase of the meal. You should trust that I am a lot of fun, especially when we reach this part of the evening.\n\nService - Well, they took about 20 minutes to serve us or even offer a drink, then placed our sake bottle half way across the room but never bothered to come to pour it unless we flagged them down. At one point, I am sure that the table next to us was drinking it instead. In addition, they brought food that we didn't order, failed to bring food that we did and while the waitress was sort of helpful, none of the etiquette or dignity of even a low class Japanese spot was to be found anywhere. Then halfway through the meal, we were treated to a waitress switch. Try and find that in Japan where the relationship between server and patron can reach levels of the profound.\n\nFood -\n1. UNI - Fish smell and fish taste, and not the good kind. This is a huge no no. I was actually concerned about being sick after taking a bite. Almost made me wish I was at the super-overpriced Sushi Gen where at least the Uni is fresh.\n2. TUNA - Rubber\n3. SALMON - So So\n4. IKURA - fishy\n5. ROLLS - Bland, lacking in flavor\n\nThe rest was honestly not worth mentioning. Everything was rubbery, not very fresh at all or at least 2nd or 3rd grade quality. The yakitori stuff was ok, especially the meatball. Only thing that tasted decent was the Foie Gras that my friend ordered. But that wasn't even Japanese.\n\nI sort of feel like so many people get ripped off here that they all want to say how bloody good it is to justify it to themselves or their friends. Or more likely, to show off. And when compared to PF Chang or some fake Korean sushi place, maybe it is good...um...no...it isn't. It isn't. It isn't even good enough to be an alternative to grabbing one of the fish out of the aquarium and taking a bite out of its head.\n\nAgain, a nice fake Japanese spot with a solid sounding Japanese name, and a whole slew of celebrity, social climbing momos to sit and rave on how good their disgusting seared uni cracker jack roll is! Wow. Bad bad bad. I guess when I saw the owner of American Apparel at a table nearby chomping away with one of his heroine sheek models, I should have got up and ordered a pizza to the slot machine outside.\n\nOr for a couple 100 bucks more, I could have flown to Japan and had a fantastic meal at the airport, and a quick fling with a stewardess in one of those spacious and technologically advanced Japanese bathrooms. Yah, they still call them stewardess in Japan. Fly ANA, and fly on ANA! Arigato gozaimasu!"
1,"Four stars is for the seating and feel of the place, as well as attentive bartenders both times I've been. I think the generous-sized couch/lounge thing is the complement this place offers compared to other downtown spots. It makes for a good meet-up location when you have a decent-sized crew.\n\nI might be a cheapskate, but the beer is a bit pricey ($3.50 for a PBR = the R word. I know Pabst advertises on NPR an all now, but it's still the same swill)."
1,"Was at Salt this past Friday and thoroughly enjoyed myself. \nI brought a date here and it was the perfect atmosphere to have a few drinks, some appetizers, and get to know each other. Our bartender was superb, recommending drinks, and being super friendly.\n\nBite sized Nachos chicken\nFillet Sliders\nThe Manhattan - Drink"
1,"Visited the Miracle Mile location in Las Vegas twice. \n\nMy wife and I had dinner our first night - we just wanted something simple and inexpensive and the Earl provides said same.\n\nI ordered the Italian and was a bit surprised when it arrived warm - all the Earl 'signature' sandwiches are served panini style. As noted previously, the sandwich is about the size of a 6-inch Subway. I probably would have liked the sandwich better had the meats been cold as I was thinking more of a Hoagie style Italian. I also ordered the broccoli and cheddar soup - which was quite good.\n\nThe next morning we had breakfast at the Earl of Sandwich - it is the only place in the Miracle Mile that opens before 7 AM - it's Vegas Baby - and my wife was attending a conference, so we needed an early breakfast. I had the egg, cheddar and bacon sandwich and my wife ordered the ham variation. Both were quite good.\n\nFast service, reasonable prices and a decent sandwich makes the Earl worth a visit."
1,"I enjoy the cupcakery very much. Every time I've had them they have been light and moist, without too much frosting, but good flavors. And I'll admit, I'm a sucker for glitter. I especially loved their cherry one (with a cherry baked right in) but I haven't seen it recently. :("

1,"My best friend used to work at the Emiliano's in the North Hills and didn't have great things to say about the place (namely that her paychecks repeatedly bounced) so I was sort of skeptical.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere was no wait for a table for 2 at 6:00 on a Friday night.  Our waiter asked us for drinks, promptly brought them, and was great about refilling them throughout the meal.  The menu is pretty extensive, as is the drinks/dessert menu.  I was not feeling any of the vegetarian options (no cheese chiles rellenos :( ) so I did a Create Your Own Combo, as did my roommate.  I got 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and refritos ($8.49); he got a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a beef quesadilla with rice and refritos ($9.49).  We were both enjoying the free chips and salsa when the food arrived.  Almost too quickly - makes me wonder if it was pre-prepared and just microwaved.\n\nAt any rate, it was good.  There's not too much to say about cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans, but they were good.  My roommate enjoyed all his food as well.  We ordered a fried ice cream for dessert, which was very good.  Total before tip was about $28.\n\nI really enjoyed this place - it wasn't crowded, service was really quick, and it seemed like a pretty good value.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back."
0,Disgusting calzone. Cost 20 bucks. Delivery 20 minutes late. Pizza just okay.
1,"If I were a cow and were to be slaughtered, I wish my delicious body would be brought here, for I know I would be taken care of with the utmost delicacy and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe way I discovered Bachi Burger was by my friends bringing me back a fifth of a burger while I was in vegas.  I was already full from eating at a buffet so I didn't go with them but when I tried their left overs, I took a mental note that I had to go back one day.\n\nFast forward 3 months later, I came here with Ellie, my brother, and his girlfriend and I was amazed at the taste of the burgers.  We went for a late lunch, around 4pm and we were seated immediately.\n\nI must admit, the environment of the place was a little too dim for my taste and there was quite a bit of a smokey atmosphere but I'll try not to sweat the small stuff.  \n\nOur group ORDERED OXTAIL FRIES, a SHOGUN BURGER, and BBQ BACON BURGER.  \n\nThe taste was extraordinary to say the least.  I really enjoyed the oxtail fries which was about $12. The entire group split it and my only wish was that there was more meat.\n\nMy lady ordered the shogun burger which was a hefty $25 but it included what I believe was unagi.  She split half of her burger with another but she said it was well worth it.\n\nAs for me, my BBQ BACON burger was exquisite.  I loved the bread and the meat was cooked perfectly.  It was tender, juicy, delicious and well put together.  I wish I knew what kind of bread they used because it was perhaps the best burger bread I've ever had.  It reminds me of the bread from in n out which never crumbles while you eat it and it had a somewhat shiny, buttery texture. My burger COST about $15.  I'm not usually one to eat gourmet type burgers but this was well worth it.\n\nFor DESSERT, I ordered a strawberry tart with vanilla ice cream.  It was a solid dish but it didn't \""wow\"" me like the burger did.  Next time I'll pass on it but all in all, I had a great experience.  This has my award for best burger (so far.)\n\nYou gotta go here!"
1,"just got here from california and seems like all the equipment here are newer and in better condition.  \n\nI usually go late at night, so havent had any issues with the gym being crowded.\n\nHavent tried any other 24hr in the vegas area....but so far its better than most in california."
1,"Great shrimp rolls and Thai iced tea. The waitress is a joy. The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way. The only reason we didn't give 5 stars was because of the take-out ambience. Great for take-out, bad for eat-in. Great value."
0,"I really wanted to love this place sinec it was so close to home. But it really fell short. \n\nInitial impression of the place was that it looked nice and very clean. \n\nWe were excited and tried the Wagyu burger and a Ronin burger. Took a while for the server to take the order but we figured it must be busy and it's ok if the food is worth it. \n\nSat aroung for 15 mins, looked around and some people waited for about 15 mins and still didnt get water and have orders taken. Others looked like they have been waiting for a while to get thier orders...\n\nHow long does it take to cook a hamburger, its not an elaborate meal or anything. \n\nSo food finally came and we were not impressed. \n-Salt and Pepper fries: man they smelled soo good but soft, soggy fries are hard to over look expecially when they look store bought. \n-Wagyu burger: the plate looked very poor in presentation, a $10 burger with the add ons should look a little nicer, a burger in the middle of a plate with nothing else looks dinky, maybe leave it open faced with side sauces or fries to fill space for presentation. \nRonin Burger: It was ok, nothing to write home to mom about, the meat tatsed the same as the Wagyu one though. \n\nAsked for our check and took forever that to come as well. Seems like the servers take the order and just hang out at the food window instead of walk around and give refills or give any kind of service at all. \n\nOverall, this dont not impress at all. Same price as the Burger Bar (minus the foie gras, truffles of course) but not even close to the service at all. Not worth a second try, we both agreed an In-N-Out meal would of been better and less than half price."
0,"My fondest memories of this building are when it was Eegee's.\nIt was at least useful years later as an AlphaGraphics.\n\nGuns Etc is... a gun store. Ostensibly, anyway. Most of the time the staff are doing their best not to sell anything, which is baffling for a store with a substantial inventory. Even on the rare day the staff aren't actively ignoring or driving off customers, the inflated prices take care of it.\n\nOnce you walk out of Guns Etc in disappointment/disgust, you can at least walk across the parking lot and comfort yourself with some decent New York Chinese at Red Dragon or some tasty Filipino fare at Jeepney Bistro."
0,"I'm a meh here too - right now they've got a 3 course special starting at 9.99, so that was nice but the food was on the meh side.  My lemon grilled chicken portion was huge (a whole half smallish chicken), and the mashed potatoes are pure cream.  Service was friendly but really slow.  I'm not sure if I'd come back here if we were at Red Rock again."
0,"I love coming here but today decided to come for lunch and worst service we were sat right away but then no one came to check on us for about 15 min then a bus boy came to check on us and said \""I'm not your waiter but ill get you drinks\"" we said who is then and he said \""I dont kno,were trying to figure that out.  They cut a lot of people and that's why we are short handed. \"" he was great and ended up waiting on us the whole time. He needs a raise if it werent for him I would say I would never come back.  I dont blame him for bit checking on us since I'm sure this isn't his usual duties."
1,Fastest year of my life! The growth panel is complete and we couldn't be happier. The last session was the most fun. Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I didn't think we'd get huge laughs and smiles. I was wrong. Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots. They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward. \n\nWhen I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place. Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play... she didn't cry (remember she's been having separation anxiety). She actually had a fun time. They were really nice and patient with us.
0,"Stopped by this location after a doctor appointment because we we're starving...\n\nThe girl at the cashier station didn't acknowledged us because she was having issues trying to figure out how to split a payment...\n\nOnce she did say \""hi\"" to us and took us to a booth that still had the tip from the previous customers we waited for about 15 minutes and no one even offered us drinks so we just walked out...\n\nFound a Farmer Boys a mile an a half away & had a great meal there for half the price of what we would've spent at Denny's..."
1,"Very clean family owned business. Food is top, coming from someone who's knowledgable on Persian cuisine. Fav. Place to eat at whenever hungry: Sprinkle that sumac on yar meat!!"
1,"I love the margherita pizza here!! Right amount of sauce, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and big leaves of basil! Delicious, hot, perfect!!! They get their bread from the Breadsmith off Power and McDowell. Its great!!! They have great wine, pizza, drinks and desserts! Come check out this adorable place! There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!\n\nTo bad they don't deliver!!!"
0,"I had breakfast buffet here. This is a hotel breakfast type of place. Pretty limited selection. Their hot items were: bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, and cheese blintz. They also had omelette and waffle station. 4 kinds of cereals, oatmeal with topping station, fruits and juices.  \n\nPOSITIVE: no long wait, buffet so no long wait for your food. \n\nNegative: very limited selection."
0,"One word sums this place up - overrated! It was a Sunday and I tried locating a Thai or Pho establishment and everything nearby was closed except for Tea Lite Cafe.\n\nLocated in a large big box shopping center Tea Lite Cafe is small and was fulled to capacity. When I inquired to the Asian if they had a sign in waiting list he replied no so we had to wait and then place our order and then waited to be seated. \n\nWhen I received my plate of bean spouts, mints, lime and slice jalapenos the portion was the smallest ever for a Pho restaurant. The bowl of pho I received was small with a small amount of meats and was over priced in my opinion. In addition the broth tasted sweet and tasted like sugar was added to the broth!  I don't add any sauces when I eat Pho so this just didn't taste natural at all.\n\nI would not return here again."
1,"As we walked in the door with a 3 yr old, they suggested we sit in the back corner.  Ok... But that probably wasn't a bad idea, seeing as how our child promptly spilled her sprite on the floor requiring the very accommodating waiter to mop it up.  When he saw our child crying he reassured them by saying in jest, \""the bus boy breaks 7 dishes a night!\""  Anyway on to the food.  We started with the bruschetta appetizer which was really good.  I especially enjoyed the white bean on toasted bread and grilled onions.  My husband ordered the hanger steak and appreciated the tenderness and the flavor of the horseradish bread.  I ordered the bolognese somehow thinking there was pasta involved.  There is not.  However the polenta was rich and creamy and our three year old enjoyed it immensely.  The sauce was good too. I was disappointed by not seeing anything \""green\"" on the dish.  Salads are about $14 a piece!  But the meal was delicious.  Special kudos for our waiter checking and double checking on the ingredients.  We have serious food allergies in our family. We could hear him asking the chef.  Nice!"
1,Came over here after work to hang out with some coworkers and my girlfriend. We had a great time. During happy hour for $5 you get a pretty big glass and can have whatever you want in it. That is a great deal.\nThe food was OK. Good bar food but nothing blowing your socks off. Service was OK too.\nDidn't play any pool this time but they have a large pool table area. The entire other half of the building to be exact and there were a lot of people playing pool over there.\nMy coworkers and I will definitely be back for happy hour after work. Since we had such a good time and it is literally right across the street from our work. We haven't done happy hour in quite a while after work and it is nice to find a great place that is right across the street.
0,"If I could give them zero stars, I would. All they could say to me was, \""We can't help you, we don't know what's wrong with your phone.\"" There was not a service tech working? hey couldn't offer me any ways to help solve the problem. They didn't even have any extra batteries to test whether it was a simple battery problem. I waited 20 mins and drove out there for nothing. Worthless customer service. To make it worse, he told me it was time for a new phone. I have had my S4 for 1 year. It's not time for a new phone. It's time for a new service provider."
1,"Decided to try a new place ,so we came here. We're seated and waited on quickly. Ordered two patron margaritas and cheesy crisp with green chile. Salsa and chile very mild but not bad. I ordered burro favorito carnitas red enchilada style. My wife had combo platter. Besides the mild chili it was awesome great flavor and good size plate. My wife loved the combo platter and these bite size what I can only explain as a ball were great tasting had oozing cheese and pieces of green chili fried in a crust. And our server Patrick was the best server we have had at any restaurant we have been to. Friendly, attentive, and alway\nMade sure we liked everything and that we were doing good. So if you come here you might want to look for this guy. Great customer service."
0,We visited Montreal on a cold winter day and wandered into Montreal poutine. The best thing going for this place is the location in old Montreal ... Unfortunately the prices are too high and the poutine was cold! Our smoked meat sandwiches were small for what we paid.
0,"This is a bitter review.  The place doesn't really deserve 1 star, but I was asked to leave by a bouncer, and when I opened my mouth to protest, he grabbed me and escorted me to the door.  There is NO reason for a bouncer to get physically aggressive with a non-aggressive patron.  This guy was a meathead, and even seemed to have some roid rage if I'm not mistaken.  When are bars going to learn that by employing these types you lose business?  I would never go back there, and that means anytime I'm with my friends we will avoid the place.  DIPLOMACY is the name of the game in bouncing.  If you must kick someone out, do it in a discreet, non-confrontational way (unless the person was being violent to begin with, in which case feel free to put him in a half-nelson and toss him out the door)"
1,"By far one of my favorite taco places in town!\n\nI love it so much that I come at least once a week for lunch! I either order your basic tacos (yum) or the gordita. \n\nThe gordita, carne asada with everything is a huge meal. I am so stuffed when i finish it, but it is so worth it! \n\nThe staff is very friendly and it is everything you would expect from a taco shop. It reminds me of my days in Mexico and eating street tacos :o)\n\nThey should start a taco/ gordita punch card, after 10 get one free!!!"
0,"Two things Mineo's taught me:\n1) There is such thing as too much cheese.\n2) Some pizza slices really do need to be blotted.  Normally, I roll my eyes when people blot their pizza--what's pizza without some grease?--but Mineo's slices are an exception. \n\nThe sauce here is pretty good, but as is the case with the cheese, there's too much of it.  I've burned my finger holding down the cheese as I bite into my slice so I don't end up pulling off all of it.  I thought the crust leaned towards being a little too crispy.\n\nI like the paneled walls and the framed photos--check out the Life magazine cover of young Molly Ringwald.  But I don't come to a pizza place for ambiance, so it's not enough to keep me from looking at other places for a superior slice."
0,Food was out of the microwave. It look forever. Over priced for food from Costco. Margaritas were so strong we couldn't drink them for $15 I should have a balanced drink I can consume.   Won't be back.
1,"Fr\u00e9quente ce restaurant fran\u00e7ais classique depuis plus de 40ans(la lucarne)nom,dessins et surtout les toilettes blasph\u00e9matoires ,mais c'est aussi je crois le nom du proprio.clentele et service agr\u00e9ables ,carte de vins et prix corrects.les abats sont toujours au menu et r\u00e9ussis.merci"
1,"I will admit, I was skeptical, no...I downright thought this would be cheaply done, hokey and boring.  I am glad I was wrong as I caught myself saying \""cool\"" and \""impressive\"" almost as many times as my girlfriend and kids! \n\nThe facility itself isn't anything special and itself didn't have a \""Wow Factor\"", but the 3D miniature gulf course was fun!  The holes were typical and if it had been any other course I would have been disappointed, but the introduction of 3D really changed things.  The painting, layers and lighting really do add a whole new dimension to the game.  There were times when you couldn't tell where the hole really was, and then depending on where you ball landed and it's color, it looked like it was floating.  The theme changes and they really did do a good job on making it 3D.\n\nThe Lasertag course is standard with standard equipment and obstacles.  The gun and vest worked as expected so don't expect to get perfect shots or hits every time, because it just won't happen.  We used a Groupon, so the whole evening was pretty cheap and well worth the investment.  We have already talked about coming back without the kids and with a group of friends to do the miniature golf again."
1,"Best acai bowl in Arizona! Jamba Juice acai toppers don't count...I think they blend grapes into theirs which really thins them out. Thrive makes them perfectly and uses fresh, ripe fruit. I would come here everyday but my wallet would protest. It is a bit of a splurge for a broke college student but definitely worth it. Friendly staff and great acai bowls!"
1,Love this full size Starbucks at the Harris Teeter at Morocroft.  It is great to grab a cup of coffee before starting to grocery shop.  I have been here dozens of times and never more than 3-5 people in line.  Since some Starbucks can have 10-20 people in line this is a perk!  They have tables inside as well as a huge covered patio.  You could even grab some lunch at the deli and a cup of joe at Starbucks and eat on the patio.
0,"Left POMO tonight very disappointed . Showed up at 6:30 pm without a reservation, and was quoted 45 minutes for a seat inside for a party of 7, and we specifically asked for a seat inside. After taking a seat at at the bar for 1:10 minutes, and watching 5 tables be given away, we asked if our table was ready. They said it was and walked us outside. We stated we specifically asked for a table inside due to the heat, and were told that all tables inside were reserved for the night and only outside tables would be an option. This was obviously very disappointing, and we left hungry. I can't comment on the food, but the customer service, and manager need help. I will skip this place in the future. There are far too many outstanding restaurants in Scottsdale to settle for a subpar experience such as this."
1,"i truly AM in love with lavo....it's much better the second time.  good food, cool bathroom sinks, my favorite chocolate pudding cake thing they have..with dulce de leche sauce and vanilla ice cream, and good times.\nwent here for a second time with a group of friends, to celebrate birthdays and an engagement!  lavo was great about taking our reservation of 13.  we waited a little bit to be sat.. the service was good.\nwe all ordered something different.. so for our group of 4 in one area of the table decided to get a bunch of different kinds of dishes to share..  \nwhat we ordered:\n-bone-in ribeye..which came with 4 different dipping sauces  (all so freakin good.) tender steak and delish sauces.\n-paella..which had seafood, chicken and chorizo! soo tasty.\n-kobe meatball..that had some marinara sauce deal with it. (which was comped, because they forgot to bring it out, yay!) also awesome.\n-fries with their ketchup sorbet (cold ketchup)..weird..never had that before.\n-margherita pizza...which had potatoes...lobster! and caramelized onions. so different.\n\n we didn't end up going to the club upstairs afterwards, but it looked pretty busy and cool.\n\nlike last time.. loved the super modern decor and random decorations..\n\ni want to be there every time i'm in vegas."
0,"Absolutely horrid customer service. To print a word doc. from USB 1 sheet of paper would cost me 5 bucks and tells me kinkos would charge the same amount to login myself and print is a absolute lie. The owner couldn't even look me in eye as he told me. I even told him if I went to kinkos and showed him the receipt he said he would ban me from the store. I'm not sure about the rest of the services, I just know ill never go back.\n*update* i spoke the truth i know exactly what i experienced, and i am not being unreasonable. As i told u before its your business your price, Dont tell customers lies about your competitor is my problem. I could go even in more detailed what happened that day, but ill let you save face."
1,"I love hot, fresh, flavored donuts. This place is so tiny and the donuts are so good the whole experience was done in a flash.\n\nAs short the experience, as short the review:\n* Super tiny shop-in and out\n* Helpful little picture signs hang on the racks telling you what they have. BOOM!\n* You're steps away from the register when you enter the door. Panic set in for there were a lot of little signs when I visited. Dear lord what do I want? I'll get theeeeee...\n* ...Toasted Coconut, 2 Maple-Bacon and a Raspberry Lemonade. Fave? That Maple-Bacon.\n* They also serve coffee and misc bottles drinks\n\n...and before I knew it I scarfed the lot on the corner down the street. The Strip gets crowded, especially on Saturday and Sunday mornings, so plan to get there a little early for more flavors."
0,"Been here a couple times, never by choice. \n\nI can't really knock the service too badly as they don't seem any better or worse than any other chain on a busy night, but the food is just not very good. It's also pretty expensive for what you get. I always leave feeling like I would have been better off going somewhere else and either paying less for the same kind of food, or paying the same for way better food. I avoid this restaurant at all costs."
1,"I'm impressed, y'all! I'm a faithful Food Network cooking show watcher...Guy's never been my fav, but he's certainly jovial, entertaining, & creative...and that shows in his restaurant & menu.\n\nThere was a wait when we arrived for linner about 4pm...just roll on over to the secksy azz bar: full menu served, great drinks, & hot nice service! Our absolute fav was a cocktail with Jameson, mint, & other goodness....sooo refreshing & a taste bud pleaser! Get it!\n\nWe shared the Guy-talian fondue (or...Guy-Taliban as my autocorrect keeps saying...lol!). Absolutely ingenious! Long pretzel sticks wrapped in greasy yummy salami...dunk it in the cheese sauce (meh). The star? Besides the salami....the peppercinis! I'm not a big fan but these ones were superb: crunchy, spicy, perfect. \n\nWe also got the spicy wings...wings were meh, but the blue cheese wasabi sauce was like foreplay, y'all. Dip the crunchy fresh veggies on the side into it, slather the wings in it, don't waste it!\n\nI've NEVER observed SO many burgers leaving a kitchen, seriously. Look good, must be good. About 3/4 of the plates leaving the kitchen are burgers. \n\nI'd return next time I'm in Vegas! Kudos, Guy!"
0,"I think this Mexican restaurant/sports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss. \n\nWhen I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the immediate bar/room to the right of the entrance. If I remember accurately, there were about 3 TVs at the bar in there. The crowd here is a little bit older, but everyone looked like they were there to have a great time - MILFs, DILFs, and cougars included. \n\nI went up to the host stand where I waited for almost 5 minutes. Many servers walked by, but no one bothered to help, or tell me someone was on their way to seat me. Once I did sit down, I waited for about 15 minutes for my friend without being greeted by a server. Once she arrived, we waited another 20 minutes before my friend went to grab a waitress. The waitress apologized and told us she didn't realize she had our table as well. I've worked in a few restaurants through college - long enough to know that things sometimes get mixed up, but when you have a table waiting without food our drinks for 30+ minutes, you should probably go ask them if they need any help! \n\nThe food isn't worth talking about, so I won't."
0,"Horrible service for a horrible stay. Teens everywhere constantly screaming, bottled water costs is 3000% beyond reasonable, and rooms are mediocre. Stay someplace else to avoid the pain."
1,"It's a big padded lounge cinema boozer unusually named great pub thingy.\n\nThe Brass Monkey is Edinburgh's worst kept secret and provides a quirky place to grab a pint. The afore mentioned 'padded lounge cinema' thing is a room located to the rear of the bar where they show the odd alternative film classic and offer spacious, cushioned seating: basically a huge crash mat for you to mooch on, pint in hand and chums accompanying.\n\nAll great fun and a unique selling point."
1,"Top notch service. Carrie went above and beyond, staying with the delivery and our client until she was sure all the pieces were sent on their way to the show floor at CES. Great to work with, can't recommend enough."
1,This is my third visit and yet again it's like my first time.
1,"So happy to hear that Tropical Smoothie Cafe was opening a location near my office. I went in for lunch the other day and ordered the King Caesar wrap and Blimey Limey smoothie. The wrap was really good, though they would be better off with a different brand of tortillas (a little rubbery) - good amount of chicken, fresh lettuce, and tangy Caesar dressing. The smoothie was EXACTLY what I wanted - lots of citrus taste without being bitter. I added the weight management and energy supplements - they really worked. I was full (but not too full) the rest of the day and didn't have to endure the afternoon \""slow down\"" at work.\n\nI'll definitely be back for more"
1,SOLID.\n\nI have only been once but my pad see ew was delish! The noodles were cooked perfectly and I left full. My boyfriend is also a huge curry fan and he says that this place has probably the best in Champaign. We both love spicy food so this place was perfect! I'll be back!
1,"For the past three years, the official kickoff of Spring Training has been a trip to Goodyear Ballpark to see the Reds/Indians.  I don't live anywhere near this stadium, or know anyone from Cincinnati or Cleveland, but traditions don't necessarily have to make sense...\n\nThe stadium is something that Goldilocks would like - not too big, not too small.  It is just right.  Plenty of seating in both sun and shade, a variety of concessions and pretty good beer prices as compared to other stadiums.  Clean restrooms, too!  \n\nThere is a miniature baseball diamond with plastic balls & bats for kids (and adults who act like kids, ahem, me) to enjoy.  The ballpark even has its own mascot, Izzy, and skydivers to bring in the American and Arizona flags for opening weekend.  Pretty cool!\n\nSadly, this is the nicest stadium that nobody visits.  I have yet to see a crowded game.  I am guessing that if it were located anywhere but Goodyear (a bit of a drive!) it would be more popular.  \n\nStart your own Spring Training tradition and make it out to Goodyear!!"
0,This place was mediocre at best. We ordered a $200 bottle of wine and afterwards they tell us they are out of artichokes & short Ribs at 730PM on a saturday night!!!  We have eaten all over the world if this is your Flag ship restaurant get a LIFE boat!! Tuna Tacos!! Imagine el paso taco shells with spicy shit spread on it. Waste of $$$$!!! I should have chosen one of the other 4 star restaurants in Vegas!! \nWine list limited! Ugh
0,"Was not a fan of this buffet.  I had heard it wasn't good, and we only came because we were doing the Buffet of Buffets (Where you pay $35 for 24 hrs of access to any of 7 buffets) and we were gambling and decided we were wanted to take advantage and go to as many buffets as we could and we'd just go here.  Luckily it was a late meal, so we weren't starving but just wanted a little late night snack.  \n\nThere was nothing that was that great here.  It didn't even look all that great.  I did enjoy the cotton candy that they had when I left, though!"
1,"Our lunch/dinner was perfectly prepared and excellent!  Loved getting my burger medium, as requested.  Claudes enchilada dish was stuffed with fresh lobster and shrimp.  Our waitress was one of the best we have come across.  We'll likely ask for her next time we stop here.  Her name is \""Crystal\""."
1,"Went on a Saturday night at around 6pm...Service was fast and didn't have to wait. The ride was really fast but enough for me to get a good thrill. Purchased the deal through Groupon don't know if I would pay full price for it. Selfie's not allowed as they require you to lock up all your belongings before entering, but they do take pictures of you before and during the ride that you can purchase of course. Overall, it was fast but fun!"
1,"We have been coming here for over three years and while the service has been up and down, the food has stayed at a 4-star level. We have had just about everything on the menu between myself, my wife and our daughter, There have been some misses, but after reading some of the negative reviews before me, I wonder what standards these people are applying.. It is a chain burrito place, not Pampano in NY. Yes they still only take cash, but they have an ATM. Like any place you go to eat, you should give it two tries before condeming it. Oh and RIck S, thanks for the review, but I'm guessing you have turned more people off with teh update, so I hope you don't go any other places I like."
1,"Not many places are open after i get off work at 5:30am, but this place is!  Always used to pass it on my way to my old job but never thought about trying it. I ate there the other day and the food was amazing! The service there is also very good. The atmosphere is relaxing, the last thing i want to hear after a long night of work is loud music and yelling. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, the menu choices all sound delicious! \nMinus 1 star for price. I don't like paying 3 dollars for a glass of milk, when i can get a gallon for that price"
0,"When your taxi driver tells you he hasn't been here in years and wouldn't touch a thing in the place, and your room rate was astoundingly cheap when you booked, you start to wonder what the place is going to be like, and you hope your (low) expectations are not going to be met. Unfortunately, they will be. I took one look around here, interacted with a few scowling, unfriendly, unhelpful staff members, and decided I'd rather fork out the one night's cancellation and relocate to the Hilton across the street than spend two nights here. Three people who didn't told me how smart I was. You've been warned. It's depressing; filled with people gambling away their social security checks and chain smoking. Avoid."
0,"I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\n\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. \n\nI'm not really high on the \""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\"" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\""\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it."
0,I went to see the show since coco was the main star. I went into it thinking it was more of a cute story with a little nudity and I was shocked how much nudity it had. I read reviews before I bought tickets but I thought it was much more mellow. I have no interest in watching a woman strip down to nearly nothing. This was not the show to see if you are a heterosexual woman who doesn't even agree with strip clubs or sexually exploiting women. I hated the show and was extremely disappointed that I paid to see this show. It is an overpriced strip club. Don't waste time or money!
1,"After eating the kobe burger, don't know if I want to eat burger elsewhere.  Definitely a must go place if you are in Vegas and tired of all the \""buffet\"" places.  \n\nI had the kobe burger with portobello mushroom and it was just heavenly...moist and melts in your mouth goodness and not greasy at all!!!!  Sweet potato is a very good side."
0,"Totally disappointed at this place. I should've listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but noooo, I had to go and throw down two bills to prove to myself how much they sucked. \n\nThe decor was nothing to write home about. I think there was an overuse of bamboo in the place, the chairs were Ikea and the tables were just weirdly laid out. \n\nFirst of all, I couldn't understand the cutesy English the waitress was speaking. Each time she said something, we would pause for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, since we couldn't tell if she was asking us a question or making a statement. Then it'd be followed by, \""I'm sorry, what?\""\n\nWe ordered chilean sea bass in the black bean sauce, the crab ceviche, and some grilled beef thing. The ceviche was overwhelmingly tangy. I think it reshaped some of my fillings in my teeth. There was a lot of it though, even though the waitress told us that they were small portions. We next had the chilean sea bass which was not good at all. Again, portion was decent, but it was bland and not even hot. Finally, the meat came and although tender, it just wasn't as flavorful as I expected.\n\nFor being \""Nobu,\"" I did have high expectations. But DK and I evaluated it and said that even if this was a no-name restaurant that we just walked into, we still wouldn't have thought it was good. \n\nAnd by the next morning, we were telling people that it just \""sucked.\"" And I'm sticking with that. \n\nSo for those of you who speak Mandarin, you know that \""bu\"" means \""don't.\""  So this restaurant's name is a forewarning of a the answer you'll give when asked, \""So was it good?\"" or \""Is it worth going?\""\n\nNo. Bu."
0,"Overall a decent yet confusing experience...\nPros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things, including shuttle rides.\nCons: Extremely inconsistent room cleaning service! If you're staying for an extended period of time, they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is, they don't show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office, sometimes twice before it's cleaned. Also, someone in our  building had $1,900 stolen out of her drawer, and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check, but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn't stay here again...if you do, make sure that you use the safe provided in the room, and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself."
1,Great customer service.  Great flower arrangement  over all A++++++ I am telling everyone about them.  Awesome florist
1,"Nice hotel, and nice rooms, but we asked for a fountain view and we got instead a pool view but really nice and good service"
1,"This place is really neat.  Nice selection of books.  Eric, the owner, is very accommodating and helpful.  He offers great deals and has even given me a free beverage while I browse."
1,"A great hidden gem off Mill Ave!  This place has good veg/non veg healthy lunch options in a small court yard setting.  For ~$7 you will be full.  There popular chicken salad is delicious and you can't go wrong with any of their items.  I dig the free chips/salsa as well and the out door seating is good 9 out 12 months a year.  The owners and employees make this a warm friendly environment.  Styrofoam cups at a \""green\"" restaurant is what drops them from 5 to 4 stars."
0,"Visiting family from California and my Fiance and I decided to visit this dump...big mistake. Slots are tight the patrons that wander this shit hole remind of a Friday night at your typical Pittsburgh area wal mart (stained shirt/sweat-pants/velcro sneakers) since it was mid March and Pnc park wasn't open yet this was on our to do list. If you are from Pittsburgh and have a Gf/Bf you want to show around Pittsburgh don't bring them here!! Exp. If they have been to Vegas before they will look at you like you are crazy and say \"" So this is Pittsburgh?\"" Trust me take them to Penns Brewery or the Carnegie science center before you waste your time and money here"
1,I'm from Chicago and I felt like I'd stepped into a place back home. The lentil soup was delicious. Nicest people too and inside was well maintained.
0,"bland flavorless boiled meat.... i got teriyaki pork, yes the meat was tender and perfectly cook alas it was totally tasteless i got up to ask for more sauce and she handed me what i thought was vinaigrette but it was just the most watered down teriyaki sauce ever... it was almost clear... so then i asked for the sweet and sour sauce also almost flavorless. my friend asked for the brown rice they wer e out of it but didnt tell her until they brought her food to the table. she also got the vgitarian bowl and it was frozen mixed veggies, carrots broccoli and cauliflower with rice that was it for $7.00 and she said her veggies were still cold.. the pinapple on the plate was still green and totally unripe. the coconut icecream was good the grandmoms chocolate cake was still raw inside and seemed like very under cooked brownies.. i wouldnt waste your money here.. go somewhere else..."
0,"Memorial Day weekend 2013 - Aoki/Deadmau5\n\nPre-sale tickets male $100 / Female $40\n\nI had high hopes for Hakkasan. I went with my girlfriend and we were disappointed with everything except the music. Steve Aoki and Deadmau5 were the only thing that saved the night. Every single force outside of them was trying to ruin our night.  After an amazing memorial day weekend at Wet Republic with Tiesto and Marquee Day/Night club for Kaskade, Hakkasan was just... lacking.\n\nThe Bad:\n- We had pre-sale tickets, yet we were forced to wait 2 hours to get in. This is not an exaggeration, if you show up at 11:30, you're going to have a bad time. Once we were inside we saw that there was plenty of room to walk around and there was absolutely no reason for the wait. I've been to XS and Marquee with both table service and pre-sale tickets and I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get in. This was a terrible way to start off the night. When we finally did get in, Steve Aoki was just coming on at 1:30. Later after talking with a few other friends who got in through the guest line, we found out that they only had to pay $70 and they got in at the same time as us. Why did I spend $100 for my ticket to be let in at the same time?\n\n- The drinks were absolutely terrible and they cost $18+. At one point I just gave up and just ordered a screwdriver, biggest mistake. The OJ was not fresh, it was watered down minute maid garbage. For a club that promotes the best of the best, how do you fuck that up?\n\n- Water cost $9 and they give you an extremely small bottle. It was the end of the night, I finished my bottle of water but I needed more. After dropping $300 on drinks and closing out, I didn't feel like opening a new tab for another $9 bottle of water. I decided to fill up my bottle in the bathroom and the attendants start griefing me. I throw a dollar in their plate but they say they're going to get security. I've never seen a bathroom attendant freak out over water before in my life. I stopped, apologized, and threw away the bottle, but the attendant walks out with me and tells a security guard what went down. The security gave zero fucks about the water because I threw it away already and I just kept walking. Why are there 4 bathroom attendants in such a small space? Why do they care if you drink tap water from a bottle you already paid for? \n\n- The layout is completely wack. They close off the dance floor if it gets too crowded and then the people standing at the tables surrounding the dance floor completely block everyone's view. I have no problem with the dance floor being closed off, it's just where do you go once it's closed? Everything is tables everywhere. I actually felt bad for the tables not lined along the dance floor though. Their view was almost completely blocked by people standing on tables, people in between the isles, and pillars that are supporting the structure. The sound also does not carry very well to tables in the back. Be warned, those tables in the back dropped at least $10,000 and they had a blocked view of the stage and the sound was average at best. We tried to see if we could get a better view from the top floor, but the balcony is lined with tables as well. In the end they opened the dance floor back up for Deadmau5 and we were able to go down and watch. \n\n- Stairs and ramps everywhere. I saw 4 girls slip and fall throughout the night. Two of them were on the ramp going down to the dance floor and the other two slipped on stairs but caught themselves before completely falling. Be careful girls.\n\nThe Good:\n-The Talent. In the past 5 years I've seen Steve Aoki a total of 11 times. It's been amazing watching his music and his sets grow to what it is now. It was an epic set and he absolutely killed it. Deadmau5 was also absolutely amazing. He played a lot of new chill tracks for the first hour. Then he put on his gold mousey helm and started rockin with his old stuff. These guys were the only reason to be there.\n\n-The people there, everyone we met was really friendly and dressed to the 9s/10s.\n\n-The energy level of the crowd during Aoki's set. But you can get this at any of the top clubs in Vegas.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe amount of money spent by myself and everyone around us should be more than enough to fix the quality of the drinks, the lines, and the attitudes of the people working there. These are 100% management problems and can easily be corrected. I want to like Hakkasan, I enjoy the idea that there's an upscale club with my favorite artists playing every weekend. But I can't recommend this to anyone. I think we'll wait for a while before returning.\n\nSide note, we saw Tito Ortiz there. I checked out his Twitter account and it looks like he got the shaft as well with his table service. He waited for an hour, they charged him 40% gratuity, and they didn't let half of his crew in. If a guy like Tito gets bad service, what are you going to get? http://tinyurl.com/qgm5vn5"
0,"This place is a Noo No on my list. I will never go back..,,there are plenty of good places in Madison to try. \nTo start: there was Mexican music playing which was off putting considering I was there for Italian \nFood. The bread appeared to have been pressed in a panini  grill and was pretty unimpressive. My dish featured the \""homemade\"" sausage which was very tough and over cooked. The Tiramisu was flavorless and the wine was served in a glass that had dust all over the rim. For what you get.... The price of the food seems exorbitant.  I was confused about what the restaurant was about. There were tons of Mexican decorations and there were goldfish in a bowl at the hostess stand. \nThere was a distinct smell in the Restaurant too..... It smelled like an old Bar.\nMy suggestion would be to improve the ambiance. Beef up the smells to make the place feel more Italian. Serve real fresh bread in a good quality Olive oil. Include at least a small side salad with an entree."
0,"I have been here once before and found it to be pretentious and too pricey. I decided to return and give it one more chance armed with a Groupon this time. We figured if we use our coupon on a weeknight, how bad could it be. Well, it was pretty bad, because the place was closed. I looked on their website and on Yelp, and neither had correct information on their hours, in fact their own website does not even list hours of operation. Seriously? So, needless to say we drove all the way down there for nothing, and my freaking Groupon expired. \n\nHello, restaurant 101...tell the customers hours of operation on your website and/or have a message on the house phone. Neither for this place. Makes me wonder if it is still in business considering the way it looked inside, but who knows, because you cannot find out any accurate information anywhere. : ("
1,"I celebrated my wedding anniversary and by far the best food I've had in Vegas. The food had so much flavor. You will deff get your money's worth! We tried the shrimp cocktail it was amazing! The Cobia was so tasty   And my husband tried their chicken everything was good. We also went to the lounge right next door and it was fun good music, good drinks and beautiful view can't go wrong with that!"
1,This location is far preferable to the 'original'. Way better feel and flow of the building. Gotta love the panini and salad split :)
1,"I can't believe I'm giving a fast food, chicken strip joint five stars!\nI feel...I feel...good about it. \n\nI mean, come on, for just a few cents over six bucks you get \nThis box http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=orF-6gO8zteljlzAFq-Oqg\nFilled with some of the best fried chicken strips (5 strips) I've ever had http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=4wdej6Xl7xL5BL8w3dsEbA\nPlus fries and Texas toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=K8h0AZmAa9S5SC93VmpVjQ\nAnd Cole slaw and an amazing dipping sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=5OyWMqG6JdeX0AgfE8yNOw\nAnd this gigantic sweet tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=Vhnh9U2Q_Xh9N8aanZf6Zg\n\nIn all honesty, Raising Cane's does serve up some of the best tasting chicken strips I've ever had. And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect. \n\nPrices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly. \n\nMajors thanks to Dru \""DirtySmoke http://www.dirtysmokebbq.com/\"" C. for putting this place on my radar. You're right, Dru, it was amazing. \nCheck out Raising Cane's for yourself next time you're in Vegas. Trust me, it's worth leaving the strip for."
1,"I have only been to Chompies once.  The waitress recommended sharing a corned (spelled right, I guess) beef sandwich which she said would be big enough for two.  She wasn't kidding.  What truly impressed me was the beef.  It was not to salty and no pieces that you had to hod your napkin up and spit out.  Those are the reasons I never have this kind of sandwich.  Just great beef with the right kind of condiments in my opinion.  When we got the bill I was holding my breath.  What would it cost when the beef was in my opinion excellent.  My surprise at how reasonable the cost was.  Now I have to make a point of getting back there.  I like good potato pancakes.  If they are as good as what I had today, I'll be one happy camper!"
1,"Big portions, great food, crowded as all get out.\n\nTip:  Get a Total Rewards Platinum Card and skip the line...also thumb your nose at the people in the long line as you pass on through as though you are Thurston Howell playing through at the Pebble Beach Golf Course.\n\nGet the Fried Chicken Benedict or the Chicken and Waffles.  The Benedict is a lot of freakin food, and gets cold quick if you don't hoover it.  The Chicken and Waffles seems to hold together fairly well.  Don't think this is a classy joint...because it isn't.  This is a spit on the floor and curse at your friends kind of place...but it has great food.  Lots of freakin kids too.  Also...it is in the Quad, which means it is the best thing in the Quad....because the Quad is the 9th Circle of Hell."
0,So over priced
1,Just had them provide cupcakes for my wedding reception at the Palms. Incredibly responsive and easy to work with in the weeks leading up to the event. A little sad that I was unable to have a tasting beforehand (I live in California); but all the flavors we selected were delicious and they looked beautiful. Would definitely use them again.
0,"This is place is ri-goddamn-diculous. It wasn't so bad before when the hookah was cheaper, the portions were bigger, and the service was better; but now, I wouldn't even tell my rich friends to go here. Even if you don't mind the hidden costs that they don't tell you about until you need to pay, like the $4 tap water and the 15% automatic gratuity for the hookah boys that you have flag down with $100 bills, the service is downright horrible and just rude. By the time you get your waitress' attention for something, you're being kicked off your table to make room for the dance floor. \n\nI used to be a regular, but this experience ruined the establishment for me. It's as if they don't want your business. I know they won't be getting mine or the rest of my family's anymore!"
1,"The vets are typical in and out vets. What makes this place stand out and keeps me loyal are the friendly, helpful and all around awesome ladies at the reception counter. They are always sweet and helpful and welcoming. Making appointments is easy and they can usually see you same day. HIGHLY recommend. Only the best for my doggy!"
0,"My son had the fish tacos and the fish was delicious. The cabbage was bitter because it was from the part of the cabbage that you are not supposed to use - near the core. The rice was mushy, however the beans were okay. I had the chicken burro enchilada style and the chicken was boiled and dry. The enchilada sauce was bland and my rice was also mushy. The service was very slow. It took 30 minutes to get our food and there were only 5 other tables with customers. The chips and salsa were tasty and while waiting for our food I squeezed lime juice over the chips and added a little salt - that was tasty."
0,Was really looking forward to this since I love sandwiches and Tom C.  But man I was really disappointed.  Maybe it's cuz I've had some really really stellar sandwiches but these just felt like there was no love put into them.  I got one of the pork one and it was dry and thin.  Really a shame.
0,Sad excuse for a casino buffet.  \n\nHometown Buffet is better...\n \nEnough said.
0,"The only way to have a good time at Junkie is to get there early and snag a table, or be a hot 20 year old and butter up the bouncer... and then the bartender when you get inside.   If either of those doesn't work for you, then plan on waiting in a long line and getting terrible service at the bar.    Don't let my opening statement steer you away, there is potential for a good time here.  Of the handful of times I've subjected myself to the low scale, high priced, barely 20 something bar, I've had fun twice.   The key both of those times was getting a table!! The waitress counts on you for her tips, so she will be attentive and she has \""pull\"" with the bartender so you can get your drinks way quicker.   Every time I've had to go to the bar, I've been completely ignored. Now, I'm no supermodel, but I'm not too sore on the eyes either... not even my D cups worked!  At our last visit we actually ordered some appetizers, they were just okay, but exactly what I would expect from bar food.  I struggle with my rating because I would give Junkie a 3 for the two times I had a good experience, but 1.5 for the others.  I guess that tells me that my fellow yelpers have done us solid with a current rating of 2.5."
1,"Heck yeah!  The Lodge is my favorite bar in Old Town Scottsdale. It's a guaranteed fact that my friends and I will end up here on a night out on the town.  \n\nFood:  My gal pals just love the nachos.  My self-proclaimed \""nacho expert\"" pal claims that they are \""absolutely the best nachos in town\"".  I prefer the fired cheese curds (and I swear they help cure hangovers if you have them for breakfast/brunch)  \n\nAtmosphere:  Like a cozy log cabin in northern Wisconsin, this bar has a friendly local atmosphere.  Could it be the carved grizzly on the front porch?  Cozy fireplace? Antlers on the wall?  I find that other Midwestern folk flock to this joint, so you can pretty much guarantee that the clientele will be friendly.  I like that :- )\n\nStaff:  The doormen are seriously gentlemen.  They remember regulars and are practical and reasonable if patrons act unfavorable.  The bartenders are stinkin' awesome!  I may sound biased, but my 2 favorite bartenders are from the Midwest--I personally think they just add to the terrific Midwestern atmosphere!  \n\nWeather it's for a wild bachelorette party or a tame happy hour with coworkers, the Lodge is sure to please!!"
1,The chicken strips were really good but the sauce they provide to dip sorta sucked. Maybe I can try it again next time I'm in Vegas...
1,Now they have ice cream! \n\nThey remind me of the candy store you use to have when you were younger. \n\nThey have snapples for 1.50 and can's of soda's and bottles of water for 75 cents. Now they have the ice cream cooler next to the drinks for prices $1.00 to 1.50. \n\n It's a great snack to eat when your waiting for your food
0,"Scheduling appointments sucks. Each person answering the phone will say different things.

1,"This place is basically the Cheesecake factory...in Vegas! (Which makes a lot of sense since it's owned by the same people as noted on the menu).\n\nBut, don't be sad that it's a chain...because it's pretty dang good and quite a value for a Vegas casino!\n\n---FOOD---\nThis place has a HUGE variety of options on the menu. Here's what we got: \n\n1) Ahi Tuna Burger, $15ish\n- It was HUGE!!! The tuna was seared perfectly well and coated in a spicy grounded pepper mix that paired really well with the aioli they served. My favorite touch to this burger was the thick whole-grilled red onion slice. \n\nThe burger also comes with fries, but you can opt. for a different side: I opted for the steamed brocolli that is NOT slathered in butter (thank goodness) -- they steam whole heads of brocolli for you. How unique. Ha. \n\n2) Polynesian Salad, $14ish\n- VERY huge and fresh tasting. Sweet, tangy sauce over greens with chicken slices and lots of other excitement I can't recall..\n- Loved how they top the salad off with whole pieces of fried wonton instead of mixing in bits and pieces into the salad. It's great because it gives u the option of NOT eating the friedness (cuz...u know...it would be healthier that way) and makes the presentation look cooler simultaneously!\n\n3) Sunday Night Pasta, $17ish\n- VERY VERY huge! Meaty! Very savory! My friend could only eat 1/3! =P\n\n4) CREME BRULEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, $7.50ish -- GET THIS!!!\n- For this price, you get TWO huge servings of a vanilla and chocolate delicacy with a waloop of whipped cream that easily satisfied 3 people!!! SO GOOD!!!!\n\n---SERVICE---\nFriendly, attentive, efficient. We didn't have to wait at all for a seat (Friday night, too!). \n\n---AMBIANCE---\nThe place is huge! And the decor is pretty much...Cheesecake factory. I love how it's so casual, yet still elicits an elegant feeling. \n\n---VALUE---\nFor a restaurant in the middle of one of Vegas' most popular casinos, it's definitely a winner!"
0,I'd give it a zero if I could. This place is weak as fuck. Mexican food? Please. I'd rather go to Taco Bell. There's a taco truck down the road that you're better off spending your money on.
0,Arrived to sit down with a good crowd & ambiance. Soon a stinky bar tender assisted with our order.\nHis body oder was so offensive that it made me gag... We didn't want him to come near us. Couldn't even enjoy our meal. Came here on a Monday evening to watch a football game.

1,"I was lucky enough to get tickets for the John Williams/Steven Spielberg concert here not long ago.  It was my first visit to Symphony Hall since it underwent an extensive multi million dollar renovation years ago.  It was also my first time seeing the Phoenix Symphony in action since I was a kid.\n\nWhat. A. Show.\n\nThe renovated building looks fantastic and modern with tremendous acoustics, comfortable seating, and great site lines.  The Symphony rose to the occasion playing John Williams' greatest hits with near perfection and even Spielberg was taken aback.  An amazing experience I'll never forget.\n\nThe venue seats about 2,500 so it's just a bit smaller than Gammage Auditorium in Tempe, but has a much more intimate and luxurious feel.  Great place to come to catch the Symphony, a play, ballet, or lecture.  Wonderful home base for Phoenix's performing arts scene."
1,I like the prices on the supplements I use here.  The staff is knowlegeable and not pushy.  I followed their recommendations for supplement changes when I hit a plateau in my training and it worked like a charm.
1,"I was at Fired Pie today for a Chandler Chamber of Commerce event. This place is awesome. Their food is fabulous, and fast and the price is extremely reasonable. I shared the field greens salad with grilled veggies and the pesto chicken pizza. Both were wonderful. Considering they had over 50 people arrive at the same time, I was blown away at how efficient they were and how good everything came out. Keep up the awesome work!"
0,"Disappointing at best- had fresh spring rolls, came wrapped in crepe not rice paper as advertised on menu- had pad Thai- kinda a big glob of noodles with a a few slices of carrot and green onion and no peanut garnish- nota keeper!!"
0,"Really long waiting, mediocre food, below average and sometimes rude waiting staff. I have had buffets in multiple places in Vegas (Aria, Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's Palace) and Wynn is worse by orders of magnitude. After waiting in line for an hour and a half, the first thing our hostess told us was that we had 2 hours to finish. I felt welcome right then! After that, the waiter, who only had to bring us drinks, brought us water in the beginning and did not come back even when we asked him to. And then one of the busing guys seemingly jokingly did an act with couple other staff members to kick out folks sitting on the table next to us since they only had 8 minutes left for their 2 hours - the effect was that they left, and the rest in the room were left with a bad taste. And the food was nothing to write home about. If you're in Vegas, you have so many options that this buffet is certainly worth skipping. This is my first review on yelp. I was so annoyed with the whole buffet experience at Wynn that I registered with yelp and wrote the review sitting at the table!"
1,"East Valley vapes get 5 stars for me in juice selection,  hardware and costumer service. I'm always happy to support local shops and I will definitely come back here. Kudos to the owner Kevin for great customer service."
1,Amazing deal for 39.99 per person inc. drinks for an unlimited buffet. 12 different cuisines plus over 3 dozen desserts. Rated 8.5 out of 10 for our party of 4. This is not your parents buffet. This is awesome!
0,"Best place in Charlotte for comics, hands down. Sadly, not the best place to go for a friendly staff. Condescending tones and mockery of things I asked for/was inquiring about are not a good way to get return business! :( I'll buy online before I go in here again."
1,Wonderful experience.  Everyone raved about their food and rightly so.  I had the seared ahi tuna with wasabi aioli and was soooo sad when I was down to my last bite.  It was a little expensive for two items on the plate but it was delicious.
0,"I used to go to Sam Woo when it first opened and always like the bbq pork fried rice and the sliced bbq pork which were always good.  I had to give the place a break after trying other dishes that weren't so great, and also because they have been closed several times by the health department. I've gone there when they had a B rating, and turned around and walked out.  Keep your eye on them, I think you can find the latest restaurant ratings in the RJ."
0,"I am gonna do a new review bc my initial one was removed bc yelp said my complaint was an \""employment issue\"". I will start out by saying I was not an employee. I am in the healthcare field. I would say I have to give Satya a thumbs down. My reasons:\n\n1 Poor Customer Service\n2 Inconsistence with stylists. They seem to have a high turnover and I like to use the same girl each visit and in my case, I had different stylists at each visit. \nI tried contacting management via email and phone on several occasions with no resolution. Maybe you will have better luck but this is not your typical Aveda experience."
0,This place deserves nothing. I got house chicken and chicken fried rice. When I got home to mix the two I bit into it and found a thick sharp plastic!!!!! I didn't really care because I didn't swallow it no harm whatever. Called them to let them know. Or see if they can fix the problem for me because we are starving and find this crap in our food. Thinking they give us a new meal and a refund on the inconvenience and  apologize for the object they yelled at me! They yelled at me. Are you kidding me? told me if I wanted new food they wanted the old food in full. they asked me how much of it I ate. Making it seem like there doing me a favor. Wth no. I found a price of plastic that could've had me choke! I had to stop my meal to argue with these guys on the food for 20 minutes. To find out there's no way out of this. I hung up because I didn't care enough to argue in circles. But hey if you want A HUGE SHARP object in your food that the restaurant will blame you for then hey this is the place to go!!!
1,"Come here on a Groupon and had no issues.\nI was there late but called ahead and made reservations for a Wednesday night at 9pm.\nNormally they stop serving from the full menu but they told me they would honor it and they did!\n\nI ordered the Peach Puzz Fizz, delicious! My date ordered Death in the Afternoon. Phew It was strong, but he really liked it.\n\nFor entrees we ordered the Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection and was melt in your mouth delicious. The Spicy Beer Braised Shrimp was unlike anything I have had before. Spicy but not overpowering, the sauce tasted amazing when the bread that accompanied the dish was dunked in it.  Just fantastic.\n\nThen the best part came, the smores. Who doesn't love them? \nIt was the prefect ending to an almost perfect restaurant experience. \n\nI say almost because the only minor incident I had was when the waitress saw my drink at half full, she asked if I wanted another one. I said no and she walked off with my class! Maybe she thought I was done? Anyways when she came back i explained to her I wasn't done and she quickly apologized and brought me another one on her.\n\nShe was very kind and gracious. This is my new favorite place!\nCan't wait to come back Groupon or not"
1,"Karla was our server today, she was right on time w/ her greeting us and was very nice! She was of course wearing green on st. Pattys day and suggested something new which most servers do not.. I tried eggs Benny! Loved it. Thank you Karla, see ya soon"
0,"I kind of experienced some reverse racism here.. and it really pissed me off... yeah, I'm white.. doesn't mean I don't crave some great soul food once in a while.. thought the whole point of the golden rule was to leave your money on the table.. as I'm leaving.. dude asks me if i'm going to pay? tld him money was on the table...did'nt question any of the african american folk...  really ticked me off.. plus, cash only, real limited menu, no waffles, corn on the cob, mashed, really limited sides..and kind of mediocre IMO.. Staceys and lolos kick its ass... (Shrug)"
1,"Another installment of the \""craft beer/craft food\"" restaurant model, but I'm ok with this model.\n\nIt's a large space, which is great.  \n\nOrdered the pretzel bites and provolone fondue.  OH. MY. GOD.  They're incredible.\n\nAlso had their fried chicken which was fantastic (though, a bit greasy.  Could have rested a little more, nbd).\n\nAnd any place that serves tall cans of PBR to go with my food, is a great place to me.\n\nAlso, if you're jonesing for a snack, you can get some of their food to go and stroll about the casino with it.\n\nLooking forward to going back!"
1,"I want to give this 5 stars however I can't based on the service. \n\nThe food was great. I ordered off the Pho menu. I ordered the vietnamese egg rolls, and soup. Both were delicious. I loved the pho, it was not greasy and had a great flavor. The people I went with ate the more traditional food which they said was very good. \nIt's great for a late night bite to eat. \n\nThe service was lacking. We ordered, but had to repeat ourselves twice to make sure she heard us. Then they switched waiters on us but said nothing, then it seemed like we watied forever for our bill, and then was told that someone else would check us out. That person we never saw, then I handed it to another waiter walking by who took it and checked us out after another 10 minute wait. It was just a really long time to wait and pay. The people on the way out smiled and were friendly but the wait staff were not."
1,"Dave Mueller's very tiny spot is tucked away on a side street in Myers Park.  Voted 2009 Critic's Pick Creative Loafing for BEST HAMBURGER.  Last month I ran into Dave at a local chili cook off in Dilworth.  He won both critic's and judge's choice...and deserved it!!  This reminded me to try his little hole in the wall neighborhood grill.  There's not much seating so plan to eat outside or get it to go.  I took Dave's recommendation (he's usually always working) on what to order.  He suggested the patty melt.  Cooked perfectly...it was delicious...and a lot of food!  The menu is pretty simple....mostly burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, and a couple salads.   And great service to top it off.  Check it out and when you do, tell him that Heidi from Keller Williams Southpark sent you!\n\nP.S.  Need some good chili for the cold weather?  Don't forget he won awards for it!  And the homemade soups look great too!"
1,"I have been here many times...and the table service has always sucked. Its kinda something you expect when you come here. Like that one friend that you still go out with even thought they always do something stupid. What I would suggest when you go there is try to sit at the sushi bar, but even then it can be really slow. Even if you are the only ones there. Or it just opened.Or pretty much for any reason..you are going to wait. But when you get it, it's delicious and you don't care anymore, and you go back. and bring people. and then go online and yelp about it. yum, What I get is now all I get, I know I should try to get other stuff..but these are just so good: \nthe no name handroll, the stacie cut roll (get 2 even),the moon roll, and the green mussels and a side of ponzu with it all. Dayum."
1,Visiting Pittsburgh for my niece's graduation and stopped here for a quick smoke. Very nice and the owner Rachel is very friendly and knowledgable of cigar brands. I'll definitely be back!
0,"I thought they did a good job until I went to Foothills Sports Medicine.  I started getting a weird feeling when I kept getting calls to make visits when I didn't even need treatment anymore.  I went there again for a non injury but a soreness and somewhat trauma I've had for a while.  When I stopped going, I got calls again to come in.  My insurance isn't great and they knew that.  The worst part is the their billing, it's confusing and they don't even understand it."
1,"This place is great. Saves me the headache of having to go to seafood city for some quick essentials. The store is always clean and organized and has a friendly atmosphere. The two cashiers I've seen have always been very polite to everyone I've seen walk in.  I briefly talked to the owner the week of their opening and he's a real friendly guy.  Their selection is a bit limited for now, but I'm sure it's bound to expand."
0,"Understaffed, slow, long wait lines.\n\nPrice may be cheaper than other locations.\n\nThis is an off-site rental location. In order to get to this office, you have to take one bus from the airport and then switch to another mini bus. The extra ride is approx 5 mins more, but the wait times at this rental location are just draining."
1,"I loved the bargain rack, I got every Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz book for a dollar each.  They also comic books and records and a lot of books that you might not find at Barnes and Nobles or Borders."
1,"Was stoked to see this little coffee shop while wandering PHX during a long layover.  The menu boards in the back showed Aeropress, Hario V60, Clever, and Chemex at MKT price, which was a definite surprise to se ein an airport.\n\nI ordered an Aeropress.  I was way too travel logged to really care about looking over their roasts, so went with the barista recommended Providencia.  Nice to see them doing an inverted brew on a gram scale, pre-moistening the paper filter, weighing out the water, and timing.  I didn't see them pre-warm the Aeropress, nor did they bloom the coffee.  Still, the coffee was solid, with a great nose (though maybe any coffee would have done the trick at that point in my travels), and worth the $3.25 market price.\n\nI'm a little surprised to see most of those brewing techniques in a high-traffic, speed oriented, environment like an airport.  My coffee definitely took a while (as expected), but I can't imagine what this place must be like when slammed (I was the only customer at 7 PM on a Sunday evening).\n\nRad to have this option in an airport environment, and it's a shame I didn't have the time/energy to explore their roasts.  \n\nDefinitely worth the jaunt to Terminal 4 if you've got a layover in PHX . ."
0,"i will never understand this place.  the ice cream is horrible and yet there is a ready supply of college kids waiting to eat it.  the gimmick of watching someone add the bling to your ice cream seems to overshadow the actual taste of the end result.  i guess if you add enough accessories nobody will notice that the binding agent is worse than generic ice cream served in the dormitory cafeterias.  oh, i just figured it out, i get it now."
0,"If you like beige, off-white, oyster, etc.  then you're just going to love the changes Restoration Hardware have done to their stores.  UGH!\n\nI know the human eye can discern several shades of gray, but this is ridiculous!"
1,"burger joint. they know how to cook a good burger, been there a number of times."
1,"My first time there and it was a pleasant change . The food , ambience and service was great. \n\nHad the Chicken Po Boy sandwich , it had  great flavor and taste. \n\nFollowed up with a chocolate banana crepe which was pretty good. A little dry but Nutella makes things taste better."
1,"I stayed at the Palmoar and found this hidden gem.  Coffee was so delicious and I really enjoyed my breakfast.  I came here each morning during my stay.\n\nThe staff is friendly and they offer military discount.  I love the general vibe, but was disappointed when I discovered it is a chain.  I must say I scout for \""traditional\"" coffee spots, one of a kind type of establishments; however, the coffee is good, and the ambience is cool, so if you are in the area and looking for a good place to have a cup of coffee, don't pass this place up."
0,"It's a pool hall and nothing more, just a very large one with music that doesn't destroy your ear drums with sexy service. The drinks are well prepared but have no real zing and if you order food... it's at your own peril. The food, if I can call it such a thing, is your typical bar food, nachos, quesadillas and wings. As with most bar food, you need to be properly alcoholised in order to mildly enjoy it. It's drunk food, drunk enough to consume anything. \n\nThe pool tables are well maintained, so are the sticks (from what I saw). The place is group-ready but not my cup of tea. It was perfect for our last minute happy hour party but it's a dive and I say dive with its negative connotation."
1,"Tried this place out for the first time food was awesome! I would definitely go back the only let down was the service was kind of crummy, there server did not seem like she wanted to be there... maybe it was an off night or something"
1,"Great food! Great atmosphere! Went on a Saturday... The live music was a tad loud for my taste but I had a good time here with friends. Hands down, get the pretzels with cheese fondue. Delicious appetizer!!! I got the bbq bacon burger. I've had many bbq bacon burgers in my time and this surpassed them all. It was massive! And where a regular burger has a piece or two of bacon, this was stacked! Very flavorful. My only complaint is I got my water refilled once the whole time I was there... I had to steal my hubby's water. Otherwise would have had 5 stars! I'll definitely come back sometime."
1,"Very informative, great prices, very thoughtful and friendly. Before you get ripped-off for a new violin visit this place.\nI am saving my money for when is time to upgrade my 10 year-old violin's, will definitively buy one there."
0,Don't come here if you're in a time crunch. And $25 for a mediocre-at-best sandwich and coke? I don't care if it is sit down. No thanks. Skip this place.
1,"PINBALL HEAVEN!!\n\nThis is THE place to fall in love with pinball machines for the first time or all over again!\n\nTHE GOOD\nAround 200 pinballs and tons of classic arcade games, most of them in fantastic condition, ready to be played and loved. Tim and his buddies keep them in top shape, bumpers and flippers are snappy and crisp. They also have some rare stuff in there that you won't see anywhere else.\nPlus they donate TONS of MONEY to CHARITY, very cool!\n\nTHE BAD\nThe building itself is an ugly commercial box and some of the corners inside are filled with pinball and arcade scraps and junk. Don't let small kids run around there (you shouldn't do that anyway).\n\nTHE UGLY\nThis place is out in the middle of nowhere, if you come by cab it might take quite a while to get a cab back to civilization (use the 7-11 to hang out or have them call a cab, that seems to work better, see below).\n\nMAKE IT BETTER\nThere is a used videogame store right next to it which carries a lot of games for older systems (incl. Nintendo etc.). Also a 7-11 at the corner from which you can call cabs and where you can get cheap drinks/food."
0,Just dreadful.
0,"The epitome of a dive bar! Not necessarily in a bad way, but only giving out two stars from my experience earlier this week. For starters, it was totally dead but took the one lone lady bartender a good five minutes to notice I'd walked in- because she was so engrossed in conversation with a patron. I guess it could be worse.\n\nThere's a large sunken seating area for watching games, and this bar has DirecTV- a plus in some ways, but considering that's what I have at home, this isn't a place to go to watch a game that's on the NBA or NFL package, they don't have that here from what the bartender told me.\n\nThey do have a food menu, and a Yelp check in offer saying you get a free drink with a food purchase- but the menu looked a little overpriced for bar food and I did not choose to try it at this time.\nLots of built-in poker machines built into the counter, most of the TVs are a little bit of an older style, signs up said they have karaoke on Thursdays but when I went it was completely dead- maybe I need to come back for those wings everyone's talking about.\n\nNot sure when happy hour is- think I sign said their late one was 2AM to 5AM, but there's another one that ended at 5PM or 6PM. With normal pricing, our two small draft beers (Blue Moon and Shiner) were $8."
1,"Always stop here for a bag each of candy-shelled chocolate-covered peanuts and chocolate-covered almonds from the bulk section.  Love the organic Mountain Fresh and Brown Cow yogurts.  As for the produce I buy here, I must first say that I triple-, sometimes quadruple-inspect my options before I purchase at any grocery I shop at, and I've only had to complain about the strawberries here at Sunflower.  All other fruits and the veggies were fine.  Wish I could say the same about the other farmer's market whose name rhymes with snouts...\n\nDon't know if this place still sells Berto's gelato and Laloo's goat milk ice cream as it's been close to a year since I last purchased, but you must check these items out as they taste out-of-this-world!  The prices are also very wallet-friendly compared to AJ's, but really, that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
1,"Came in for check engine light and they checked it out for free and referred me to somewhere that could help, then also cleaned my front headlights and buffed them for free!"
1,"Oh Chipotle, I love you so much.\n\nMy husband and I came here Sunday to grab a quick lunch. We usually get the salad bowls, however, we decided to split the burrito.\n\nSteak, rice, blackbeans, cheese, salsa, corn, and guac (yes, it is extra but so worth it!). The burrito was HUGE. I was completely full after eating half of it. So glad we split. \n\nLove coming here because of the fresh ingredients and options. Anyone that is doing the Whole 30 diet (God bless you), this place is heaven. The carnitas meat is Whole 30 approved and so is the lettuce, pico, corn, and guac!"
1,"This was an enjoyable experience.  Tasted good and was priced decently.\n\nI had a bbq lamb sandwich.  Which is something I had never heard of.  It was essentially a pulled pork sandwich, but with lamb.  The sauce was good.  The bun was soft without being mushy.  The meat was tender.  The fries were really delicious; they had that sort of crumbly coating on them.  With the soda I think it was 7 or 8 bucks.\n\nEveryone else in the party had gyros which they all seemed to like.\n\nRestaurant was clean and the staff was friendly."
1,"I'm very cautious walking into \""big box\"" retail centers because I don't want to be sold on something I don't need. I came her a few weeks ago because I ran over a nail and needed a simple plug to repair the small leak. One of their managers greeted me and looked at my tire right away. After his inspection he told me that my tire is too old and the tread was cracking away from the tire. He suggested I replace the tire because it was too worn and fixing it wouldn't be worth it. I quickly declined his offer because I thought he was just trying to make a sale and I left. After doing some research and speaking with other wheel and tire technicians they all agreed that the tire was too worn to be fixed. I found a small tire shop to plug the hole and I went on my way. The very next day my tire was flat again and the slow leak wasn't fixed. I was warned that this might happen due to the condition for the tire. So I went back to the same Discount Tire and bought two new tires. I spoke with the same manager and apologized for being stubborn and not taking his advice. He ended up giving me the same deal as before and the service was really fast. I'm now fully confident with the honesty and service at this location. I will defiantly be coming back.........Thanks Mike!"
1,"This is my go-to place when I need to get work done but don't feel like working at home.  The staff here is as sweet as you can get; they are always super welcoming, willing to answer questions, and never rush you when you're trying to decide what to pick from their menu.  Speaking of the menu, the coffee is delicious (try a soy au lait on an autumn day) and they make some really excellent sandwiches.  As a bonus, they consistently play 80s and 90s music (for some reason, Nickelback really helps with productivity)."
1,"This is one of my favorite lunch places.  They have a WONDERFUL lunch special which includes one slice of pizza and a salad for an affordable price.  They have good service during lunch and you can sit inside or on the patio, depending on the weather.  Also, ask what the special slice of the day is...  it is very hit or miss.  But, sometimes you can find a gem!!!"
1,"I prefer the off-strip younger resorts.  I typically choose to stay at Hard Rock, Rio, or Palms.  They are a bit more hip, not crowded with hover-rounds, and offer kick-ass pools.  The room was updated and nice.  The dealers were friendly, and the on-site food was ok."
1,Good staff and nurses. Always clean and always helpful with any questions I've had.
1,Amazing coffee & the energy that comes out of the coffee shack makes my day!

0,"After dinner, we decided to put the kid in bed (along with his grandmother) and go out and do some fun stuff.  I remember the bowling place (I think it was TEN park lane or something) we went to last Thanksgiving, but when we arrived it looked like Cam Newton was there signing autographs.  The place was mobbed.\n\nSo we decided to look for another bowling alley, and this place came up.  The nice thing was when we arrived, it wasn't crowded like the other place was.  There was 10 or us, so we needed 2 lanes.\n\nNow here is the interesting thing.  The pricing.  I know it was Saturday night, but I thought it was somewhat pricey.  For $20 PP, you got 2 hours bowling, and shoes- that was it!  No food, no drinks, no massages in the back, no nothing extra!  To me, that was pricey.  I would only expect that at a boutique bowling alley- but cmon, this was an AMF.\n\nwe got set up in lanes 6-7, which kind of sucked- as we didn't get two lanes together (2 separate returns- 5-6 are together, and 7-8 were).  I mean we were next to each other, well shit- I guess you have to be there to understand what I am talking about.\n\nYou could choose theming on your machines, that was interesting.  We kept ours on medieval theming.  It was then time to bowl.  Finding the oil patterns were tough here.  In fact- it was the worst bowling I have done in years (I am not saying that either to be funny- it really was).  I couldn't blow the pins over to get a 100.  It was embarrassing.  In fact, it was so bad, I needed a drink.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, I noticed when other members in our group were gone, they were gone for a while.  I was not sure why.  When I went to get a drink, I noticed why.  The bar area was tended by one person- but he wasn't swamped.  This lady in front of me ordered a huge drink that looked like a urinal cake with pineapples and a maraschino cherry.  6 minutes later, I just wanted a damn pitcher of Bud Light.\n\nI couldn't wait any longer.  At this point, I didn't even want a glass- I was ready to drink the pitcher on its own.  When I had my first sip- I damn near spit it out.  The Bud Light really did taste like Bud Shite.  And you know the worst part?  I ended up drinking the whole pitcher- I knew it would not get any better.  \n\nThat night was one of those instances that thankfully I was with wonderful company to keep my mind off the negatives- because when I bowl badly and drink bad beer and high prices, that makes for an angry Tom.  Thankfully the place was clean.  I will give it 2.5 stars."
0,"Just saw Jack Johnson.  Great performance!   \n\nPaid $5 for a flat coke(in a plastic bottle) and then was not allowed to leave with it after the concert - really don't know why I still had it with me, but really?\n\nOK venue - OK sound - staff sucks.  Not the smartest bunch of folks - Guess they don't care who they hire."
0,"I've been going to cafe rio for a few years. Tonight I went and ordered a pork quesadilla with extra meat for a first time. I had ordered it to go and when I got home to open it I was very disappointed. They put meat inside, but seemed to have no cheese so the  tortillas didn't stick together and meat fell out everywhere. They never cut it into pieces so I had to use a knife and fork to cut the whole thing apart. It looked so unappetizing and looked like an open face taco, not a quesadilla. Very disappointed they would serve this."
1,This is a fun family restaurant I will say the inside is quite old I was disappointed with the grease that was used for the to deep fry oil needed to be changed the coleslaw was not that great but everything else was very good the staff is young but friendly and we went on a Friday evening and it was not that busy overall this is a fun Country Western restaurant.
0,"I called early this morning to get an appointment today for my dog to be washed & groomed. I got him there a little early and went over the paperwork with \""Tiff.\"" I specifically asked her, and was charged for, the medicated shampoo because my dog has allergies. More on that later. She told me that he'd be ready before 5. \n\nI called at 4:40 and she said he was not done & that she would call me a little after 5. Well, we had another errand so we thought we'd just go do that & then go pick him up without waiting for her call. When we got there at 5, he still hadn't even been started yet!!! Why would they make an appointment for me at 12:30 knowing that they were overbooked and slammin' busy????? So we waited. \n\nWhen he came out he tail was still not cut short enough and there were numerous places that had fur sticking out that should have been cut. His eyebrows are totally uneven and now I have to trim him myself. \n\nAND NOW FOR THE WORST PART.... He came out smelling of some horrible, nauseating spray!!! I specifically told her that he had allergies & that's why I requested the allergy shampoo. Doesn't anybody listen??? My poor dog has been rubbing his face on the carpet all night and now needs another bath. I will never use this place again. 5 hours is way too long for a shampoo & groom!!! Thanks for nothing \""Tiff!!\"""
0,"Absolutely go here if you want to be belittled and embarrassed. The male employee that we had the unfortunate luck of speaking with was so rude. We walked in to check in and he was already in a bad mood. \n\nHe spoke down to us the whole time. He looked up our number and had an attitude about asking our names. He made us feel embarrassed to even be in the place. There were a couple of other customers waiting, who I hope walked out as we did. \n\nWe ended up going somewhere else and were treated much better and got cheaper haircuts that we love. I hope this location takes a closer look at the attitudes of their employees and decides to revamp their employment options."
1,"This is the best work out plan for me. i work Monday through Friday and to have a boot camp i can do after work on my own schedule in my own apartment complex is amazing. the work out kicks my butt every time and now that it's cold outside, this the the reason i get out of the house and start working out. Keep up the great work Impact!"
1,"MGM Grand has a sign out front that says \""The City of Entertainment\"". MGM Grand is more like \""The City of Restaurants\"". There are so many good choices in this resort that it is very hard to choose which upscale place you'd like to dine. Well, look no further. \n\nCraftsteak is easily accessible if you come from the Valet or the parking garage. If you walked in the front door of the MGM Grand by the strip, you have a long hike to get here. \n\nThe food is excellent, the portion sizes are great and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. \n\nMy previous three journeys into the Craftsteak, I ordered the 16oz Skirt Steak. Not the Wagyu version, the base version. Pretty much, if you were ordering cars at a steak house......you'd have your choice between the BMW 3-Series or the Toyota Camry. I always picked the Toyota. Why? Well, the skirt steak that they served at $36/16oz was sufficient and delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems based on their menus online that they only have the Wagyu kobe skirt steak now at a hefty $69/12oz. If you want a BMW 3-Series steak, knock yourself out. \n\nThe truffled mac and cheese and the other sides here are excellent, but unnecessary.  You only need the steak here because if you order lots of sides, you'll be wasting lots of food.\n\nAll in all the decor is nice, and the service is excellent which makes Craftsteak a perfect place for a quiet dinner.  I'll recommend this place to everybody I meet who stays at MGM Grand, however, I'll go across the street to Stripsteak @ Mandalay Bay for my favorite cut of skirt steak."
0,"The first time I went there, they cancelled my appointment due to a \""family emergency\"" which happens sometimes, but then they rescheduled me without speaking to me, and then wanted to tell me that they have a cancellation policy, which they wanted me to know about  because I was cancelling (the appointment I did NOT make) not very customer service oriented, nor thinking properly.\nHowever, a friend of mine had gone the same day they cancelled me and said it was super quick, so I tried again.  Brought my paper in for a free wax of some sort as I booked online.  I told the gal who checked me in that I was new, and also the wax technician, both acknowledged I was new, and verified my residency.  The tech was very nice and efficient, her name was Joy.  If I could stand togo ere again, I would like her to do repeat business.  When I went to check out, the girl named Darian told me that the two services that I booked were not covered under any discount for new people.  I asked her what that new client service would be and she told me waxing of lip or eyebrow.  And I told her that I would have liked to get one of those services, and could I get it free next time I came in, as no one told me about which services were restricted.  She said, no, but that she could \""give me half off\"" my next service when I came in.  I tried several times to get it through to her that I wanted some sort of conciliation as no one told me that I couldn't get something for free.  She just looked at me.  I told her that I wanted to cancel the next appointment that I made, and she said \""okay\"" in a more cheerful tone.  I told her that I didn't think that her customer service was that great, and she said (again in a condescending tone) \"" sorry, have a good night\"".  I later called and asked for a manager, and had to speak to Miss Darian again, as she told me that there was no manager on duty.  She then started to tell me that there is no such thing online as a \""Totally Free Visit\"" when I told her that this was not what I was upset about, she interrupted me to talk over me about how that was not realistic, nor their policy.  I told Darian that I wasn't asking for that and that she was being rude for interrupting, she said \""obviously I can not help you with this issue\"" I told her that she was again being rude and I hung up.  But not before I told her that I would post online, which she said to go ahead and do. I did and also contacted the store's online help desk. THREE DAYS LATER a manager called me and agreed that I should have gotten an under arm wax for free and that it was their policy to give that as one of their free services to new people. When I told her that I couldn't stomach going to the Tempe Marketplace location anymore, due to Darian.  The manager apologized and set me up at the Camelback location.  This was fine, I appreciate apologies, but I don't understand why they would keep someone like that in their employ unless they just don't care that much."
0,"On my inaugural visit I was not at all impressed.\n\nWe had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was 3/4 empty.  Then, after ordering, I was presented with a Baby Spinach Salad without any dressing on it at all.  The Buttermilk Biscuit Croutons were very good, but the dish just did not come together as a whole.\n\nThe fairly large shrimp in a Shrimp Cocktail were meaty and cold, but not that tasty.  And the Horsey Sauce accompanying this app was just too mild.  When my entr\u00e9e at length arrived, its diminutive appearance was quite underwhelming: two small fillets of Pan Seared Trout with Cilantro Rice, cut carrots, and Sweet & Sour Cabbage that was not juicy and neither particularly sweet nor sour.  The trout tasted better than it looked, but it was just average in quality.  \n\nService was very inattentive, and there was a long break between preliminaries and delivery of the entrees.  Seating was comfortable, but the whole vibe was more that of a coffee shop than a casino's featured restaurant.  It would be pretentious to call what was served to my party of four \""fine dining.\""  \n\nReportedly a new executive chef is now in the kitchen, and some new menu items are already being phased in.  But I highly doubt that I will be back.  Even at a special January promotion price of 50% off for locals with a Downtown Grand My Points player's card, I did not feel that I got good value for my money.\n\nXX-1/2 stars overall!"
0,Very bad food!
0,"Worst experience ever.\nMy boyfriend and I went to BevMo on 12/22/14 to buy everclear for the holidays. They had the higher proof version (190) for the same price as the 151 at Total Wine, so we were stoked! Unfortunately after we went through the check out process, they decided to not sell the alcohol to us, due to one of us only having a vertical drivers license as an ID. We're both well over the age limit to buy alcohol, but they refused the sale to either one of us. \nThe total was originally $21, they placed a $30 hold on my card and today I find out that Bevmo POSTED THE CHARGE TO MY CARD. THEY HAD TO CANCEL/VOID THE SALE. SO NOW, RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, WE'RE OUT THE $30. \nI'm still in shock over how terrible of a business this is.\nUnethical treatment, and stealing of people's hard earned money is no way to run a business. AVOID AT ALL COST!\n\nAdditionally, Fry's Food and Drug carries the 190 Everclear for $2 less than BevMo (just to give you another reason to never go there again.)\nHere's hoping I saved someone the hassle of dealing with this dishonest merchant."
0,"Brunch food is cold, didn't get drinks refilled once. But the homemade tortillas are soooo good!!! As are the churros... Not having drink specials for brunch probably won't bei g me back to this place..."
0,"This was possibly the most disgusting hotel I've ever stayed in. The first night, the fire department was there removing an overly intoxicated person. The second night, the cops were there arresting a prostitute. There were bugs in my bed, my sink didn't drain, and the shower floor buckled like tissue paper when I walked on it. The electrical sockets went off when the lights went out,  and every single thing in the room and bathroom was the lowest possible quality. The breakfast buffet was nearly inedible. The pool was never unlocked and looked pretty filthy. Despite how cheap the rates were, I would recommend sleeping in your car before staying here."
1,"This place is a gem - one of the best little local joints within miles!\n\nTaco Stand:\nI don't think you can get a better taco in the city - authentic - pick your preferred meat (or potato & pepper veg option) and load it up with all the condiments that you could want - best part - $2 a taco - its hard to justify cooking when the food is that good and that cheap!\n\nMarket:\nI love this little place - fresh produce, meat, and other items all in this little place. Need something quick, just run in and grab it. I have used it more than half a dozen times for quick needs or when I need authentic ingredients and don't want to hunt all over town for them. \n\nI will be back over and over again...."
1,"I eat a lot of baguettes, and although I enjoy most, it takes a lot to make me crave one nowadays. It has to be really well made and a cut above the rest.\n\nI can honestly say I had one of the best baguettes EVER from Dolce Vita. A sly one on Dalry Road, it looks fairly simple but subtly elegant on the outside, with the owners not feeling the need to have any brash, over the top signage. Inside, it looks clean, fresh and minimalist without being cold. There are a few delicious cakes and doughnuts in the window, but nothing too excessive. \n\nThat's what makes Dolce Vita so excellent - it's a breath of fresh air. Keeping their menu broad but fairly simple, they serve up the nicest, soft baguettes with absolutely divine deli fillings. With varieties from cheese to mixed peppers, they combine different tastes so there's something in here for everyone.\n\n I went for the salami with cheese and peppers - it was amazing and SO cheap. What's more, the staff were down to earth, chatty and friendly while also being very professional. The girl serving me was so attentive but very laid back, so I felt relaxed while waiting for my lunch. I'd had a rough couple of days but she was really kind, and cheered me up by looking after me for the time I was in the shop.\n\nThe food was unbelievably cheap for the quality of the bread and fillings. They were delicious, as was the pink doughnut covered in hundreds and thousands! What else can I say other than this place was excellent? With amazing food and lovely staff, it's one of the best places to grab a takeaway lunch in this region, if not in Edinburgh!"
0,"Really gone down over the years. I had the ribs, it was covered in a sauce that was overly sweet. The meat was hard and very dry, and burnt. A couple of pieces I just couldn't even eat. It felt like I was gnawing on a bone of bad pork jerky. I don't know if they were trying to hide how bad the meat was with the overuse of sauce. This place used to be good, don't know what happened."
1,"We were staying in the Palazzo and really wanted sushi so we came here.\n\nDefinitely get the family style recommendation option. \n\nBasically, you tell your server what you like (like yellow tail, tuna, avocado, pork, miso, etc.) and a budget, and they bring out family style dishes within your budget that they think are matched with your favorite ingredients.\n\nThis was amazing - we wouldn't have ordered many of the things they gave us.\n\nDefinitely ask for some sushi, and definitely ask for miso-braised sea bass - this was the best item we had!!!!!\n\nOtherwise, just let the kitchen do the work for you. The surprise element is great too. If you don't like a dish, the kitchen takes it back with full responsibility too, which is great.\n\nThere's two areas to sit in, the front area near the entrance and the \""sugar cane\"" room in the back. We got sat in the latter, and it was much cooler than the front. Quieter, a little darker, and more \""exclusive\"" seeming than the front."
0,"I HATE THE EMISSION TESTING SYSTEM IN ARIZONA!! I dread having to go there every two years to get my car checked.  They say \""Thank you for helping clean the Environment\"" when you pass, but are you really helping?  The older cars that need the tests the most are exempt from the testing.  Now, today, I had to go my car tested.  I somehow developed a flat while waiting 45 minutes in line, waiting for the test.  And they were more than happy to point it out to me.  Then they told me that they could not test the car with a flat.  So I had to go get the flat fixed, wasting another hour there.  Then it was back over for another 45 minute wait in the hot sun to get the car tested.  When I pulled into the bay, they told me to turn the car off and go sit in that pleasant little booth while they tested the car.  The guy looked at my gas cap, put a probe into the tank.  Then he charged me the $27.50 charge.  At that point, I thought he was going to tell me I failed because I had replaced the gas tank, and had an issue with the input pipe.  Well, he simply handed me the form and told me I passed.  WTF!?!?  They never opened the engine, never started the car, never stuck a probe in the exhaust, nothing.  just that little probe in the gas tank.  WHY IN THE HELL COULDN'T THEY DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SAVE ME HAVING TO WAIT ALL OVER AGAIN!?!?! Clean up the environment, hell.  How can they tell if I am not polluting without doing some kind of test on the car itself, or at least look at the engine!?  Then I have to go home and register the car online.  The whole freaking Emission test system should be thrown out and the company that contracts the work shut down. It is nothing more than a sham.  And why does Tucson get to pay half less?  Why don't people in Flagstaff or Prescott have to participate in the program?  They can come down the hill and pollute our air, and we have to pay for it.  It is simply a money-making scheme for the state.  It serves no purpose whatsoever, other than to drain our wallets."
1,Very affordable and delicious. From the salad to the chicken bowl. The veggies are fresh and perfect not mushy at all.
0,The first thing I has to say about this place is that it is NOT Mexican. They need to change the name of this place or something because this is not Mexican at ALL. \nI rally hate this place and about every single person in my Mexican family hated it. \nEvery single one of them agree that it is not Mexican at all. \nTaco Bell would be more Mexican than this. I'm embarrassed of this place. \nI've eaten here 3 times and I hated everything. My parents hate it too and we couldn't even finish our meal. \nI have no idea how anyone could eat here. \nI eat almost anywhere and I hate making bad reviews but this place is just that bad.\nIf people like it then that's fine and all but I can't stand that it's called Mexican.
0,"This location is terrible. I don't understand all the glowing reviews. I come here as a matter of convenience. It's close to my home. I have given it more than enough chances but it's always something with this place. \n\nThis has to be the busiest grocery store I've ever been in. Every time I come here no matter what day no matter what time it is packed. The produce section is the worst. Always a lot of people with a lot of carts and you have to maneuver around every one. People stand around at the little sections of produce and you're forced to wait. A lot of the plastic bad dispensers have no green ties. \n\nAs you walk away from the produce section and head to the meat section you're playing bumper carts with everyone else. I mean seriously I'm constantly feeling like I'm on a slalom course with my cart maneuvering around hoards of people every where. \n\nThe meat section is terrible. Chicken, arguably the most common and popular meat and yet on about 4 different occasions including today there is hardly any chicken to choose from. It's like these people take their sweet time stocking the shelves. There is never any beef for stir fry either. You have to go over to the counter and ask them to carve it up for you. \n\nThis is the second straight time I have come here and there has been no regular milk stocked at all. The milk section is about 5 rows high and 3 of them were completely empty. The only milk here today was soy milk. Did I mention the constant hoards of people? People walking slow, leaving their carts in the middle of the aisles, people everywhere. \n\nI go up to the checkout and I get rung up but there is no nagger in sight. So then I stand around and wait for the cashier to bag my food and I even help. I don't mind bagging my food I suppose, but that shows poor customer service. This is probably the fourth time I've paid and then had no bagged to bag groceries and I have to help the cashier do it. \n\nLast but not least the savings don't seem good at all. When I lived in California and went to Ralph's I would usually save around $25-$35 when my total bill was around $120. Yet every time I come here my bill is $120 and my savings are $8.75? \n\nI really need to find a different location to shop at."
0,"My two-star rating for Sam's Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \""southwestern.\"" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \""Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\"" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time. As persuasive as his \""selling techniques\"" were, we weren't (having a good time), so we didn't (order more)."
0,"First, let me say I really hate to give bad reviews.  I love to support local business owners.\nI drove 15 miles to buy cake pops but when I arrived they were out.  The young lady working behind the counter  could have taken the time to nicely explain why they were out of cake pops, instead she wanted to be RUDE!\nI decided to go ahead and order some cupcakes, they were rated best cupcake by New Times so they had to be good, right?\nWell they were just okay.  Nothing to brag about.  \nI would have gone back to buy the cake pops but based on the rude service, I will not return."
1,"Really like this place, have gone twice now, and will go back.  The menu is small, but fresh, really fresh.  It is a fish house, not a crab shack or chop house, fish, fresh yummy fish.  The salads are also very good.  The cab. vinaigrette, is just delish.  I loved the halibut and my coworker loved the bacon wrapped Chilean sea bass.  Service is very good, wine list is MASSIVE and the food is clean.  Nothing over the top, just fresh fish prepared well."
0,Don't do it... Save you're money for the M resort Studio B buffet it might be off the strip and 15mins away but its worth it. Spice Market was mediocre and costly for absolutely no selection. I should of read the reviews before going there...Shame on me!!
1,Are at a few Greek places and I gotta admit this it's my favorite one. Service it's good and food is great.
0,I thought I would really like this show but it was SO BORING I kept falling asleep. I felt like I was a parent forced to watch the school play cause I had some retarded kid in it.  We ended up leaving during the intermission.  We had excellent seats-section B row N  and got the tickets for free.  The costumes were neat and there were some cool set/scenes but  I would be upset if I had paid $440 ($110 each). I would rather watch the movie any day.
0,"I was running late this morning and the hunger pains were kicking in on my way to work when I made a quick decision to drop-by Starbucks.  This particular one has a drive-thru, which is awesome, except everyone else thinks so too!  The line of cars was too long for my impatiences, so I decided to park and make a quick run inside.  Let me reiterate my need for quickness, as in swoop inside, place my order, get my coffee and split like an overripe banana. Of course when your in a hurry, no one else is.  So was my fate today at Starbucks.\n\nI've always had terrific and timely service at this Starbucks' drive-thru.  The person taking my order is always chipper and pleasant, and when I pull around to pick up my beloved cafe mocha, I'm always greeted with a smile and a lovely \""have a nice day.\"" \n\nNot so when I entered the sanctimonious inner-chamber of Starbucks! No one to welcome me at the counter; baristas working here and there completely ignoring me; and me standing there trying to grab their attention with my awkward and annoyed demeanor.  Finally, a barista  glanced over and said something that was barely audible.  A minute later, he finally noticed me and said curtly, \""Wadda ya having?\""  \n\n\""Uh... a tall cafe mocha and, and, um, do you have blueberry muffins?\"" \n\n\""Aren't there any over there?\"" he pounced. \n\nI responded timidly, \""Oh, I guess so, I didn't look.\"" \n\nHe grabs a muffin and my drink and sets it on the counter.  \n\nAnother barista, a surly old dude from the East Coast, pops by and says, \""Wadda get?\"" I told him, gave him my credit card, he processes it, hands it back and moves on to the next person.  No \""thank you,\"" or \""have a nice day.\"" Nothing.  I was kind of stunned and walked out with a little huff and puff... and I wish I could blow his house down!\n\nSo the lesson of this little story? Avoid the inside of this Starbucks at all cost, especially in the morning. Obviously the real gems work the drive-thru. \n\nI guess Starbucks 3hr shut down last week didn't cover customer service skills."
0,"I can summarize this in one word.  YUCK!  We went for dinner/supper, which is part of the problem.  We ordered t-bone steak and chicken.  The salad bowl had a hole right through the plastic and the steak was way thin.  We ordered it medium and any steak that thin just ends up being cooked as \""well done\"" anyway.  Everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not.  At least the staff was friendly enough and food (if you call it that) was served quickly.  My personal recommendation is that if you're not going to eat breakfast, go somewhere else."
0,"So my hair stylist moved to Hawaii and I desperately needed a hair cut. After reading the reviews I decided to give Hotbox a try. I called up and they were able to get me in same day, score. The lady on the phone wasn't overly friendly, but asked my price range which I definitely appreciated. I walked in about 10 minutes early and my stylist was waiting for me and took me in immediately. The place is very open and has a fun vibe and some disco music playing. She asked me what I wanted to do and I told her that I wanted to go shoulder length with maybe a little angling around my face. She was a little apprehensive at first because I was cutting 8 inches off, but I do this about every other year so I told her to go for it. She said she would add some layers too and it seemed like we were on the same page. So she shampooed and conditioned my hair and started cutting. She was friendly, but didn't make a ton of small talk so for the most part it was pretty quiet. She said that she would start with it a bit long and then cut it shorter if I wanted and I definitely appreciated the apprehensiveness to just hack it all off. Well, she ended up starting it off pretty short and just kept cutting from there. After she was done cutting, I asked her to straighten it for me. As she was blowdrying it she was making curls and said it would look really pretty that way, so I let her do it that way. When it was finished I hated it and it looked a little longer on one side, so I hoped it was just the curls and asked her to straighten it so I could really see the cut. Well she straightened it and I just wasn't sure, so I left. When I got home it was evident that it was longer on one side, by almost and inch, and the angling around my face was much longer on one side, in fact one side hit me under my chin and the other side hit me just above my jaw line...seriously!! I am pretty low maintenance when it comes to my hair, in fact I rarely get it cut more than twice a year and I am generally happy with whatever cut I get. In this case I am furious and devastated. I have a cut that is lopsided and the only way to fix it is to cut more hair, but I feel like I barely have any hair left! There are very few hairs on my head that are shoulder length, the majority are these tiny little layers. I look so masculine, almost like Peter Pan. It is definitely not cute and considering I have naturally curly hair it is almost worse curly! I seriously have never had a bad hair cut, this is my first time and I can't wait for it to grow out. I would not recommend this salon to anyone!"
0,"So my boyfriend was giving me a hard time for being a bratty princess with the need to stay at a fancy place. Ok, fine, I'll show you. I booked this hotel as a Christmas \""gift\"" to him just to show I can stay in such \""cheap\"" place. \n\nAnd boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe. \n\nMy boyfriend said we're never staying here again. HA! Proved you wrong hunny and even you were appalled. \n\nDON'T STAY HERE!"
0,"These are horrible pharmacy people they would not fill a pain prescription for my dog who has cancer and needs his meds every 72 hours. Manager even got involved and still would not fill it even though I have been to other CVS pharmacy's in Tempe near my work. Would not call other pharmacy nor my vet to do her \""research\"". Ended up having to drive 60 miles round trip to Tempe to get it filled and spent over 3 hours.  My dog suffered horribly that day and night because it takes 8 hours to kick in which I told the pharmacist and almost had to make the decision to put him down. Luckily this morning because of the great Tempe location he is feeling better. But all could have been avoided if the lady pharmacist at this location filled my dog's prescription and did her \""research\""!"
1,"I've gone to a couple of 'quiz nights', Tuesdays at 8pm here at the Jaggerbush.  They have absolutely wonderful beer specials 5-7pm ($2 any beer), and cheap drinks all the time.  The quiz night is especially fun, and high energy with a young crowd, and its free. Winners even get gift certificates  The bartenders are attentive, but the place still does allow smoking, so be prepared.  I haven't been overwhelmed by the smoke, but I still smell like an ashtray when I've left.\nI'll be coming back for the beer and the trivia, and suggest you try it out! \n\nI've also been hungry enough to grab some fries here, I won't do that again.  This is a place for drinking, not for eating, which is where it lost its star."
0,"NOTE: A duplicate of a review of this place under a different name.  Just noticed that this place is listed under two different spellings: Grand Canal Cafe and Gran Canal Caffe...\n\nAt first glance, it's a charming little \""neighborhood\"" Italian restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Simple decor, even a bit cheesy but in a lovable way.  It's comfy.  It's friendly.  You feel quite welcome when you arrive.  It's like dining with friends or extended family members.  \n\nOnce inside, though, we were deflated by the decor.  There are NO windows, and an odd configuration to the two claustrophobic rooms.  The chairs aren't terribly comfortable and there are NO tablecloths.   \n\nBut I didn't let any of that bother me because I had heard the food was terrific.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers to share: cured beef and scallops. Both were delicious.  We ordered the cannelloni and veal piccata.   The cannelloni was good, but nothing special.  The veal dish was average.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment -- and a clue that attention to detail is NOT a specialty -- was the rotten lettuce in the salad.  Not one or two pieces of lettuce, but a good half-dozen in each salad were beyond wilted -- soft and brown.  \n\nWe had gelato for dessert.  It was disappointing.  \n\nThe service was reasonably attentive but ineffective.  We had to ask for water CONSTANTLY!!!!   And, after the first round of drinks before dinner, we were never asked if we'd have liked more.  \n\nOkay, but hey, it's a neighborhood restaurant, right?  Casual, family dining, right?   WAIT!  $110 for dinner for two at a \""neighborhood\"" place?  For THAT kind of tab, I would have liked tablecloths, better service and a more even quality to the food.  \n\nWe might go back, but I'm not sure..."
1,Awesome!   Go.
1,"Kohinoor is one of the few places that I have seen that actually serve dinner buffets.  They have a large variety of options, which is great.  The naan is fresh and toasty right out of the oven, and the food is well seasoned across the board.\n\nThe owner was really nice to me and gave me some extra sweets to go as a trial for my first time.  Unlike most buffets that have 1-2 common desserts, they have quite a variety of choices if you are into Indian Sweets.\n\nThe people working are extremely nice and have a great sense of humor as well."

1,"I guess at 29, I fit into the \""older\"" crowd...I realized this after reading reviews from 21-year olds.\n\nFirst of all, this is a LOUNGE.  Get it straight!  Do not expiect a big flashy club like XS, which is a completely different experience.  We came here after our grand dinner at Mix restaurant and grabbed a table to finish off our dessert wine.  We also ordered our standard vodka tonics and vodka redbulls for about $10-12 each, pretty standard in Sin City. This is a good place to make out with your guy in small booth or hang out with a group of friends while enjoying the music and amazing view.  We started our night off here, then headed over to the clubs afterwards.  There's a very small dance floor if you feel like shaking it but most of all you really just feel like enjoying the dark ambiance of the lounge.\n\nI suggest beginning the night here and warming up for the more intense clubs after."
1,"This place is right down the street from my new office, and thank goodness! They have a wide range of baked goods, including gourmet breads and pastries, cookies, and other goodies (even fresh hummus!), as well as great iced tea and other drinks. I walked down there today and got a wonderfully delicious sandwich on their fresh 9-grain bread, along with chips and a drink for under $8. The staff and owner are all friendly, the place is charming and has dine-in seating indoors or on the patio, and they make it fast and fresh. Thanks, Bread Basket! You guys are awesome. I'll be coming in more often for sure."
1,"Baja loco: good food, nice staff, great atmosphere, my favorite is the grilled fish tacos, along with the margarita, it makes a great meal."
1,Its really hard to trust people when working with your car. They either upscale you or try to sell you things that you dont need. Joe was true and honest with his price. His work is worth the money spent. As with other reviews on here I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DC Window Tint for your cars tinting needs. Thanks again Joe.
1,The speedway is fun.  Parking was pretty easy to get in and out of and the racing I got to see last year was a lot of fun.  We sat in some luxury boxes and were served free food and drinks (including beer if that's what you wanted).  I ate until I was full and had a great view of the action.  I do not have any comment on prices of food and beverage because mine was all free since I got some free VIP tickets through my work.
0,Ordered Togo for the first time and the pho was disgusting. I had to throw it out. Very disappointed and will not go back.
1,"Love, this place. And the Sangria's are to die for. Sunday they have an awesome brunch and Sangria's are half off! The food is great for dinner and the bread they bring out at the begining with the dipping sauces...EVERYTHING IS GOOD!"
0,"State Street Brats sucks. Normally, I hate to be so blunt in a review but that essentially sums up my SSB \""experience\"". Very dimly lit sports bar with over priced, overcooked food. Important to note, they cook the burgers well done, unless you specify otherwise. Brats taste little different than you'd get from a gas station. Always heard good things about this place. Not impressed."
0,It's not that great. Better off to drive 10 more minutes and find a better sushi place. Also it always smells like bad cleaning products.
1,"Great Stay During Business Travel in Sept 2013\n\nClean, modern, comfortable bed, good gym, indoor pool, two bars, a Starbucks in the lobby, and great downtown location.\n\nSide Note, the architect of this building is very cool."
1,It's a Subway... The staff is personable and offers good suggestions. Everything seems as fresh as it can get at a subway.
1,"When I was introduced to this Vietnamese restaurant last year, it was hard to forget. The restaurant is clean, service is friendly, and food is awesome! Oh, and how could I forget the extremely reasonable prices? The only complaint I have is that they don't have a website...but I'll try to remember what I've had!\n\nWe usually start with the fresh spring rolls. They aren't anything special, but the peanut dipping sauce...mmmm. I could eat that by the spoon if it came in a jar!\n\nThe pho is near perfect in my books. It's a huge portion, and the broth is well seasoned- I can't stand it when I order pho and it comes with what tastes like chicken broth. If I wanted chicken noodle soup I could open a can! There is a good ratio of noodles to broth, and there has a decent amount of meat. You can't go wrong ordering pho here.\n\nThe last time I was here, I tried some sort of chicken curry \""soup\"" that came with the option of noodles or bread (we opted for the noodles). It was excellent but very spicy. However, that didn't keep me from eating more and more; in fact, it was near impossible to stop eating. It'll be hard to pass that down when returning to Pho Van for my fix of pho!\n\nIt's hard not to give Pho Van 5 stars, but I'll have to stick with 4 for now."
1,"I love this place. They truly have the best coffee drinks in town.  The scones are out of this world and so are the brioche.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."
0,"Maybe I went on an off night but at this price, I would never expect an off night.\n\nThe staff is great and they recommended a really good bottle of wine.\n\nOn the other hand, the steak was pretty bad. It was cooked to order, a nice medium rare with outstanding sear, but it just didn't taste good at all. I just find it hard to ruin a rib eye. It was dry and very bland.\n\nI can't recommend anyone going here."
1,"Wow. Woweeeewow. Fresh, flavorful, fast, reasonably priced. Yes!\n\nAre you that kind of person that doesn't like just one thing on your plate - but likes to sample many things and take a bite of each thing over and over going round the plate til you're done?\n\nME TOO.\n\nGadzooks is a dream for you and I! So many inside filling choices, so many topping choices, so many salsa choices... I basically tried everything and it was all amazing, and there are lots of veg friendly options including an outstanding corn bread filling that sounds weird but is so creamy and tasty you'll go nuts. And the tortillas are awesome which is a necessity. \n\nI pretty much want to order another round and just spend the day here. Don't judge me you'd want to, too, if you were here."
0,"What happened? I used to go on these tours all the time, since it was a great way to find out about Edinburgh's history and have the pants scared off you. However, my last visit in June '13 was appalling.\n\nOur guide, Peter, was half-demented and told some stories that were vaguely interesting, but mostly rambled about knowing Sean Connery's family and being on Blue Peter (can you say \""frustrated actor\""?). When he took us to the \""haunted vault\"" underground, he made no attempt to build any atmosphere, and there was no \""jumper ooter\"" at the end. \n\nThat was my last tour with Auld Reekie. They have the best vaults to tour, but have obviously given up on making any effort on giving their customers a good experience."
0,"I've been a long-time fan of \""Pawn Stars\"", so when \""Pawn Shop Live!\"" came along, I grabbed two tickets immediately.\nI spent regular intervals of the show quietly apologizing to the person I roped into coming with me. I also regularly asked, \""Why is this happening?\""\nMuch of the play is exposition. LONG exposition. At these times, there is no joy, no humor, and no smiling. \nMost of the rest of the play is spend with a nod to the fact that the \""Old Fart\"" is portrayed by a weird, giant puppet upper-torso, operated by the over-worked actor giving this play (and his many different parts in it) his all. At times the torso is abandoned to sit on the stage as the actor plays another part. Everyone winks and nods and plays up the fact that the production is too... cheap, I'm guessing... to just hire an old man actor to play one of the most central figures in the story.This becomes unbearable as the Rick character carries on ad nauseum about his dad, when the \""old Fart\"" should be out there telling the story himself.\nAs if all of this weren't tedious enough, there is a multi-media aspect in the videos they cut to from time to time. These are rudimentary at best, but there is a dream sequence the with \""Chumlee\"" character where he's fighting ninjas for no reason that goes on to the point where I thought I might lose my mind.\nThe production ends with a rousing musical number about how you should bring your stuff to them because they want to but it. CRESCENDO! \nSave your money, wait a few hours, and go see Gordie Brown."
0,"This was mediocre.  Its definitely NOT the bagel cafe which they seem to be trying to mimic.  The corned beef hash isnt \""the mother of all hash\"".  It tastes homemade but not as good as other homemade around town.  If you're hungry dont order \""the classic benny\"".  My boyfriend order that and got what looked like two open faced sliders with hollandaise sauce. We shared a bagel amd even that dissapointed us.  \nBesides that it was tiny inside the restaurant and stuffy."
0,"This is by far the worst frys I have ever been in. I am a pretty dedicated frys shopper, however, this frys is gross and dirty. The checkout lines are always out of control long and getting through the parking lot without getting hit by a car or cart rolling by, is a miracle. Though it is my \""home\"" frys I will drive 4 miles out of my way to go to a different one."
1,"Extreme hole In the wall very easy to pass by. With that said, it's amazingly good. I recommend getting the mulas and the cemitas. Very fresh quick and flavorful. And if you are anal about cleanliness it too is also. Give it a try you won't be regret it. Oh and by the way the tortas and cemitas use fresh bread baked daily, I beleive they get it from the Mexican bakery next door."
0,"Albeit, authentic, this cafe is VERY over priced.  A lot of truly lovely imports and tastes of the mother country.  The staff are very knowledgeable and have good recommendations of what to try.  I and a friend checked out this place due to the extensive reviews written up about it.  I have lived in neighbouring countries to Russia, in the former Soviet Union.  For two coffees, two small bowls of borscht, a slice of rye bread, and one can of kvas - the total was over \u00a315!  The cafe is rather cramped with only 2 tables, and not much room to stand.  If you go, check carefully what you are getting and ask about pricing in advance, or bring a hefty purse."
0,"THIS HOTEL DOES NOT EXIST!!!\n\nIT'S A SCAM!!!\n\nHow do I know?  I found out the hard way...\n\nBack in January, I was searching for a good hotel in Las Vegas for an upcoming business trip.  I was delighted to find this page for \""The Royal House\"" hotel.  It had great reviews and decent rates, so I quickly booked a room for four days through the website above, http://royalhouselv.com/.  Shortly afterwards, I received an e-mail confirmation, they charged my credit card, and all was good until I called to confirm the reservation.\n\nThat's when I learned:\n1). There's no such thing as \""The Royal House\"" hotel.\n2). The real hotel is \""The Royal Resort.\""\n3). The Royal Resort contracted with the people who made http://royalhouselv.com/ to sell rooms at their hotel.\n4). That contract ran out on January 1st.  (I booked my hotel on January 3rd, and as of April 4th, http://royalhouselv.com/ was still up and running, accepting hotel reservations!)\n\nI talked to a manager named Victor from The Royal Resort.  He blamed the whole thing on the other company, and took absolutely no responsibility for what happened.\n\nIt apparently would have killed him to send an e-mail to the people at Yelp to get this page taken down, or write a review like this one to warn people so they are dupped.\n\nEven worse, he said they had rooms available when I had booked them, but wouldn't honor the rate that I was given through http://royalhouselv.com/!  The \""discounted\"" rate he offered me was 3-4x higher than what I paid.\n\nIn the end, I had to call my credit card company, dispute the charge, and make other plans for where to stay.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!"
1,I'm a big fan of this place. They have wonderful service and amazing breakfast food. Try the Carnitas with the Salsa Verde and egg. Coffee was HOT and Abundant.
0,"Was expecting better. Ordered a 1/3 pound cheeseburger and fries. The wait time was average. When I got home to eat a few minutes later, I was pretty disappointed. The fries were hot, but had no salt on them. There was also no ketchup or salt packets in the bad, so the fries were not that good. The burger was equally bland. There was no seasoning on it and I can tell that the burger was not fresh. It was cold and seems like it was grilled hours before. \n\nFrozen burgers, frozen fries, no flavor. \n\nSad, I was expecting more."
1,If your a NY/NJ transplant to Phoenix and miss the Italian Bakery & Deli that you took for granted in your old neighborhood then rest assured because Romanelli's will make you feel like your back home.\n\nGreat cold cuts and subs.  Everything high quality.  Amazing homemade Italian sausage.  You got your Polly-O cheeses like back east and Wise potatoe chips and cheese doodles.  \n\nEveryone mentions the Canolli and it deserves it.  I am not sure its the best I have ever had but its up there and they will get you fresh ones upon request with no hassle.  \n\nEverything is fresh and everything is delicious and for a NY/NJ transplant it is a refreshing spot when feeling a little homesick!  \n\nThey even got great freshly baked Italian cookies and breads.  \n\nThank God for Romanelli's!!!
1,"We recently went to Vegas & stayed at the beautiful Aria Hotel. The hotel boasts six restaurants & this is one of them. Tapas have been really trendy the last five years & so many tapas restaurants fall short of executing really good Tapas dishes. But this is Julian Serrano! I couldn't help myself so we bee-lined there Saturday night.  The decor is bright &  there are lots of mirrors. I don't really like watching myself eat & it seemed every time I looked around I caught a glimpse of either myself or someone else stuffing their face!!  So this isn't the most intimate place in terms of being romantic. Tables are pretty close together!! In fact we felt like the people next to us were with us!! LOL! Drink menu is impressive & the sangria is refreshing & delicious. They have some nice beers, tequilas & spanish wines too. In fact the wine list is very impressive. Now the food which I was very impressed with. We shared everything & we started out with the mixed seafood ceviche which had octopus, shrimp & whitefish. This was so fresh & the simplicity of the lime & cilantro really highlighted the fish. Next the gambas, saut\u00e9ed shrimp, garlic & arbol chilis. This was fantastic too.We decided to try the \""new\"" tapas so we went with the lobster-pineapple skewer w/ \""molecular\"" pineapple & sesame oil. This was not one of my favorites. molecular food can be tricky & I am kind of sick of the foam or gelatin type textures when chefs introduce this food. The lobster was delicious but the molecular part  which was the pineapple had a weird texture. Not my fave but still good.\nThe cheese platter is fantastic and it has cabrales, goat, la serena & manchego to name a few. The stuffed dates, olives & gazpacho were all fantastic. One of my faves was the escalivada which has roasted eggplant, red pepper, onion & tomato.  The service was just okay but the place was really busy so I will cut them some slack.\nSo my ratings are as follows:\n\nAmbiance: 4 stars\nService: 4 stars\nMenu: 5 stars\nFood: 5 stars\nWould I go back...absolutely!!"
1,"The wife and I recently went for dinner at Cafe Monte on a friday night. From the moment we entered the building the ambiance was perfect, low lighting, french classics playing in the background, pretty lively but by no means overwhelmingly busy. The food that I had, warm baguette to start, steak frites for my main course, finishing with the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, was all excellent. My wife also enjoyed her risotto and french macarons. Excellent experience, would recommend."
1,"On this, my first visit to BT's, I got takeout... I shall update if I find the opportunity and company to eat in, but this review is juuuuuuuust for my takeout experience, which was okily dokily (like a 3 3/4 star).\n\nI was brain dead this particular evening.  Long day at work with lots of numbers, which make me derpyduhhhhhhhh.  I really wanted to get Chinese takeout, but have vowed to try new places (so I can Yelp about them!).  BT's wins for this night.\n\n4 stars for the interior - very cool.  Nice open space, although the flow to order/checkout is a bit odd.  The menu is up at the top of the wall and spread out - the next time I will check out the menu beforehand so I know what I am getting, my poor old eyes aren't what they used to be.\n\n5 stars for the poor employee who drew the short straw and had to wait on me.  When asked what kind of cheese I wanted on my 6 oz bacon cheeseburger, my reply was \""orange?\""  (seriously, it had been that kind of day).  I also ordered a regular order of tots and a 1/2 order of fried pickles.  \n\nThe haul:  When opening the bag, I noticed that the fried pickles and tots are in styrofoam cups with no lid on them, sitting up in the bag.  This prevents steam from sogging down the fried goodness, but since I take corners going 45 mph, I had tots and picks all over the inside of the bag.  No big, now I know how they pack stuff and I shall be more careful with the placement of the bag and my NASCAR driving skillz next time.  I had many ketchup packets (YAY!), and since I had asked for mayo on the side, I had a small container of mayo as well.  Points for granting my request of condiments on the side as to not make my buns mushy (mushy buns are bad!).\n\nThe burger:  Cooked as I had requested and juicy.  The bun reminded me of a round version of a Wendy's bun for some reason.  The bacon seemed to be fresh cooked instead of pulled from a container of bacon that had been made at 9:00 am.  Points for that.  Yum.\n\nThe tots:  Soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside.  I like my tots to be super crunchy, but these were tasty.\n\nFried pickles:  Not pickle chips, not spears, more like those sandwich stacker pickles?  Nice crunchy, well flavored fried coating.  I had some ranch dressing at home that I dipped them in.  \n\nI am anxious to go back and try a hot dog with chili and cheese.  The sweet potato fries also look pretty darn tempting.  I shall return!"
0,"Two stars is generous considering what was delivered tonight. I have had worse, but not often. The food was sub-standard by any evaluation, and almost an hour late to boot. The Kung Pao shrimp was wimpy. Likewise the Chicken in Garlic Sauce, contaminated with green bell peppers that we specifically requested be omitted. Seldom have I tasted blander Chinese food. The cook on duty tonight was simply incompetent.\n\nSupposedly they're \""under new management.\"" This is probably a BAD thing.\n\nTo be fair, I grew up with very good Hunan & Yunan style Chinese food. I am spoiled. I do know the differences among good, mediocre, and lousy. To call this mediocre is generous."
1,"Stop the insanity! I'm not sure why The Haze has been hit with so many mediocre reviews here, because I really think it's one of the coolest and most innovative BBQ places I've ever been to. Pick your choice of meat, then have it prepared Eastern-style or Western-style (accompanied by either rice or Texas toast) - what could be simpler yet more brilliant than that? And the food is excellent - similar to the standards of the other Muramoto restaurants but at a lower price, while still maintaining locally-sourced ingredients.\n  I suspect that to a lot of people out there, BBQ means dousing a piece of meat in brownish-red glop and throwing it on the grill. Maybe they're just not comfortable with this alternative take. Or maybe it's high expectations, or jealousy at the Muramoto chain's success: I don't know! I probably would've given 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I could, but there is NO WAY this place deserves to average 3 stars! I'd hate to lose one of my favorite restaurants because of a bunch of knuckleheads."
1,"Wanted to spend a Saturday at the pool with a bunch of friends.  Wanted to get a cabana but not break the bank.  I was quoted anywhere from $1500-4000 for a cabana at the Paradise Pool (where the pool party takes place).  So I opted to call my Amex Platinum Concierge.  They gave me 2 different price options.  $750 Food and Bev min for the Paradis Pool for a basic cabana or $250 min for cabana at the Nirvana pool.  After reading some of the reviews here on yelp, we opted for the Nirvana pool and was glad that we did.  \nWe arrived at 10am to secure the cabana.  They have you go there \""airport\"" like security to get to the pool.  For the party pool, you have to wear swimming trunks (no reg shorts) and no big bags for the ladies.  However, for the Nirvana pool, you can pretty much wear anything.  No food or drinks.  I suggest getting the \""complimentary\"" wristband for the party pool as well.  We got a great cabana (#130) located right next to the walkway up to the party pool.  The cabana could comfortable seat 5-6 people inside with 2 lounge chairs out front.  There is a TV, safe, fridge (not sure what the purpose is since you can't bring in food or drinks), and fan.  We were right next to the sandy entrance to the pool.  The pool is nice and not your typical hotel pool. You can bring out your drinks and just chill.  The DJ in the morning was spinning classic rock, that turned into Top 40 by the end of the day.  It is crazy that you can't hear the music from the party pool next door.  Food and drinks were reasonably priced.  Bucket of beers (5) were going for $30-35.  Service was awesome.  Everyone was hustling back and forth to get us our food and drinks.  Never had to wait long.  \nWe also enjoyed walking over to the other pool and checking out the scene. Then walking back to our cabana to relax.  Even though this is the \""family\"" pool, we didn't see that many kids at all.\n\nIf we every return to vegas, we would love to do this cabana again."
1,"three other A/C repair companies made us wait at home for their service calls, only to show up and be too scared to climb up on our roof. enter Steve, from cool blew. he shows up, checks things out, and says, \""yup, i can get up there and fix it\"". exactly what you want to hear when your a/c is broken in the summer of AZ. \n\nand he did. fixed it and now we are chillin again! thanks steve!"
1,"if there was anything u want to splurge on ur trip to vegas, it would this show. KA was actually my first cirque show and it got me hooked! the show is absolutely amazing! the storyline is easy to follow even though there wasn't much speaking. the stage is something u never seen before. it comes apart and raised vertically, where u see the performers glade across the raised stage. it's a bit pricey but u can always find a deal online. i would recommend arriving early to see some performers in the lobby of the KA theater. just remember to look up. definitely a must see!"
0,"Did a google search for a place close to our neighborhood that served prime rib (pregnant chick craving), and low and behold...this place specifically had Thursday night prime rib specials. \n\nThe service was friendly and fast, the prime rib hit the spot but...I can't honestly dub it the best I've had here in Las Vegas - granted, I've only had prime rib at the Broiler Room inside the Boulder Station which is were my love of prime rib started.\n\nIt's close to our house so...I've probably be back when the craving hits ;)"
1,"OKAY...\n\nSo on my connecting flight home, i once again landed at Sky Harbor. \nI had a great weekend, i was exhausted, and i suppose I didn't have much energy to hate on everything.\n\nSecond look at Sky Harbor, it's not so bad.  I suppose i wasn't in such a grumpy mood for having to stay here for 5 hours again.  Although I do still hold up to my previous statement that seating is a bit limited and that there aren't many food choices...but an airport is an airport right?  \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get an opportunity to check out the Art Museum suggested by a fellow yelper (yes, they have an art museum!) but I was just glad to be on my way home. \n\nAnd this airport is HUGE. I was lucky enough to have landed in A second time around because my connector was in A, but last thursday, i landed in B and trekked all the way to A to reach my connector. It was quite a walk."
0,"Be careful with these ppl. They will break your stuff. They broke a lamp of mine. missing a tote that had special mementos of my deceased mother. Said they were going to be at my home at 400 never showed up until 9pm. still charged me the same amount. \""owner\"" came in just grabbed the money and left. didnt tell the workers that they were supposed to take me with them to the new place. which was right down the st. they also seemed like they were high or drunk. screw this company!!"
1,"Prinzipiell finde ich die Idee der \""Steakh\u00e4user\"" klasse. Das Restaurant in Karlsruhe zeichnet sich aus durch gewohnte Maredo-Qualit\u00e4t und erfreulich gutes Personal. Fast jedesmal, wenn ich da war, ist das Restaurant voll, und dennoch wird man schnell und freundlich bedient. Deshalb lande ich hier oft nach einer stressigen Einkaufs- und Bummeltour durch die Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone Karlsruhes. Die Preise k\u00f6nnten ein klein wenig niedriger sein."
1,I've grown up on Roscoe's Chicken in waffles but I enjoyed this place so much more. Plus you don't smell like chicken when you leave Score!
1,"The Filiberto's of the West Valley!!! Really like this place! I have been here about three times, get the same old steak and egg burrito, w/beans and potato's! And of course add a little bit of pico! Never been disappointed, a very large serving, and has had very good service. Place looks like its closed down! But it's not, they just blacked the windows to keep the sun out! Family keeps on asking me when I will take them? Soon!"
1,"This is how much we liked The Mission:  2 dinners, 1 lunch and 1 time for drinks and apps out of 5 days that we were in Scottsdale.  Weather was perfect and we sat in the patio.  Get the guacamole!  We ordered the kale salad, spinach salad, fish tacos, Crispy Cola Pork, Pork Belly Pibil, Pork Shoulder tacos, Pumpkin Bread Pudding and the Primarita Margaritas.  Lots of Primarita Margaritas!  Guess you could say we got addicted, so much so we made it our last stop before heading to Sky Harbor to fly home."
0,"Without the fun mariachi band, this place would have gotten one star.\n\nWhile we were seated right away, we didn't get a server for at least twenty minutes. Even tough we did get chips and salsa, we were waiting so long for service that we went through the chips and had to serve ourselves another basket. \n\nOnce we finally flagged down a server, we got to order. The food took at least another twenty minutes to arrive. And three of us just got the quesadilla! \n\nNow, the food. When a quesadilla is on the menu for $8, it's typically enough for a meal. The quesadilla was one corn tortilla with some cheese and like three pieces of meat. It was so small that it made the price offensive -- and it wasn't even that good! \n\nTo add to such a bad experience, three of the five people ended up with stomach aches. I would not recommend this place at all, especially given the fact that Burger Bar is next door and is about the same price."
1,"Wow!  What yumminess!  Apps were just ok (had the calamari and the fried mushrooms), but the caprese salad was awesome!  Chopped tomatoes in a bowl with slices of mozz on top, and a balsamic.dressing in the bottom.  So delicious!  One of the best I've had.  Had the creamy chicken marsala (over linguine) and HOLY CRAP was it AMAZING!!!  One of the best pasta dishes I've had in my life.  Tremendous flavors!  Who knew I'd drive to Queen Creek before I'd eat Italian in Mesa?  Nice!"
1,Been here quite a few times when I lived near Old town. Shame we moved to south Gilbert but I still call Harpers if I have problems with my plants. Mark has helped me numerous time over the phone with lots of patience and knowledge. I would probably drive 45 mins to come here next time I need my nursery fix instead of my local nursery.
0,"Pool is nice enough but seating is limited. Also they are going the \""young hip\"" way here with the topless area being a club type place instead of just a seperate area like in the past or like Wynn.\nAlso 24.00 for a mixed drink., really 24.00 why people WHY do you put up with this and pay these insane prices. That same drink was 6.00 in 1997. What has changed? The casinos started pushing the limits to see what they could get away with and the people kept paying so they kept pushing. When will it end? A 52.00 jack and coke???"
0,"I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient! \nBut I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible.\nOn more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience. \nNow when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama."
0,I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited. \n\nI was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't. \n\nIt is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.
0,"I was in the mood for a salad, maybe my mistake. It was not tasty at all. Processed cheese and meat, lettuce too hard and no flavor. I hope the sandwiches are better but wouldn't bet on it."
1,"Manager did provide me with a $25 credit to make up for the experience. The second time around, the service was much better. Food wasn't bad either."
1,"Best place in the valley for dim sum.  They are always consistent.  I've been coming here for over 10 years.  Since I'm allergic to MSG and dim sum always contains MSG, I often order off the menu and request no MSG.  I'll eat some of the dim sum and suffer the effects of MSG afterwards.  My dim sum favs - har gow, sui mai, char sui bao, and coconut dessert.  Dinner - best peking duck with the buns and steamed fish.  Overall, good place for chinese."
1,"The food here is really good, the service is eh.  But I am giving this 4 stars because the food really was just that good.  The bread pudding was the best I've ever had and I don't LOVE bread pudding-- but I LOVED this one.  Also, they make their own ice creams and their are delicious.  The fish I had was extremely fresh. I am no food critic, but I did grow up on the East Coast beaches of NC, so I can say with certainty the fish is fresh.  I love that they use local vendors for most of the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and hip.  \n\nMy complaint, the service.  Flighty is a word that comes to mind.  The food took a really long time to come out and I have yet to figure out if that was the kitchen staff OR our waiter not putting our order in on time.\n\nAll that said, this is a place I will most certainly come back to."
1,"My husband went here for a french dip while the rest of us were lost on Fremont Street. Luckily, he let us all taste it before devouring it himself. It was so good, we decided to come back on our last night. Which happened to be a Monday, the line was long and stayed that way. I had the 49er and it was delicious. We ordered two more french dips as well. It was great and the price is awesome. \n\nI am not one for shrimp but by the looks of it people love it. There was continuous slew of empty sundae glasses (which the shrimp cocktail is served in) being cleared from tables. \n\nGo here, its worth it. The atmosphere is classic Vegas. No trendy crowd or hoochies here. Just good times."

0,"I stayed at the Trump Hotel for 2 nights this week for work, and was incredibly disappointed at the lack of transparency surrounding phone charges.  I was taking meetings all morning today.  My phone died late morning, and I had to use the hotel room phone to complete my calls.   When I went to check out, I learned I'd been charged $164 for 47 min spent on the room phone.  The price for calls wasn't listed anywhere on the phone, as is generally done at respectable hotels, and while I knew it wouldn't be free, would've completely rescheduled my meetings had I known I'd be charged so excessively.\n\nWhen I brought this up to the desk clerk - who appeared to be about 21 yrs old - he said that was just the policy and at check-in should've been told that only local calls were included.  I was never told that, and asked if I could speak to a manager.  He went back to retreive a manager, but instead came back and offered to take half off one of the 2 charges.  I didn't have time to haggle, so just accepted it and went to the airport.\n\nI am incredibly disappointed at the lack of transparency, and then the lack of responding to the issue I raised professionally.  The manager couldn't even come out to the front desk to speak with me personally?  I assumed the Trump organization would have more professional staff employed.\n\nEven with 50% removed from one of the charges, I was still charged $102.48 for 47 min of talk time.  I don't think I should be charged anything considering a) lack of phone information clearly displayed or explained, and b) lack of professional demeanor in handling my conflict.\n\nThe only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 here is because a) the hotel and room were beaufiful, and b) Nathan, one of the valets, was extremely nice and helpful every time I had a question re: directions.\n\nPS - also negative?  NO casino!!"
1,"I'm a big fan of pizza + I'm a big fan of dessert = I'm a big fan of Villa Dolce. This is my favorite cafe in the Madison area. It's got pretty neat decor and an alluring color scheme.\n\nMy favorite time to go to Villa Dolce is during lunch, where they serve the \""pizzette\"", your own personal pizza with a very enticing price tag. I really dig the roma and the white cheese pizzettes. I'm also very happy with their stromboli of the day specials. Their regular pizzas are also quite tasty with a good variety of selections. \n\nBut what I look forward to the most at Villa Dolce is after my pizza consumption. Amazing dessert!! Their gelato is okay, but the tiramisu, chocolate mousse, and nutella crepes are to die for!\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and check out Villa Dolce."
1,"The Chef here is amazing, food perfect, service awesome, the bbg mesquite was perfect, the shishito peppers with the miso to die for. Chef came out to speak with me, going to come for dinner, try out some steak.sine of the sweet corn soup."
0,"Was really disappointed by the food.  I had the burger which was way overcooked.  A shame to ruin all of that good hamburger meat by cooking out all the juices.    Bun was soggy also, bleh.  Also had the falafel fries which were way overcooked.  Sweet potato fries were good though.\n\nTook forever to get food... Maybe cause it was labor day?"
0,"Refusal to give a kid a courtesy cup of water! We live in Arizona & from what I understand it was 100\u00b0F today, the kid was drenched in sweat and you would not give him a cup of water?? WOW  making $0.50 is apparently more important than helping prevent a heat stroke. Did I mention it was for a kid?! Unbelievable!!!!!"
0,"I read a review that their Philly cheesesteak was similar to Chicago's style... I highly disagree! The hotdog that my toddler ate was disgusting. The potato skins were ok. Although, the suicide wings were great. (but the hotness was more of a medium heat not suicide) The service was extremely slow but friendly staff. I don't see myself dining in but maybe I will do a take out on wings and try their pizza."
1,"We love Zada's! Jodie makes the best Mimosa and Bloody Mary and always has a smile on her face.  Great variety and selection of healthy, fresh, and local food whether you are a vegetarian or not. The bacon is amazing as is the French toast and their Huevos. Sometimes we just grab a biscuit to go which is also a great option. \nDon't miss out on this spot! It does get crowded at high times but Jodie will make you a mimosa or there is free coffee while you wait!"
1,"Overall good quality but not as exotic as Bellagio's buffet.   I rate it the same as Bellagio's because of the lack of exotic items. However, Wynn's decor is nicer, and more elegant.   Surprisingly, there was not much of a wait at 6:00 pm, only 15 minutes.  It was kind of like one of those nights at a popular amusement park ride where you expected a wait of  atleast 1 hour.  I did not find much sushi, only a couple of different rolls and no sashimi but I was not really looking for buffet sushi.  Their Chinese section was also a bit scant with broccoli beef as the main feature.  Highlights: king crab legs (good with no addictives but just the natural flavor & no dryness), Chilean seabass, prime rib, gourmet salads in an individual cup, gelato, a complete desert section.  Even though some of the categorical sections were a bit scant but overall the quality of everything was higher, better than most Vegas buffets.  I would rate it 4.25 stars but since this is about as good as Vegas buffets - 5 stars."
1,"Tonight I am having the Buffalo Mozzerella Salad for appetizer and BBQ Chicken Pizza for my main entre.\n\nThe salad was not bad.  I could have used more mozzarella and tomato.  Balsamic vinagarett was a reduction, I think.  Whatever it was, it was very good.  I shared it with my dinner mate.\n\nThe BBQ Pizza is amazing.  I like my BBQ sause sweet and the sause fitsthw bill. Everything is fresh and made to order.  The only hint I ammnot understaning is why thy pit corn on it.  I ordered it without the corn as I could not imagine it with corn.  The deep dish crust is amazing.  It is doughy and chewy and tastes great just like I like it.\n\nIm conclusion, it was a great night with great food and great company.  You should have a good time.\n\nPs, they have beer to."
1,"Yes, I'm a fan!  Cool Furniture!  You can usually something in Teak wood!  I've seen some cool deals and great steals here!  The Owner is good about talking to you!\n\nThe thing I Love most about Vintage stores is the Treasure hunt - there is no telling what you may find in a place like this!\n\nIt is always poorly lit and it is usually kind of cluttered though not as badly as my Apartment - The Mannequins add to the experience for me and my friends!"
0,"This small family-owned eatery is a bit difficult to locate as the given address is on N Decatur Blvd, but the entry is on Vegas Drive.  I ordered a short stack of pretty ordinary pancakes while Ann could not resist the day's special, apple cinnamon French toast accompanied by an excessively sweet, sticky syrup plus 2 eggs and bacon."
1,"The *ultimate foodie* stop on my SW eating adventure this summer, no other chef amazed me half as much as Payton Curry.\n\nMy husband and I lucked out on our last night in Scottsdale with a reservation at Digestif.  Not just any reservation, but we lucked upon a special Sunday night cocktail and food pairing that was beyond our wildest dreams, called the \""WITH A TWIST\"" Cocktail party.\nMost of the guests were friends of the chef or favorite regulars, but we lucked upon two cancellations.  We were seated around the bar which takes up most of the tiny restaurant.  This is not a usual bar with a bartender and bottles of alcohol behind it, no no, this is a chef-centric bar with the kitchen in full view. Incredible.  \n\nWe were served our first pairing - grilled bread smothered in Mobay cheese with a BLT-ini.  The vodka had been bacon-infused. Wow.\n\nSecond was lardo-wrapped Peaches served with an awesome cachaca-based drink.\n\nThird was buttery housemade prosciutto with an \""incogroni\"" - aperol, gin and pineau des charentes.  Very special, a little bitter and a fabulous aperitif.\n\nThat was followed by a fabulous halibut ceviche, the main course of lamb chops paired with a \""lavender sidecar\"" which was to die for, and finally a dessert of flan with a lovely dessert cocktail.  \n\nI'm not sure if you can get these drinks and items on the regular menu, but the chef is such a down-to-earth, cool and motivated young guy that I think he would make about anything you could ask for, and that's as likely to be the case with drinks as well.  I can't sing out my praises loud enough for this incredible spot where the food and the chef are centerstage - right where they belong.  Fantastic, 5 stars."

0,"I've given up and Pittsburgh barbeque, and was loathe to try Mr. Willie's.  How bad can it be, I asked.\n\nBad.\n\nOrdered the 16 piece barbeque chicken meal with three sides and cornbread.  The chicken was not grilled, or heaven forbid, actually smoked.  It was basic baked chicken, doused in barbecue sauce.   Not barbeque by a long shot.\n\nThe sides were awe-inspiring in their awfulness. Red beans and rice was simultaneously hot and bland, made with perhaps ketchup and hot sauce.  No celery, onions or peppers or thyme.  Like a rice-a-roni version of red beans and rice.\n\nThe greens were mixed kale and collards, and not inedible.  Bizarrely, the meat used in the greens was corned beef.  Traditionally, soul food greens include ham hocks or smoked turkey to give it that great musky, funky taste.  But corned beef seems to be some awkward concession to its Squirrel Hill location.  \n\nCornbread?  A hand wrapped two by two inch square of crumbly corn-bread in wax paper.  Looked inedible, and in fact was.\n\nService?  Awful.  Apparently the lukewarm write-ups from Munch and City Paper inspired him to try to increase business by grunting subaudibly to his customers.  Woo-hoo!  \n\nPrediction: the location turns into a kosher restaurant by March of 2009. And it's a shame.  Except in home kitchens, soul food is dead in Pittsburgh."
1,"I wanted to get a nice steak while in Vegas.  There were several options in Venetian/Palazzo alone.  I picked this one because, well, bam!  No but I figured a guy like Emeril Lagasse would make sure his steakhouse served a nice steak.\n\nThe decor inside is nice and clean, not a whole lot going on.  The opposite of a Red Robin, say.  Service was duly attentive.  Caesar salad prepared table-side was a treat.  \n\nWe went with cocktails over wine from the rather pricey and extensive wine list.  I didn't even eyeball the list personally.  But a generous portion of Bombay Sapphire satisfied nicely.  \n\nI went with a bone-in New York, medium-rare.  It was cooked expertly.  It had great texture and flavor, a nice creole seasoning rub on there but not too heavily applied.  The beef did the talking.  Or the mooing.  It was good.  Only ordered one side on account of a late lunch and we're not rich: mushrooms sauteed in butter.  I feared some pain old sauteed buttons would come out.  But I was rewarded.  A hearty mix of flavorful 'shrooms, like oyster and chantrelle and maybe porcini or shiitake came out.  Lovely.  And buttery.  and Garlicky."
1,I'm from Nebraska and stay here a lot this was the best experience at ordering online I've had here the food was perfectly prepared and believe it or not sit your self down but the order was right when they got it to the door and still hot !!! WOW I can honestly say the worst place is the pizza hatters if ya know what I mean their orders are never right sooooo..... you guys are our new pizza place keep up the good work and don't make me sad I took the time to write this but really good job
0,"Ok, im not getting the great reviews on this place. I FINALLY made it Lamar's before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts. I have a few problems here. The big one, can we please list that \""only the donuts with holes\"" are $5.49 for 6? Its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over $7. Makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else. \n   Second, these donuts are WAY over priced and they are average at best. The maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet. And the rest of the donuts I tried were pretty stale. This will be the first and last time I will be going to Lamar's. Give me Krispy Kreme or anyone else for that matter. Thank god for Lamar's we dont have Spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business."
0,"Meh, it's too \""This is my new haircut\"" scene.\n\nThe girls are okay, not the best looking by any means, especially for Scottsdale, and the guys seem well, to go there to only impress guys?\n\nNot impressed at all and was rather disturbed by all the spiked hair, shaven chests and sunglasses being worn at night to further emulate the clientele's doosh factor."
1,Surprisingly small place.  Melds very well with the Clarendon's decor.  The torta is messy but oh sooooo good.
0,"We tried to eat here. I don't know why Paris thought it was a good idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3,000 room resort after midnight on New Years. On top of that, it looks like they didn't bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned. We waited in line for about a hour, partially because they were letting all the Platinum and Diamond members in before everyone else. After a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it. This caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line, although we were still not seated since there were still Platinum and Diamond members waiting in the express line. After a second group left and told us the same thing (food taking forever to come), we too decided to leave. We waited a hour in line for nothing, although I guess it was better that we left since at least we were eating a few minutes later at another casino. Horrible planning on Paris' part."
1,"Liberty market is fast becoming one of my favorite lunch time treats. They have a menu that while not huge seems to have something for everyone. I am in love with their white pizza. The bread is fabulous and while it has some unique ingredients(Arugula and pine nuts) they are not just their to be trendy they truly add to the flavor of the pizza. \n\nThe atmosphere is great and it is going to sound weird, but you should make a trip to the bathroom while you are there."
0,"I just visited outback steakhouse tonight with my husband and two children.  This was one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a restaurant, and we eat out fairly often as a family.  The waiter completely forgot our appetizer.  It took a good 25 minutes for my daughter to get apple juice.  When the mains finally arrived, the waiter came by and asked how our appetizer was.  We said we never got it, and he said he had no idea what was going on in the back, and asked if we wanted it then.  We said no, but noted a few problems with our mains.  The BBQ chicken, was plain without the advertised BBQ sauce.  My daughter's parmesan pasta, had no parmesan, etc.  It took another 10 minutes to get the BBQ sauce and parmesan.  My son's steak was actually cooked the way he wanted, so that was in their favor.  My kids wanted milkshakes for dessert.  It took 20 minutes before they brought them, and they brought the wrong kinds.  Ultimately it took 45 minutes and a talk to the manager to get my son a milkshake.  Again, the waiter just said he didn't know what was going on in the kitchen.  We were not the only one with problems.  A man seated behind us had a cold steak and had to have it re-done.  A lady another table waited about 30 minutes for a glass of wine. The restaurant was not busy.  There were perhaps 6 tables with diners.  We will not go back.  We felt like telling people at the door to just leave.  2 hours, for a mediocre meal, and terrible service is not something I need to go through again.  Skip this one, and go to one of the many better restaurants around here."
0,"Sadly, I have to give Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, a less than stellar review. I can only muster the kindness to give this restaurant two stars.  I must admit, that were my rating based solely on my latest dining experience there, I would give the restaurant three stars, and, had I based my review solely on my first dining experience there, I would have given four stars.  I'm sure that you will ask, \""How does the average of 3 and 4 equal two?\""  The answer: disappointment.\n\nThis will sound silly, but bear with me.  The reason I returned to P&G after my first visit is also the reason I will not return: potatoes.  Specifically, two potato dishes: the Potato Puree and the Pub Fries.  These were not ordinary mashed potatoes and French fries.  These were a demonstration of what a potato can taste  like if a fine-dining approach is taken when preparing ordinary dishes.  Every now and again you taste a dish and experience it for the first time all over again.  Such was my experience with the fries and mashed potatoes at P&G.  They made me feel that, as a foodstuff, potatoes have much more potential that I had previously imagined.  \n\nThe key to their french fries was the cooking technique: thick-cut potato planks, steamed, then lightly coated in seasoned flour, then deep-fried, then baked.  The result:  a hearty potato plank with a crispy outer crust that created the perfect seal to keep steam inside.  When you cut into them, you discovered a steamy, flaky potato meat.  These fries did not need any condiments whatsoever, and highlighted how good a potato can taste if treated properly \n\nThe mashed potatoes had a beautiful flavor.  The fluffy peaks of this dish were topped off with a drizzle of a chive infused olive oil that exploded in your mouth, filling your entire palette with the aroma of garden-fresh chives.  The key to this explosion was temperature of the potatoes: served piping hot.\n\nOn my second visit, I ordered these two side dishes again.  This time, the Pub Fries were plain, old french fries, and slightly soggy at that.  The mashed potatoes were a salty, gluey concoction that someone had tried to repair by thinning it out with copious amounts of cream and butter.  They were served cold.  \n\nOther highlights of the evening: arrived at 7:15pm and checked in for my 7:15pm reservation.  The hostess forgot to check me in, and when I made eye-contact with her every time she seated a walk-in customer before me, she quickly looked away and left the podium.  I approached a different hostess and was seated right away.  I ordered the seared scallops: scallops were seared on one side only. They were served in a bland seafood broth, with carrots, and artichoke hearts.  Not flavorful at all.  I ordered an espresso with dessert and it arrived cold.  The chocolate mousse trifle was sensational, though.\n\nAt any rate, I believe that what happened to this restaurant is not  so much carelessness on the part of its founder or staff.  It is a reaction to the caliber of the customer.  I spoke to the manager about the food, and he admitted that they had to change some recipes because their customers did not see the value in waiting extra time for french fries to be cooked three ways or for mashed potatoes to be prepared to order.  So, they have turned from their fine-dining philosophy to a food-mill philosophy: crank out orders.\n\nAnd that is where the disappointment lies.  P&G once provided a fine-dining take on British pub fare.  It now caters to the lowest common denominator and provides tourists a place to grab a quick bite and gain some bragging rights: \""I went to Vegas and ate at Gordon Ramsay's.  You know?  That guy from TV?\""\n\nSadly, the Gordon Ramsay on TV is no longer anywhere to be found at P&G.  The Gordon Ramsay on TV preaches fine ingredients,  food prepared to perfection, good seasoning, good service, consistency, and, above all, passion and pride.  Where is the pride to be found when you don't stand by your food, and, instead, you cut corners to ramp up production.\n\nSorry, that's not fine-dining.  That's a factory.  I'll gladly drop $20 at Applebee's for factory food.  Not $200 at Gordon Ramsay's."
1,"Went shopping here with my friend for some shoes. And the experience was enjoyable. The staff were all very helpful, I think we had like 3 people helping us at once. And they all gave valuable opinions on how the shoes would look with the outfit and so forth. The store is two levels one for men and second for woman. They have a great selection of men clothing, I only been to Zara once before in Century City which was also a great experience. Anyway, if you enjoy modern/contemporary styles at a reasonable cost, go ahead and check them out."
1,"The name \""smalls\"" refers to the restaurant's interior space, not the size of dreams or expectations you'll find once inside the doors.  A local vibe permeates the environment: the chef is a Johnson & Wales graduate and the bar serves NC craft beers.  The menu is interesting and accessible, with a few varieties of down home sliders accompanying other worldly options like chicken & waffles and handmade pasta.  Once your order gets to the table, watch out; the food is rich, developed, and flavorful.  BUT... a month after opening, there are still some service-type kinks that they haven't yet worked out.  \n\nFriday night, I called to see if a party of 3 could be seated and was told that they were filling up, but if we got there in the next 10 minutes we should be fine.  7 minutes later, we walked in the door and were told there would be a 15 minute wait.  Not that big of a deal, we went to the bar for a drink.  The bartender was very nice, but sadly couldn't transfer our drinks to the table once we were ready to be seated, so we had to close out - again, not that big of a deal.  Our waitress (unenthusiastically) told us the day's specials and then took our order... which is right about when everything fell apart.  They brought only two of our three dishes to the table, of which only one was correct.  So they then took the pimento sliders away but not-so-sneakily tried to pawn them off on the table behind us - alas, the pimento sliders were not what they'd ordered either.  Apparently, our third order had never gotten put into the system, so they scrambled to make that and finally brought out a plain burger, having prepared it so quickly that they left off all the burger toppings (cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato) that were supposed to come with it.  So, now we send a second plate back to the kitchen.  Ultimately, we finally got the right sliders and burger with all the proper fixins, but it shouldn't have to be that difficult.\n\nHowever, the food was good enough to assuage those problems (it didn't hurt that they comped us the burger on our final bill too).  Assuming they work out the kinks, this place may need to be renamed Bigs, as I can see it being huge in the Charlotte restaurant scene."

0,"The fish on sushi is tmso thin and short... I asked for easy rice and they told me they dont give much rice in every order. compare to thin fish slice, rice is wayyy too much. I would give 0 star rating if I could. make sure u dont order rolls cuz it has much sauce and rice( they put soft shell crab inside and it was replaced wifh shrimp tempera). After ordering twice they dont come to your table even though u wave at them ; unless u shout out to get attention"
1,"Found Luna's on yelp while travelling from DC to Atlanta on March 31.  On the recommendation of others, I had the veggie burger and it truly lived up to its reputation! Easily the best veggie burger I have ever had.  Paired with a glass of fresh-made carrot juice, it added up to a very healthy and satisfying meal.  It is a bit tricky to find, especially if you're not local, but just turn into the Atherton Mill complex on South Blvd and go to the back corner."

She replied \""it's not us, it's the airlines\"". Then hung up on me. No goodbye or anything! WOW great customer service!! I think it's about time for a refund for what I was ripped off with this membership!! Absolutely NO stars!!!"
1,Burger Well done that's all I can say. Everything was on point from taste to speed of order. GREAT place to catch a quick bite before hitting the strip.
0,"OK.  This is a dominating casino if you want to get down to business and avoid the tourists.  It's where the locals gamble.  The pit bosses and dealers are all top notch.\n\nBut man, their hotel service is laughable.  This past Friday night, we stay in South Point gambling for 10 hours, until 8am; we also have 4 other households with us staying there.  Instead of looking for a cab to take us back to the strip, we opted to get a room there.  \n\nThere's an old man named Larry who works at the front desk.  I couldn't believe how rude, condescending, and arrogant this guy was when all we wanted was to patronize the hotel.  He wouldn't even check look for availability for us, so I checked online and found rooms available.  He still insisted we wouldn't be able to check in until 11am.  I am under the belief that if you recommend a hotel for 4 of your relative's families, and spend 10+ hours gambling there, they should accommodate simple sleeping arrangements.\n\nGet Larry a gig at the DMV, that's where he belongs."
0,I'm not a fan of this place. The food wasn't very good and it was overpriced compared to other sub places. The service however was very friendly and the store was nice and clean.
0,"This place was cool, but I would like to give them another try.  I had the salmon burger which was good, but I think they get more credit for their beef burgers.  My daughter had the Kobe Slider Trio which she said was delicious.  You get three sliders:  BLT, BBQ Onion and Blue Cheese.  They looked great... but sadly I didn't try them.  Environment was nice, but our waitress could use more training.  You don't start taking an order and suddenly excuse yourself because your other customers are ready to pay their tab.  You ask them to wait until you are done taking our order! So they get two stars from me for their service."
1,"I find myself at CherryBlossom a lot nowadays, and that's why I needed to update my review. I've discovered my new favorite menu items, and they must be eaten! So, you should try:\n\nSpicy Gyoza Pot\nCha-shu Ramen\nTanTan-Men Ramen\nUdon Suki\n\nThe gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.\n\nI have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!"

1,"I drive by this place all the time and finally decided to try it.  As I walked in I was greeted and asked if I had eaten there before.  After replying, \""No,\"" everything was explained to me about how the pie is made and how quickly.  I made my choice, paid, and received my meal very quickly.  The pizza was great as well as the service.  I will be returning to try another pie."
1,"My friend and I went there for lunch yesterday.   I have been there for happy hour and dinner, but this was my first time for lunch.   I had the PCG pasta, and my friend had the small Bethany Home Salad.   The flavors for my pasta were beyond great.    The chicken consistency was a bit on the soft side.   Was it \""real\"" chicken?    Dunno.   It was good, though.    I just found the consistency strange, as though it was chicken that was, what, retextured??   Notwithstanding that fact, I loved the sun-dried tomatoes and the broccoli along with the pasta.    There were crispy tortilla strips in my friend's salad that she didn't want so I put it on my pasta.   This is a hint to the restaurant:   Maybe put those strips on the pasta??   The crispness and flavoring of the corn tortilla strips were a nice compliment to the texture and flavoring of the pasta.   If her salad was \""small,\"" I hate to see how large the \""big\"" salad is.   I thought it was large enough for a full meal, and she did, too.    She liked her salad.    I tasted it.    I'm not a salad person, but the dressing was good and the ingredients in the salad were appealing to the eye as well as the stomach.    Since the restaurant is sort of in the 'hood, I definitely would go there again."
0,"Went to Kabuki for lunch with my boyfriend and left very disappointed. We mostly enjoyed the food, but the service was atrocious. \nOur server, Kim, was very rude and short with us for no reason. When asked any questions regarding the menu, she responded in an uncomfortably rude way. She brought my sushi before our appetizer and there was a long wait to get the appetizer and my boyfriends food. When clearing some of our plates, she took my glass of water without saying a word and walked away. She shortly returned with it refilled, but i was initially confused due to her lack of any kind of communication. \nKim was the entire reason we had such a poor experience. It's a shame because the rest of the staff seemed quite pleasant."
1,Cajun - Smajun - this place rocks!  Cabbage is to die for!  Quirky wines and unknown beers are there for the adventurous.  Lynn is a hoot - ask her for beets next time you are in (inside joke).  Their pimento cheese could bring world peace!  A must try but an even bigger repeat performance restaurant - eat here regularly and have never had anything but the best!
0,"I am standing here in the snow! 1hr and 10 minutes: Waiting for a taxi on state street that I was told would be here in 20min. I called 10 minutes ago and the receptionist said \""oh shit...you just missed it.\"" I have been in the same spot in the snow! Who missed what?! #serviceFAIL"
1,Benny florentine was great!! Great mix of flavors.  Atmosphere was nice
1,"I will miss you my fair, friendly, caffeinated friend...sniffle, sniffle. \n\nGood night, bad night, late night, good morning, bad morning, is it morning morning... this Dutch Bros is there for me and will be for you too. \n\nNext to \""customer service\"" on wiki, you will find a picture of the staff. Simply amazing. Most of the time, I never had to mention my order, they had it ready when I pulled up, as well as some friendly banter. After making this my local for over a year...I felt part of the family. \n\nNo burnt drip, just great americanos, excellent blended coffee drinks, and everything in between. \n\nWhether I ran, drove, walked, or crawled, this Dutch Bros was there to pick me up. As I head north to a new home...I will miss you my friend...but don't forget me, I promise to stop by."
0,"Don't order from Domino's Pizza in North Las Vegas. They charged my credit card, then messed up the order. They said I would not get a refund on my credit card for three business days. Just a few seconds of their mistake and suddenly I am responsible for the charges for three business days. This is a management problem. I hope someone in Domino's corporate manager reads this. This is poor customer service. I will never again order from any Domino's Pizza as a result of what happened tonight as I wait for three days for my refund."
0,Terrible experience. What was the point of making a reservation if we still had to stand in a cattle call cluster fuck and tip some host to get seated? Insanely overpriced for the quality of the show. Save your money.
0,"Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! \nWe purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business."
1,"I just absolutely love when I come across a place that surprises me like this one. When you first walk in there a few picnic tables and some benches with tables to sit on, but only a few. That's because Hogs Heaven's claim to fame is their delivery. But the place was packed anyway. The menu is a simple one that most Barbeque enthusiasts will love. Ribs, pulled pork and sides. A lot of people will tell you the only true Barbeque is Pork Shoulder. A finely cooked Pork Shoulder will make the best pulled pork sandwiches. Hogs Heaven has that as one of their signature dishes. I do have to say that I cannot tell you about the Pulled Pork this time. I did not try them, but there were a lot of happy customers eating them. I had to go for my favorite BBQ item as it was my first time at Hogs Heaven. My wife and I shared a full rack of Baby Back Ribs. (We had leftovers) I have to say that these ribs are in my top few of the best ribs I have ever eaten. When you grabbed onto them with your teeth they just came off the bone. They were so tender, juicy and succulent, and their Barbeque sauce was so tasty. Their Barbeque sauce is a vinegar based Barbeque sauce. I have found few of those in my lifetime that I have enjoyed. But, the vinegar taste was so understated that it just enhanced the flavors of the other ingredients and the ribs. Hogs Heaven has won me over to vinegar based Barbeque sauces.\n\nAs our sides of choice this time, my wife and I choose their BBQ Skillet Beans and a Corn on the Cob. The corn was fully cooked but still had a very nice crunch to it. The flavor of the corn was not overpowering at all. It just tasted like a good corn should. It was also very juicy. The beans were a big surprise. They looked like a regular serving of BBQ beans, but the flavor was indescribable. These were the best beans I have ever had. There was a little smokiness to them, but just a hint. It caught me off guard to see red Bell Peppers in the beans but they were a great addition with good flavor from the sauce. When I go back I will be sure to include the BBQ Skillet Beans every time. Their side dishes also include Potato Salad, Mac & Cheese, Coleslaw, Fried Okra, and Collard Greens. They also have Hog Fries to go with your meal. The menu also includes Buffalo and BBQ wings as well as a Mini Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mini BBQ Corn Dogs, and Animal Chic Fingers for the kids.\n\nFor dessert my wife and I shared a Peach Cobbler. I usually am not one for Peach Cobbler. But I enjoyed this one very much. The flavor of the peaches was subtle and combined well with the other ingredients. The crisp portion was a bit doughy and tasted more like a donut to me. My wife did not care for it that much, but I enjoyed it.\n\nAs I said, the place is small. But it is very cute. I enjoyed the ambiance. The staff are very friendly. They were by our table several times to make sure everything was OK. When we were ready to go they brought us a to-go container for our leftovers without our even having to ask. I asked about their delivery area and I was told that if you buy a minimum of $40.00 worth of food they will deliver anywhere in Las Vegas for only a $2.50 delivery fee. That is just two full racks of ribs if you are feeding four people.\n\nI can tell you that I will be going back to Hogs Heaven again and again."
1,"Excellent customer service from every staff member and clean. The burgers, of course, are amazing every time."
0,"place is a dump.\nWalking up the stairs and you see the cheap reconditioning of the walls paint . That I could care less. Walking through the room you see dresser that's scratched up and marks of not matching paint that of something someone would picked up at a curb side. And it's half way wiped.\nthe bed had like a $20 matress and the toilet seat had cigarette burn marking along with a complimentary pubic hair and screwed loosely to the bowl.\nThe wifi internet is slower than my cell phone in 3G mode. If you want acceptable speed you have to pay for it.\nThe Brenda lady in the front is absolutely useless. Get everything on paper. Her word means nothing.\nI'm glad I left the place and went to best western 10 min after checking in. \nAnd got charged for the 3 days and useless Priceline( fake reviews of place) didn't do jack.\nAnd a message to kylie's \""realistic comment\"". How does remodeling the place in the future make for a realistic stay today at extended stay America? \nIt's amazing what people write for money. Absolutely no shame.\n\nThis place. Is a health hazard and I will be notifying the department of health."
1,i came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. back in may the elevator ride up gave us a great view to start the evening\n\nwe got there a little early around 630 pm and were the first ones there. there were plenty of tables so reservations werent even needed. \n\nthe waiter was very nice. he answered all of our questions about every dish we were considering ordering. \n\nWe started with the foie gras w/ daikon . it was very good. the daikon really helped balance out the richness of the foie gras.\n\nI had the bison tenderloin. It was prepared just right medium as asked and very tasty..but nothing special. My girlfriend had the roasted duck breast. I wish i would have ordered that cause it was delicious. her dish consisted of  a roasted duck breast along with a separate piece of duck that had an very very tasty and crispy outer skin. I couldnt eaten that crispy skin all night. \nI would also recommend the fancy mac and cheese they have. \n\nall in all a very good dining experience. but its really just one of those places you need to experience once...
0,"Went here tonight around 8/830 with my boyfriend for the first time to see what the rave was about. From what I remember this was voted the best pizza in town so we decided to give it a try. The location itself is beautiful and the menu has a variety of options to chose from. We got the garlic bread with the marinara which was excellent. We also ordered the combo pizza which was okay, but not anything special. This place sits right between oreganos and Olive Garden in my book. For such a nice building I was surprised to receive a plastic cup and a paper napkin. The place was good but not enough to bring me back. \n\nOur server was nice but never once checked in on us or offered anything else to us. We asked for the box, check and dessert menu and had to request her to put our order in. This place didn't do anything for me but I can say I've tried it."
1,"My first time enjoying poutine, this place was recommended by the barista, a bar tender, 4 students and some random strangers.  They are open 24 hours.\n\nThey did not mislead us.  I tried the La Dan Dan, frites, curds, grilled onions, pepperoni and bacon.  My friends got the original, no meat, and the T-Rex, which had bacon, sausage and pepperoni.\n\nWe all got the small size, which was really more than enough for one person.  You could share it, but we decided to approach it like a cross country run, by pacing our selves.  Only one of us managed to clean the plate.\n\nWe all decided that all of it was very good, however to fully appreciate poutine in all its glory, we should have waited till maybe 3 a.m. after coming from a night of bar hopping.  \n\nWe left, happy, blissed out and very full."
0,"My family came in for the lunch buffet and it was literally the worst service in the world. After we finished eating we decided to sit and settle our stomachs before we left and literally not even a couple minutes later one of the waiters came up to us and said, \"" Aren't you ready to leave yet? We have people waiting so we need you to leave so we can clean the table.\"" \n\nAre you kidding me?! SERIOUSLY!? That was more than rude, that was unacceptable! I get that you're busy, but to push us out like that? We just finished eating! I guess all they really care about is the money, not the customers satisfaction.\n\nNever coming back."
1,"I bought a house nearby and noticed their label ont he prior tennants chemicals, so I went there. VERY friendly, remembered me by name the next time I came in.  Always greet me, analyze my water and recommend chemicals.\nTheir prices on chemicals are lowe than anywhere else, and if not, they amtch.  They also gave me a great deal when I spent $250 to stock up, enough of a discount that I bought a VERY good $60 pool raft too.\nI hate test strips, MUCH eaasier to let them analyze and suggest chemicals.  Highly recommend any branch, bt especially this one\nR"
1,"First, our server, A.J.,  was top notch and was a major reason for our group of golf buddies enjoying a great evening at CPH. He had knowledge of the food and great personality.  The cocktails and food were delicious.  The only negative comments I can say is that the crab cakes need a little work. But the chopped salad, the burrata, the short rib, the scallops, and the meatloaf were fantastic.\nGreat restaurant with lots of energy."

0,"Went into Topshop today to return an outfit and I was told by Sara \""the manager\"" that my clothes were too worn. She arrived to the counter in a horrible mood and didn't even greet me with a hello or how are you or  even introduce herself as the manager. I worn them for maybe an hour and they were still in perfect condition. She then told me the extra buttons are missing but I don't know anyone that keeps the extra buttons on their outfits while they wear them. Just the week before I spent $500 on clothes there and I just needed to return one outfit but she said that she sees clothes everyday and mine are \""wrinkly\"" so u can't return them for me because they have a few wrinkles she said yes and that's it. She was so disrespectful and very demeaning. I said then maybe I'll try to go to a different Topshop facility so I can talk to someone with better customer service skills and she said good luck because I'm the manager and were the only Topshop in Vegas. This is apparently the only Topshop in Vegas so needless to say I won't be shopping there anymore. Sincerely, a used to be a loyal guest!"
1,"We stopped at this charming little brew pub on a road trip and I absolutely loved the 1930s style atmosphere! It really adheres to its name. The beer, the food, and the service were great, and we had a wonderful time. I definitely would recommend this restaurant and look forward to giving it another try!"
0,"I heard the food was awesome, a point that was confirmed by a older gentleman just finishing his breakfast. He warned that the service would be slow, but it would be worth the wait. I had nowhere to be for hours and looked forward to a lazy morning. \n\nThen the proprietor emerged from the kitchen, a stern-looking fellow with thick white hair and a mustache. He sized me up and asked, \""Yeah, can I help you?\""\n\nI knew from reading other reviews of this joint that I was in for something strange. I wanted to experience this. \n\nI said, \""I'm just one. Can I sit anywhere?\""  \n\nHis response? \""I'm alone here. You better go someplace else.\""\n\nI smiled. I wanted to laugh, but I feared he might not react kindly to that. So I left and went to Hanlon's down the street.  I'll try again next time. Getting kicked out is half the fun."
1,"I think I liked this one the best out of all the buffets we visited (MGM, Cravings, and Aria). I've still got my fair share to try but I'm getting there!!\n\nThings that stood out: \n\nRamen! Not only was it awesome to watch them cook it, but it was absolutely delicious. \n\nIndian curries- delicious!\n\nCrab legs- They're everywhere but they were great. \n\nBaby sliders- Juicy and fresh! They were also small, which is a good thing!\n\nRoasted Veggies- random right? But they were seasoned very well and weren't too soft. \n\nThe little bowls that had an array of soups/ pasta dishes/gumbos- The presentation is so nice! \n\nThe green chili chicken with rice- the chicken was juicy, not dry, and the rice was delicious as well. It was hard not to eat too much! I needed to save room for more options \n\nMochi- so awesome!!! \n\nDesserts- There were a ton, and they were, for the most part, all amazing and delicious. \n\nI also like how you can almost get lost. The food kind of wraps around the wall and it just keeps going and going and going. In the middle close to the entrance is the dessert bar which is an entire circle filled with heavenly treats."
1,"By far the BEST blowout I've ever had.  Not sure how Shannon can do what she does with my hair but I LOVE her.  Way better stylists than that \""other\"" blow dry place."
1,"I tried this place out last night with a friend of mine. Great atmosphere. I didn't get to try out the rooftop seating since my friend isn't a fan of the outdoors. I have to stay I was a little unsure of what to order, but ended up choosing the Lobster Mac & Cheese. It was absolutely delicious!!! For the appetizer we tried the Sweet Tea Brined Wings. The wings were a hit but the dipping sauce not so much. It lacked flavor. I will definitely be a repeat at this place."
0,"I purchased a groupon for a partial, deep conditioning, cut and style. I really liked the atmosphere, but the reason I'm giving a rating of 2 is because my stylist Chealsie. She didn't listen to my request at all! I told her how I wanted my color and I even showed her a picture. She told me she does the bangs a certain way and I told her I didnt want them that way She ended up doing what she wanted. My roots were showing as if my hair was done at least a month ago. I also have the horrible tire marks on the side when I put my hair up!.She also complained the whole time about how tired she was cause she was out late with friends! Anyways I would have gone back and complained but I went into labor. So being a first time mom I'm now stuck with this awful hair style. All I wanted was a simple color and cut to last me for the next few months while I enter the world of motherhood. I guess I'm better off wearing a hat. Thanks Chealsie! As for the salon itself, everyone else was courteous and clean."
1,It seems like I'm always ordering the breakfast burritos when I come here. I wish I would change it up sometimes but they're so hard to pass up when I'm craving Filly B's!
0,"This place is okay. We've only been here once and while the environment was nice, the server we had was slow and didn't know the food very well. Also our food wasn't that good, plus it took forever to get it. I honestly had wished we would have gone to Outback Steakhouse instead, we've never had a problem with the Chandler location; great tasting food at good prices. While here at Firebirds my prime rib was bland and so was my boyfriend's steak. Nothing special even though you pay high prices. Ehh... I'd go else where."
1,"Great burger & shake & fries inside of Harrah's where we stayed. It was ridiculous prices, but thats Vegas I guess. For one burger, fries & a shake it was almost $30. The burger was damn good though and thick. It was a chimmichurri burger and then the shake was Neapolitan. Very very good. The server was nice, dressed like an outrageous gay dude but thats Vegas too."
0,"The food was old, but what do you expect at an airport late in the evening."
0,"Nice looking, mediocre service, small portions, over priced for food quality, dessert selection was extremely poor and not at all high quality.  Over all you pay for her celebrity name but everything is about $10 to much, next time I drop $250 on dinner I expect to have outstanding service and delicious food I would choose Olive Garden before I would return to Giada's."
0,"I would NOT eat here again.  The food way way too expensive for what we got.  We ordered a bottle of wine and I felt we got regular casino everyday glassware.   I would expect a nice expensive restaurant to have decent glasses not a glass you would receive while gambling or something.    \n\nThe tuna pizza was good but presentation rather boring.  We also ordered Kumamoto oysters which was about $32 for 6 and it was not anywhere near Asian inspired I felt like it was something I would have got at an Italian place.   Oysters and cocktail sauce is basically what we got.   We ordered the filet toban as well which smelled awesome but was nothing special.   The crispy kalbi roll was delicious but presentation was lacking!!!!  \n\nNow I don't mind spending money on my meal if the food and presentation and service was great but I wasn't really happy when I left.  The service was rushed and she didn't really listen to us, plus she kept telling us that was probably enough food in which was not and felt that she didn't have time for us.   Maybe she just wanted us to leave.  We were helped by another man who was dressed in a chef coat who was not the chef but was helping out he said and he was very personable and helpful more than our server was.  She kinda disappear towards the end.\n\nI Have high expectations for a restaurant in Bellagio and was highly disappointed.\n\nFood was ok...service lacking....and food presentation pretty plain.  Prices should be much lower for the quality of everything.    Even a sushi roll was between 20 and 30 which is fine is it's exceptional.\n\nIf you're looking for delicious Asian food Andreas at Wynn or chada Thai near China town is great and you get what you pay for!"
0,"I will never, I repeat NEVER visit this establishment again. After receiving a gift card for discounted dining offers, I confirmed on the internet that this place would honor the card.  I decided to take my son there to eat. They advised me that they would NOT honor the card AFTER they served us soup and our drinks. The total for that nonsense was 3.62. I was told that I needed cash and they wouldn't run my credit card for under 5.00. I promptly advised the woman that if she wanted to get paid for the bill, she would run my card for the 3.62 they were charging me, I would NOT be purchasing anything else from them to make up the difference. RUDE! I also contacted the Entertainment card customer service department as to find out why the discount wasn't accepted and to let them know that I am hesitant to try to use the card again. I will go to Panda Express next time. At least I can understand the people who work there while they are trying to screw me."
1,"Went here for a Yelp Elite event and had an awesome time.  They're still sorting out the kinks with service as they are under new management, but nothing glaring that would ruin an otherwise great night.  Their food is decent and not overpriced.  Try the coconut chicken or the cheesecake!  Tasty, tasty, tasty.\n\nIt's an interesting concept and I've never been to a movie theater before that you could also order dinner.  I would recommend that if you are going somewhere to actually really pay attention to the movie, this probably not your best bet since you'll constantly have people walking around and people chatting and taking orders for the waitstaff, so it would make it a bit hard to concentrate.  But if you want to have dinner and have a movie to play in the background, it's a great spot.  I can definitely see it being a good date place :)\n\nI'll be back in the summer, I'm sure!"
1,"This deli may seem out of place as it is set in a corner lot dominated by a Food City and other Hispanic oriented businesses.  Those who went to the old Chompie's in the same shopping center might even have missed it.\n\nHave been getting lunch here for quite a few years now.  It is a real Old World family run deli.  The meats in here are wonderful.  I think a Polish family owns the place.\n\nThe have a list of sandwiches that are all HUGE, super tasty and very affordable ( with tax around $7). Skip those chain subway shops and get a real sandwich here!\n\nAs mentioned by Daren, this place might take cash only.  I think they do take debit cards, but you have to order a certain $ min....be safe and take cash.  This place gets busy at lunchtime and there are about 3 tables in here.  Better to take you grub to a less crowded spot to savor it in peace...\n\nWarning: You will go for lunch and want to buy about 10 lbs. of deli meat!"
0,"Maybe because I have lived in New York, but I was really not impressed with the pizza. The crust was gluey and not crispy enough. The place itself was fine but I would not come here for the pizza again."
0,"There have been many times when I knew right away that I was in love with a burger, but rarely have I disliked one instantly. That is until now of course, in the case of Cheeburger Cheeburger. I actually stated \""I hate this bun\"" as soon as I swallowed my first bite, and it only went downhill from there. Read on if you dare.\n\nThere are apparently many locations all over the country of this place, although I can't say it's really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town. And after my experience, I'm not sure if I would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a stand-alone Johnny Rockets; 50's diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls. It's extremely gimmicky, and much worse than any Fatburger I've ever been near. It wasn't overly crowded the night I was there for dinner, but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.\n\nThe menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce 'beginner', along with chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads and the option of supposedly over 1,285,000 combinations of shakes. They offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter, pepperoni and salsa. I guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.\n\nI was excited to see Heinz 57 sauce as an option, and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. As I said, upon first bite the bun turned me off; it was incredibly dry, had no flavor, and was way too thick and large for the sandwich. It was grilled and buttered on the inside, but that little bit of flavor couldn't compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness. The meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor, but the person I was eating with didn't have as much luck so I question their consistency and must assume I was lucky for now. My mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount I was given got lost in the other flavors. And by other flavors I really just mean my Heinz 57 sauce, which completely took over the entire burger with its semi-BBQ flavor. I always thought I liked that sauce, but apparently not on burgers. I also must note that I only ordered the 1/3lb burger which I can easily handle, but this was so bad I only finished a little more than half.\n\nThe one positive factor of this meal was that because of my Foursquare check-in we were given a free order of small  1/2 fries and  1/2 onion rings. Both of them were ok; the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket. The onion rings were the thin, greasy, crispy battered type which I love, as opposed to the thick-breaded, hard to bite through variety. They were good, although I'm just not a huge fan of onion rings. They offer a few different dipping sauces; we went with the Zesty Horseradish sauce which was ok I guess.\n\nBy the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything. We almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating. The only tasty parts of our meal were the Oreo and Peanut Butter Cup shakes we got, and that's not something I typically order. With the free fries and onion rings our meal cost $25.20, it would have been over $30 if those weren't free. This price does include $7.98 for two shakes, but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were. $6.99 for a burger isn't a bad price, especially off the strip, but what I was given I wouldn't pay for again. I'm not even going to sugarcoat it, just avoid this place."
0,"Horrible experience nearly every time I had to go here during my pregnancy. I was left with no choice but to switch drs/ofcs in my last few weeks of being pregnant. If you come into contact with Dr Miller's scheduling nurse, Claudia, beware! She is so rude and was the final straw in deciding to leave this office. She should not be allowed to interact with patients. Even though you have a set Dr you have to see a different Dr every time you go in. Most of the Dr's are condescending and come across offended that you ask questions. Dr Miller rarely made eye contact with me, which is unacceptable from a Dr that will eventually be performing a surgery on me. It felt like a cattle call when you get in there. They want you in and out as quickly as possible. They are irritated when you ask questions. If you are looking for a caring Dr this is not the place to go"

1,"I've eaten here twice in the past 30 days. Obsession? Maybe. But when you consider that the first experience CHANGED MY LIFE, it's no surprise. I had ordered the filet au poivre, truffled mac 'n cheese, and the grilled beets with burrata. Everything was amazing, especially the service. My martini was impeccable.\n\nWhy then have I given it only four stars? Well, the next time I returned I ordered precisely the same things, with the exception of the martini and beets. Don't judge me, I'm on a budget. \n\nMy filet this second time was lukewarm when served, my wine tasted like it had sat in a decanter for far too many weeks... Yes, weeks... And the au poivre sauce this time was a tad watery. The mac n' cheese was spot on, however! As was the service. \n\nI can't complain though. For a restaurant that had me paralyzed with delight after the first bite, I'll allow a temperature flaw once.\n\nI can't wait till next time! (which, given my record as of late, should be any day now)"

0,"Where to start? It's coma Sunday and all we want is some good delivery food. BBQ sounded like a great option. Started off ordering online and several menu items are not even on there to order. We decided to call and order and it was comical I had no idea what was going to be delivered or if it would even come. On the plus side it was pretty fast but probably because they forgot half the stuff. No utensils, no BBQ so the pork and ribs were dry - the Mac and Cheese tasted like noodles with no cheese and cake tasted like it came from a school cafeteria or a retirement home. I just can't. Ending on a good note I give a hells yea to the slaw. \n\nAfter this madness we called back and ask them to bring us sauce because otherwise the meat was not eatable and they said they would bring it right over. Great! Unfortunately they never came. Left still hungry and very upset.\n\nXoxo"
0,"I won't be going back.  My son's hair was butchered.  I'm not exaggerating!  Several people commented on how terrible it looked.  I had to go out and buy scissors to fix it.  Since we left the shop with his hair wet it was hard to tell it was so messed up.  I mean different lengths, rat tails, just awful.\n\nMy daughter got a trim and that went well.  They barely took anything off and I think it would be impossible to mess that up.  They put a little braid in her hair and that was cute.  This place is probably fine for a trim.  Maybe we just got a bad hair stylist.  I know we didn't get the one that everyone is raving about on here."
0,"Ordered online from Tatum store at 6:30, expected delivery by 7:30.  I called store at 8:00 and told the order was out for delivery and should be there any moment. I cancelled order at 8:20. Almost 2 hours and poor attitudes on the phone....must be so busy they didn't need my order.   I received an online survey request and happily obliged.  Manager/owner sends an email and says they never received my order and that's the reason for the mix up.  Offered a gift card, which I appreciated and declined.  I live less than 5 minutes from this store. Will not return."
0,"Not quite sure what happened the night we went. Apps came out fine but dinner was a nightmare. There were four of us dining. Two peoples pizza came out about 20 minutes after we finished the apps. It took another 45 minutes after the pizzas came out before my pasta and my wife's chicken Marsala came out. They were very apologetic and actually comped the food part of the bill. It was an unfortunate night. When the food finally did come, it was very good."
1,"This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I found a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it's good enough to have its own review.  PLUS, my gal from China Express (now closed, was downtown) cooks there, so I had to make it happen.\n\nThis place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I've ever tried is the chicken on a stick, and really, it's all I need.  these little thingers are delicious, and they're only $3.  \n\nThey have two different sauces to dump on it, and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it's wrapped in foil, and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins, as they're messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples, I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won't regret it."
0,"I tried this place again Friday for lunch.  It's still meh.\n\nThis time, we didn't sit on the patio.  The wait service was better, but it took much too long for our plates to hit the table.  Hello, it's lunch time on a Friday, and we didn't order any alcohol, that might be a clue that we've got things to do.  \n\nThe food was just OK.  The closest comparison I can think of is to El Torrito.  That's not a compliment.    \n\nI've eaten here many times over the years, and my sense is it's gone down hill.  I'll probably skip this place the next time I'm in town."
1,"Misty is the best! I usually just let her decide what to do with my hair, and it always looks great. With other stylists, I always find that I need to go home and redo my hair. But with Misty it's always soft and shiny and perfect. She is a great conversationalist too, which is super important to me. I don't even live in Las Vegas anymore, but when I come to town twice a year, seeing Misty for a new do is always on the top of my to/do list."
1,"Believe it or not, I have been to at least 2 other Pinball-specific museum/arcades. This sort of thing is not that new to me. This is probably the largest in number overall, however, and it makes an awesome break from the strip. \n\nThe pinball selection is very good- I wouldn't say great. Very, very few machines pre-1960, and an overabundance of post 1990's machines, which is a major waste to me. My biggest complaint is that they have greatly altered the price of these machines. Most pre-1960 machines were nickel, dime at most. Most 60's and 70's machines were dimes and sometimes quarters. The cheapest machines here are quarter, and some newer ones are $.75, which is more than you'd pay if you played the machine in a modern movie theater or modern arcade. I get they wanna make money for restoration but I would MUCH rather pay a $5 entrance fee and pay the original prices. The best pinball arcade I've been to doesn't charge admission and kept the original prices, so it can be done. \n\nThe non-pinball selection is pretty good but not as well maintained. Overall they don't do a very good job of noting which machines are functional and which are not; some that had no lights on were working, some with lights on were not working. Yes, this is picky but this is *the point of their business*, so I think it's kind of a big deal. The focus of the pinball is Gottlieb machines, but they do have some weird one-off machines as well. i like the little plaques that are handwritten and describe everything they know about the machine (but also use exclamation points very liberally!!) \n\nI think this is an awesome place to come soak up some AC and waste $5 over a couple of hours. Don't waste your time playing the modern pinball machines; you can do that everywhere and a lot of them aren't worth it. i had a great time playing the older, much more difficult machines. Despite the limited arcade cabinet game collection, they have some awesome selections like Spy Hunter, the original Mario Bros (not super Mario Bros, though they have that too) and some really old machines that used to be in Strip casinos. This place is a bit grungy and the employees are a mix of young and helpful and old and crotchety, but it's a great place to go at least once. You'll need a car to get here so plan accordingly, but if you come it'll be a good time."
0,"Missed the mark\n\nEasy Life Bobba is located on South Durango and West Desert Inn, inside a small little strip mall between chase bank and the Pet Hospital.\n\nStrolling in around 9pm I was surprised to see a fairly busy business. When ordering I was a little unsure of what to get as the menu is extensive with a wide range of options. You can see the time and effort that has gone into the menu which I respect.\n\nI ended up with the Strawberry Fluff with strawberries, kiwi, banana with lychee and jellies on top. I also ordered a Milk tea with Bobba for myself.\n\nI'll start by saying I had a sample of the Fluff and it wasn't to bad. As I only sampled a small amount I can't really comment to much but I will say the jelly was a little tough.\n\nAs for my milk tea, I had to throw it out. I don't like being a waste and it's very very rare I won't eat something but this wasn't even remotely good. The milk tea taste like powdered milk and the Bobba was so tough it seemed like it had been sitting out and dried up.\n\nI was thinking 3 stars, 1) open till 10pm 2) variety on the menu 3) The yelp check in offer. But the milk tea just wasn't even close to being appetizing. Now maybe it was an off night, maybe my taste buds blew a fuse but as for now, it's not really a place I want to visit again and I can't recommend it to anyone.\n\nOverall\nService: 3-5\nDrink: 0-5\nCleanliness: 4-5\nComing back: No"
1,"Service A+, decor very nice, Bul Gogi and side dishes = Phenomenal.\nCan't wait to go back. These guys know how to put out top quality Bul-Gogi! Super fresh rib-eye beef.  What a treat to have them open up a few months ago, truthfully the best Korean Food in Arizona, look no further, you will not be disappointed!"
1,"The French toast is a must. Hearty skillet a good choice, too. Can't go wrong with anything here."

0,"Carter's Babies & Kids stores have a huge selection of clothing but a little sparse on the toys and accessories. Came here to purchase gifts for my little niece and nephew and found looking through the clothes a bit overwhelming. They have some really cute stuff but you also have to weed through a lot of terrible styles and poorly illustrated items. Better-designed merchandise is obviously more expensive so you might want to wait until it goes on sale but also taking a chance that it sells out. \n\nI found that Carter's is very popular with mom's with small children, at least in my family. I had to return a few items because they were already purchased. That's what happens when you find a nice piece clothing here, there's a good chance that mom already bought it. Also not a big fan of their return policy where they have to get your mailing address. As a person without kids, I really don't wish to receive Carter's junk mail."
1,"Nice food (had the brisket yesterday...duck today), cool atmosphere. When staying at the Aria, this is a casual no-brainer."
0,"Cute decor, ok atmosphere, good location.  Sadly I have to agree with many of the other negative review points for L'avenue.  Crowded, loud, wait staff with enough snotty attitude for all of Montreal and the food was just eh.  \nSeriously, I've had my fair share of eggs Benedict in my life & theirs was nothing special & def not worth the hype & other crap you have to put up with there.  It took our waiter 45 minutes just to take our coffee order, mean while he was hanging out at the counter chatting.  Insulting.  And he refused to speak in English & said there was no English menu.  Or so we were told.  We did try to speak in French, but I find it ridiculous when EVERY other place in Montreal is more than happy to speak in English & French."
0,"Circus circus should be a great place for families because of their arcade and entertainment. However they don't deliver in the room accommodations. The carpet was horribly filthy. You can see it's mostly stained and has not been changed for 50 years. Seriously! The drainage in the shower was slow and the faucets were leaking. The bed cover/ comforter was so dirty...you could see the dust come out when you tap the bed. They had a coffee maker in the room which was the only plus, but that didn't work either. The pictures in their website looked good but man, it looks just like the opposite. I will never stay in circus circus anymore, even though they have the best entertainment for kids. We should just book somewhere else and bring them there one day."
0,"Went to try this place because it was not too far from home and we wanted a small cafe style Sunday breakfast.  When we entered we were hit with a very foul odor, but stayed in spite of it.  Our mistake... the waitress took our drink order right away but it took 15 mins to get our drinks. The coffee was the worst cup o'joe i think i have ever drank it tasted like it was made with hose water. If you live in Vegas you know our water has alot to be desired...it all needs to be filtered!  We were never offered straws and after the first bad cup of coffee was never offered a second till halfway through our breakfast. Which was awful as well it took 40 minutes with only three other tables in the place filled we only had 4 people and ordered simple breakfast items.  I had the veggie benny which was like ice cold when it finally got there, the hollandaise  was like some glob of yellow stuff atop my poached eggs...it was like a yellow goo that didnt move it was disgusting the hash browns were so cold even the salt i added just sat on top like sprinkles. Needless to say all the orders at our table were cold and bad. However the table behind us which hosted some personal friends of one of the waitresses, arrived after us and received their food in record time...and it may even have been hot who knows..and at this point who cares. When the waitress came to clear the table she asked everyone to hand her the plates and other various items on our table. God forbid she actually walk two steps to the right and get the plates herself.  We waited and never saw her again after she finally brought us the bill. So we asked one of the other 4 waitresses to please take it so we could leave.  The pictures on the wall are smeared with food and grime. The tables are sticky from not being wiped down properly and the floors were just plain filthy. We will never go back and will let everyone we know not to go as well. This place is just bad all around.  Oh yeah one last note.... one of the waitresses seemed so stoned she couldn't even concentrate on wiping a table...she was in la la land for sure. Horrible...."
1,Very nice Bellini brunch. This is truly a hidden local secret. Took my in laws and great Grammy there on a Saturday around 11am. There wasn't a whole lot people no line at all. The whole staff from the cashier girls to the servers and the manager were so so nice. Please bring some tip money to tip your bar Bellini tender especially Anne she was the nicest person ever and she makes the best drinks. If you have a rewards card up to four people gets to eat for $17.99 unlimited Bellini or soft drinks included. Of not it only $19.99 and for that price food was not bad at all. Not gourmet food but good food for a buffet. Also the atmosphere was really nice and the Resturant was clean. Beautiful decor and comfortable seating in a large space. It was totally worth it and on Saturday nights they have the same deal for a Polynesian dinner. That I will come back to try. For a local spot it is a good deal!
0,Was hoping for a better experience. The reason it gets only one star is because my pet peeve is cold food. Our whole meal was cold. Plus the key ingredient for steaks and hoagies is the roll. It was terrible. Server didn't give a rip. Won't be back.
0,"i really hate to do this, but i have to. service was slower than slow. my bagel + cream cheese was super skimpy on the cream cheese. turkey chili was lukewarm and not as good as it should have been. the staff seemed gloomy and sad. it just wasn't a good experience. it really is too bad, i haven't had lunch at a einstein's in forever and i was hoping it would be as good as i remember it."
1,The chicken fundido is excellent.  The margeuritas are delicious.  I'm not sure that I like the duck & turtle pond...it seems a little gross.  There are lots of birds on the patio so we always eat inside .
1,"My husband and I hadn't gone there in many years - no idea why, but we always seem to end up in Arrowhead restaurant row,  fighting traffic and long waits (unless we're at Cheesecake Factory which always seems to have ample tables). It was our anniversary and we decided to try a different restaurant.\n\nWe were glad we went!  On a Friday night we only had to wait about 20 minutes, which we did at the bar - just enough time to have a drink.  The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down, even though the entire bar was full (we got the last 2 seats).\n\nAbout 10 minutes after arriving, the hostess found us in the bar and asked us if we wanted a table (she could seat us then) or if we wanted to wait for a booth (we did) - instead of just dragging us to a table.  We should have requested a booth when we arrived, and forgot, so it was nice that they asked before we vacated our seats at the bar.\n\nThe food arrived in a timely manner and was terrific - great steak and lobster and, again, great prices.  We really like the fact that you can order your steak to size according to your hunger: no reason for over eating unless you want to.  The veges were cooked just right - not too crisp nor too limp. The portions were all good sized except for my baked potato.  It wasn't as large as other restaurants, but maybe that's why I had room for dessert (usually don't). \n\nFor dessert we got the sampler, figuring it would be 3 small portions. Wrong!  They were all full-size as far as I'm concerned.  We both looked at it and said, \""how are we going to eat all this?\"" (we did lol). My husband liked the carrot cake & cheesecake, and I loved the pecan fudge brownie with ice cream/whipped cream/hot fudge.\n\nLast but not least, our server was full of personality - we really liked her and tipped her accordingly...\n\nAll in all, a great night! We won't let so much time go by before visiting again."
0,"VIP Taxi has to be the worst taxi service in the valley.  You call ahead to set up a reservation only to get a call at the time you were supposed to get picked up saying that they are still working on getting a cab for you.  They don't  know the meaning of the word reservation.  If you want to be disappointed, use this company."
0,"Like always the service is great but today the food wander so great the street taco is good but is not a street taco, no salsa, no lime and flour tortillas nooo for carnitas tacos is corn, the top sirloin was great the flavor but wasn't hot just warm the ribs with no flavor like use to be why? I don't know but today the kitchen don't do a good job, sorry"
1,"Quality, Service, Class. This is properly fine dining.\n\nThey serve authentic skewers of heaven, and even the rice is good here (a lot of middle eastern restaurants overlook their rice, this was a most pleasant surprise). Service exceptional, and if you like wine the drinks are very well-priced. The beef sultani plates are exceptional, but if you are looking for somethingh different the chicken sultani is a very pleasant surprise.\n\nA perfect date place if you want to impress."
0,"They had 2 people working the lunch rush, no brainer they need at least one more.  I eat at capriottis all the time and it was my first trip to this location.   I was severely underwhelmed and my sandwich was ok at best."
1,"I have worked with many animal rescue groups over the years in the Valley. Many vets will donate their time but donated time costs money and guess what, rescue groups are big on volunteers but short on cash. University Animal Hospital has always taken on more than its fair share of abandoned and forsaken pets and returned them to the rescue groups to be readopted  with shots and a clean bill of health. They are great vets and true animal lovers."
1,"My husband & I ate here last night during our trip to Pittsburgh.  I had read online about their cheap happy hour.  We did get here an hour early but decided to sit at the bar and order anyway.  It wasn't busy at 4:00 on a Monday (but then it was rainy and windy outside).  Our bartender/server, Jorge, was just wonderful.  He was very personable and recommended items to us both.  I was going to order the fish tacos with tilapia but he said the mahi mahi tacos were better.  Indeed they were.  The homemade chips and queso were also a great starter.  They have great beer on tap and an extensive liquor selection.\n\n The restaurant is on the second floor and you can look out the windows at Market Square.  We will definitely come back on a return visit!  Another bartender recommended a breakfast place to us and we are on our way there this morning."
1,Had them move me a few days ago for the second time in two years. Both times were amazing. I went with them due to affordable price and family recommended.  They were spot on both times with flawless service. I didn't get the owner either time but his 3 man crew both times were friendly and quick and didn't harm our brand new home. clearly the only person who didn't give 5 stars so far is the competition or had a miscommunication on their end...because I got multiple followup calls and confirmations.
1,"Been eating here regularly since the resort opened back in 1999. I can't remember a time where I had any trouble except for when service might have been a tad slow with a waiter named Bill while they were really busy, but that was a few years ago. I've never had to wait in line to be seated with a Diamond Total Rewards card (Caesars Entertainment player's card), and they usually take our order and serve us first before other regular patrons. They also give a $1 discount on almost all (if not all) items with your Total Rewards card regardless of level/status. Food is average to above average and it's always comped, so I can't complain."
1,"I liked it.  Ate outside on the patio. Ordered at the counter, large assortment of sandwiches, delivered promptly to the table. Always drink water with lemon.  I'm sure if memory serves I was given water with lemon not bottled water.  Have eaten there twice and had a great sandwich each time."
0,"Decent food. Pretty good drinks. Reasonable prices. Horrible service.\n\nPros: The burger and fries were good enough to warrant a return trip. The beer selection was pretty good. Couldn't complain about the drink prices. The manager was pretty helpful, and gave me an industry discount (I'm a bartender) when he brought the check.\n\nCons: Absolutely the worst service I've had in years, by far! We sat down on the patio, where most of the other guests were, for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped. He got us some water and sent the server over. He took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks. We didn't see him again for quite a long time. I was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one. Every time the waiter was at our table, it was because the manager had told him to go there. \n I had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and I no longer had any interest in staying. Once again, the manager handled the situation very well (sending the waiter over and discounting the bill). After we had the bill, the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed. He was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book. It was really uncomfortable.  The moment the book closed, the waiter had it in his hands. He ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip. (as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15% even for crappy service. this service warranted $1 however.) \n Nobody expects incredible service in a bar. It's a real laid-back place. I do expect some service though. It is, after all, why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar, but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad, he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot, but I will be sitting at the bar if i do. The server in question was a tall red-haired male.\n \n i really liked the beer I had there too. I wish I could have bought 10 more. If only there was someone to serve them to me."
0,"DIRTY: OVERPRICED: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\n\nThis place does not seem to care if they have any customers. Its absolutely filthy, dust everywhere, the towels you rest your hands on have paint all over them as if they never get washed or replaced. The final straw for me which made me determined to leave this bad review is Jennifer used a tool to cut a hangnail off her own nails and then proceeded to use the same clipper on me without washing or even sterilizing!! right in front of me! gross! will never return\n\nalso $30 for gel manicure..."
1,"We tried the pork belly. Albondagas soup and the broccoli cheese soup. The were all very good. I did not realize the soup came in two sizes. $5 was the small. Wish I had gotten the large but I just ate some of hubbies pork belly, wishing I had ordered some of my own. Pork belly and soup were enough for a good meal unless you are a big eater."
1,I'm in Las Vegas pretty often so I'm over the whole club of the moment and  I refuse to wait in a line longer than 15 minutes.  Gallery is always easy to get into and a guaranteed good time. The drinks are pretty strong and the music is always something danceable. \n\n**Halo bar or fat Tuesday in the mall connected to the casino are fun places to pre game.
1,"Our favorite waitress is back! As is the old manager (John, I think?). They must have had an off night with a new manager subbing and it went dreadfully wrong. We decided to try it again after they introduced a reward program and were pleasantly surprised. \n\nI had one great meal (same items as last time), went back a couple of weeks later and tried something different (the Italian Classics). Delicious! However, I tried it again the following week and was disappointed. The chicken parmesan was burned. Like dark brown, bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time? It just kind of stayed on your tongue too long after taking a bite and was strangely creamy. Weird. \n\nSo I'll just stick with the calamari, sausage lentil soup and sirloin marsala. \n\nI guess I update my review to say when they are on their game, everything is fantastic, but they can really have off nights occasionally. I guess like many places."

0,"Been supporting Fat Choy since they opened but the service and food quality has been going downhill since.  Today I show up and they are completely overwhelmed by a large, self induced party of \""Eureka Warriors\"" on some breast cancer tour/run/whatever.  People were getting up and going behind the counter to get their own drink refills....it was nuts.  i told the waitress my fries were cold and she said it was because it was \""windy\""....such a wack excuse it was funny! Not coming back, I tried to support but cant do it anymore."
1,"EXCELLENT food and EXCELLENT service. I have been coming here since they opened. Usually here for the happy hour, which is incredible value for the bar food. As we know, most \""restaurants\"" in vegas suck. Not this place. Could stand up to any top mexican joint in this country. The bartenders are exceptional. Again, a rare achievement. Whoever is running this place deserves great credit for bringing quality and service to a town that greatly needs it. btw, their bathroom is immaculate!"
1,I absolutely loved this place. Adam was great. So caring about our group.was there with daughter & 3 of her friends for her 25th birthday. The appetizers all down to dessert were good. Filet was tasty and everything hot and well prepared. I can hardly wait to return.
1,"Hands down, best steak I've ever had in my life. Service was above and beyond. The recommendation for an accompanying wine with my steak was also top-notch. The place is expensive but deservedly so. If you are a steak lover, this place belongs on your bucket list. Please eat here."
1,This place has been here for years and it has been a while since I had been here so I figured I would review it.\n\nThe parking is the first thing you experience.  Be here early or be prepared to park on the street with a bit of a walk.  On a positive note...parking is free.\n\nThe place has lots of seating so if you are meeting someone there..make sure they give you their exact seating location or you could be looking for a while.\n\n\nThe beer selection is all there own an I always go with a tasty hefeweizen.  Theirs does not disappoint.  Their menu almost has too much on it IMO.  I just want to choose something quick and drink.  I ordered the turkey club.  The club came with plenty of fries and was perfect.  \n\nThe pricing I think is very fair and overall the experience was great.
1,"My first time and I LOVED it !! Great service, I actually won more $ here than at other casinos. The manager Steve Culp was on top of everything. We experienced great customer service and I had a great time. The food is so cheap and that's what we were looking for.  I highly recommend this casino. IT's a MUST if you want to have fun and forget about the facade of other fancy hotels where you wait forever for your drinks hahahha....  Seriously!"
1,Great idea for wedding favors!!!!!! Amazing customer service- you can tell this guy loves his job!!
0,"I didn't expect to see Chumlee or anything but did expect some cool antiques. I did not see any cool antiques. Kinda depressing overall, as was Vegas in general."
0,"The had a few items on the menu that mixed together Italian and Chinese cuisine. Huge Portions, Very Nice People who own the place, and very cheap for what you get. With that being said. The food itself was average. I had the Angel Hair Pasta with black been sauce. Very thin noodles, with bell peppers, onions, and chicken. The flavor was very mild, nothing really stood out, but it filled me up. I also had the Crab rangoons, 4 very big rangoons, very little crab inside (imitation and a huge amount of cream cheese, I'd say it was overpowering. If you are looking for a place to eat, and low on cash this is a great place to go. without the rangoons, it was 5$ for a the meal. You also get a house salad and a veggie egg roll. A Much better option than going to a fast food burger joint."
0,"I'm usually a huge fan of ramen, but this restaurant just did not do it for me. I ordered the Tom Yum ramen, hoping it'd have a sweet/sour soup base. However, the ramen soup was really salty and tasteless at the same time. I didn't even know this was possible. Unfortunately, instant ramen tasted better than what I had. Definitely won't be coming back again!"
0,WOOOOOOOW.   sometimes the smallest problems are made waaay bigger by AWFUL service.  love the place and the food was ... yea ok... but the place was quarter full... tons of empty tables and man we had to get up and ask for stuff from anybody we could find.   not going to review the food because at least for us... if the service isn't there... we'll pass.   Hope you all have better luck.
0,"Dear Tanzy,\n\nToday you sadly disappointed in the service you provided. I spoke so very highly of your brunch buffet with unlimited mimosas, but sadly things did not go as planned. \n\nLet me start by saying that although the day ended not as planned, all of your staff were quite nice, very friendly, and extremely apologetic. I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story) .  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.  This should have been our queue as to what was to come.\n\nFast forward to around 11:30 and the rest of our party finally arrived. Everyone was happy to so each other and Kevin came by to offer the unlimited mimosas and again let us know that he and another waiter would be taking care of us. Cool. 10 mins later we are ready to order and regretfully our waiters are no where to be found. 20 mins go by and we are still waiting for our waiters so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiters were and the hostess herself graciously came over to take our orders. But then we wait, and wait, and wait. We see other tables that came in after we did, get served there meal, eat, and leave. We even asked a party that was across from us, who came in at the same time that we did, if they had even ordered yet as they appeared to be waiting just as long as were were. An hour and 15 mins later ( not kidding) we finally say we are done. I go and look for our waiter and say please cancel our order because we are leaving. \n\nThe manager comes out and apologies and comps our drinks but we were still disappointed. I am not sure what happened today but after speaking your praises   you let me down as well as all my girlfriends. Will I be back? Maybe but it will be awhile. Seriously  Tanzy, you dropped the ball today.\n\nLove, \nEbony\n\nPS Bring back that yummy buffet please!\n\nUpdate 11.12.12: I received a phone call and an email from the General Manager Michael  today. WOW! Thank you for both the call and email. You went above and beyond what I expected. For that I give you 5 stars ( but I won't change the stars on this particular review) But again just wow, thank you!!! See I told you guys that the staff was great! :)"
0,"Honesty, I would want to give this place 1 star...but the Excalibur buffet is worse...which automatically bumps this place up to two stars....but let me tell you....it a VERY low 2 stars. NOTHING was exciting about this buffet. I do feel like I need to provide at least one positive thing, however the only positive thing I can think of is the seating arrangement. The seating is arranged so that it is not so \""Cafeteria style\"". IDK if thats so much of a positive but that is the best I could do. \n\nThe food is bland, not seasoned well. Plain boring \""Comforter food\"". Waaaaaaaay over priced for the food they provide. I paid $38 for the all you can eat day pass, but will NEVER do that again. It is NOT a deal if you don't like the food and don't eat it. I tried a little bit of everything (My buffet ritual) But I literally took one bite and put it down and moved to the next. I honestly don't remember taking more than one bite of anything. It was gross.  I went to McDonald's an hour later and had the best meal I had that day. And I don't even eat McDonald's. Ok so perhaps I'm being a little harsh....but to be honest, you can pay that same exact price to eat at the Wicked Spoon (BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP, Don't believe yelp it)  anyways like I was saying, you can pay the same price, and eat like a Queen or King until you are stuffed!! And you still will want to eat because EVERYTHING is so tasty, you'll be so stuffed you won't need to eat for the rest of the day. ( At least that is what happened to me on several occasions) There fore, you are pretty much paying the same price for the days worth of food, but with a better experience. \\\n\nBut bottom line, even if I were to get a free pass for this buffet, I would probably try to sell it to a foolish person for $5, take that and go put it in a slot machine. I wouldn't eat this food again if it were free, now, if I were starving...maybe...but then again,  it's Vegas...no such thing as starving....so nope...won't be eating here again EVER. \n\n\nBLAH"
0,"Heard a lot of great things about this place and finally decided to check it out. It's located in an odd spot in one of Vegas's older strip malls... if you're dining here at night you're in for an adventure, there's definitely a lot of unique neighbors. I came here on a Thursday night at 8:45pm with two of my friends. They were pretty busy but not packed and we were able to get seated immediately.\n\nIt was an interesting place; in the middle of the restaurant they had a huge wine selection concealed behind a glass wall. Additionally like a lot of popular asian restaurants there always seems to be more Americans than asian patrons. \n\nAnyways... after we were seated our server Jim, (I don't think that was his real name), was a phenomenal guy. He must have been working there for a while because he knew everything and anything about the menu! Jim made some great recommendations from the menu and always checked back to see if we were doing fine. \n\nWe ended up ordering quite a bit of food, but my favorites were #14. Nam Kao Tod, which was rice flavored with lemon, it was very savory and #13B Moo Dad Dew, which was the best beef jerky I've ever had.\n\nOverall it wasn't a bad experience. I would rate this place 3/5 but we ended up finding hair in the drunken rice and that was an immediate red flag. Especially the way the server had handled the issue. Our other server, (not Jim), wasn't even sure how to go about it. His first response was to bring us a new plate; we pretty much had to send back the entire dish until they removed it from our check.\n\nWe ended up spending $44 for 3 people. (That was after the drunken rice was taken off of our bill).\n\nLotus of Siam is definitely your typical mom & pop shop, there were handwritten \""out of order signs\"" on paper place mats near the restrooms and you could clearly see the cleaning supplies in the restroom. Also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded, there's tables randomly scattered everywhere. You can literally place your arm on someone else's table if your not careful!\n\nTips: This place is a bit overhyped, the food isn't bad but it's like any other traditional Thai restaurant just with more reviews."
0,"So, I feel like a complete idiot for getting sucked in by Winder Farms a second time. Too many extra fees, you have to babysit the delivery man and accounting for credits due, overpriced milk, bread and produce that never lasts until the expiration date, and of course the small print in the contract that requires 40 deliveries before cancellation or a $50+ cancellation fee. It doesn't seem like a big deal until you realize what a waste of money it all is and find yourself skipping every delivery. You are better off buying your milk and bread at Trader Joes or Fresh & Easy and your produce at the farmers' market."
0,"Not all that.\n\nThis joint has some of the best reviews short of Joel Robuchon but the fact is it's not much more than a glorified protein-buffet. The quality of meat is far from Prime; the salad bar is not bad; the wine list is fair; the service is acceptable. But overall, nothing outstanding. And for close to the same price you could get a great piece of meat at Envy or Joe's.\n\nThis a good example of being careful not to take Yelp reviews as food-gospel...including this review."
1,"I had been to Snooze in Boulder, CO and fell in love, so when they opened one here I was shocked! I love the atmosphere and the staff are always friendly. I've had the Sandwich I Am, the Breakfast Burrito and the heaping mound of hash browns and cheese that you get to add toppings to ( I chose chorizo and onion). Every item I have been thoroughly impressed with. So good. \nThe only downfall to this place is they need to expand or open more locations because the wait time is ridiculous, even on weekdays. But, I guess that just shows how good the food is. Also, a huge disappointment for me is their coffee! How can you have such delicious food and such terrible coffee? They even have a great back story to the coffee and it still tastes bad. The location In boulder had good coffee so I'm not sure where the disconnect is."
1,My uncle owned a restaurant nearby since the 70's and I remember Sugar Bowl being here for the longest time. I'm glad that it has withstood the test of time and I consider it a historical landmark now. It looks like an old ice cream and soda store from the 50's and 60's. I've always liked the ice cream here and try to make it a stop every time I come to Scottsdale. \n\n\nVisited June 2012
0,"Having been to Penn Brewery a few times lately and them having a groupon available, I invited 2 couples out for dinner.  \n\nFirstly, they sat us directly next to a band making it impossible to hear each other and the waitress. \n\nSecond, although the food was mostly as good as before, the portions were much smaller than what we've had in the past with the same prices.  This was a big let down.\n\nLastly, we had 3 couples, 3 separate checks and they would only let us use 1 groupon for the entire table.  I understand this is in the fine print but this is the only reason we came even came here to eat.  Never experienced this problem before with groupons.\n\nNow we have to come back to use them, I'm sure that will be the last time."
1,"The steaks at Arrowhead Grill are top notch! Celebrating our 5 year anniversary with family, the service was great and the food was filling and well worth it. I liked the family style sides which were all pretty good such as green beans, truffle cauliflower and grilled artichokes. I had a 8oz filet Mignon, it was buttery and spiced well, and a nice glass of red wine.  Yum! I would definitely go back!"
1,"Banh Mi - Vietnamese sub sandwiches, via French baguette (yum!)\n\nPlace - small, tight, only two tables for seating area. If you need a place to sit and eat your sandwiches, you can sit on the bench, outside the shop by the non operable water, by the fountain. \n\nFood - the banh mi #11 is good (steam pork meat). This time, I got #12 which is the same as #11, but longer, almost a foot. I normally don't like p\u00e2t\u00e9, but with my Vietnamese sandwich, I had to have with it.  It just enhances the flavor of the sandwich, with their beurre (lard) --yummm!! They do a good job with the sandwiches here, it brings me close to home in Houston. \n\nService - they can be quick as can be. The only gripe I have is that they do not take sugar cane orders, 30 minutes before closing!  I thought they close at 6:30pm, but the hours now is that they close at 6:00pm daily. Cash only, no exceptions -- had to go to an ATM."
0,"So...BInkley's was all puffed up with not much to show for it.  WE heard amazing things but our experience felt like being ripped off by the finest con artists out there. The waiters have a great script and the emphasis on the little micro treats between courses doesn't make up for the microscopic portions of this \""tasting menu\"".  We hold as our standard for a tasting menu Barbara Lynch's Mentons in Boston.  While each of their portions are elegantly small, there's more than one bite. What irritated me most was the waiters fine monologue about the merits of Japanese Cobe beef which justified a 17 dollar surcharge on an already expensive menu.  When it arrived, it was delicious but I fight to make it more than one bite. Forget the theatrics Binkley's.  People want to feel fed and nurtured after a meal, not conned.  This chef has great technical acumen but NO HEART. If you're hungry, steer clear of BInks!"
1,"WING NIGHT ~ Wahoo!!! \n\nI did not used to be much of a wing fan, however that has changed over the last couple years. Now I very much enjoy good wings. Native New Yorker has a great Salt and Pepper dry rub that I am obsessed with. The wings are good sized, crispy, flavorful and not greasy (or) to messy. There is a hint of garlic on the Salt and Pepper wings that makes them just that much better. If you go for Tuesday night .35 cent wings just be prepared to wait for a table, it gets a little crazy trying to find a place to sit. But for the price and the quality it is worth it! \n\n(Their Medium sauce is good, it has a little kick but it does not burn your mouth. So if you like sauce on your wings but don't like to sweat then go with the medium.)"
1,"amazing food, great service, walk out happy."
1,"The DawgFather Grill is just around the corner from my office, so it was only a matter of time until I decided to go check it out.\n\nWhen I first went there, the woman behind the corner surprisingly didn't seem all that enthused about the hot dogs, so I took her advice and got the philly cheesesteak sandwich. It was ok, but I didn't really think it was all that great. As such, I resolved to actually try a hot dog the next time I came.\n\nWhen I next visited, I ordered one of their big dawgs (1/4 lb angus beef) with all the toppings (ketchup, mustard, onions, relish, and shredded cheese). I also ordered a normal-sized version of one of their Jersey dawgs, which is deep fried and has only mustard on it.\n\nSummary: The Big Dawg was simply delicious, and perfectly matched my definition of a good hot dog. The Jersey Dawg was ok, but the normal-sized hotdog just seemed ridiculously thin in comparison to the Big Dawg... so do yourself a favor and only ever order the Big Dawg size.\n\nOne downside: If you are traveling south on Central, this place can be a bit of a pain to get to since you have to do a u-turn at the next intersection (just to get over the light rail). If you're going north on Central, however, it's super-easy to drop in real quick, grab a hotdog, and head on your merry way."
1,"The place was a bit tough to find, but we eventually found it. It's inside the O'Aces, as the previous reviewer stated. I went with a coworker around noon and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Although it's inside O'Aces, it did feel like a separate establishment. The decor was nice and it felt like an actual restaurant, not a sports bar or dive bar. There were three small flat screens spread throughout the walls of the dining room on various sports channels, so that was a plus for me since I'm a huge sports fan.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. She was attentive to when we needed drink refills and took it upon herself to give us refills before we had to ask. I had the stromboli and my coworker had the chicken fingers. Not the best stromboli I've ever had (that honor goes to Four Kegs), but it was really good. The portion size was good, and came with a side of marinara for dipping. The chef also came out to ask us how the food was. I thought that was a nice touch.\n\nThe prices were fairly reasonable, but we used Groupon Now vouchers, so it ended up being a great deal. They had no problem with us using two vouchers for one table. Some places limit Groupon usage to one per table, but not here.\n\nPaparazzi Grill is definitely a place I will return to."
1,"BJ's is always a great place to go eat, and drink if you choose.. Always great service.\nNice menu, popular prices. Lots of TV's.  Love their burgers,. Soup and Salad a greart deal. Salads great,  Just enjoy BJ's.   A solid value. What more can one ask for,"
0,"We (3 in our party) stopped in to Roland's while in the lively and interesting Strip District. We placed our drink and food selections with the waitress. She brought our soups, which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls. All were absolutely delicious. The lobster bisque actually had lots of pieces of lobster and the onion soup rich, beefy taste with lots of onions. The clam chowder had tons of clams and the portion was large enough for a meal!!! Our shrimp appetizers ...fried shrimp and shrimp cooked in a beer broth were excellent. Unfortunately our server had no clue how to actually serve people in a restaurant...we had to ask 3 times for napkins and when they were finally brought to the table, she acted as if she was doing us a Big Favor. Then after our food was brought to the table and we asked multiple times for eating utensils. The first time we asked her we were polite, then asked another server, then when we asked at the hostess stand we were told \""oh we told your waitress to bring them\"". When she finally brought them to our table she said \""if you had asked nicely I would have brought them sooner\"". Can you believe that!!! The floor manager came over and while he apologized, also made excuses for her confrontational behavior. \n5 stars for food and food prep, 0 stars for rude service or lack of service."
0,"I went here for my friend's sister's bachelorette party. The service was alright, nothing special. She was quick to refill the drinks. Overall, there's nothing about this place that made me want to come back.\n\nI split the spinach and artichoke dip with my friend. When we got it, it was basically soup or some sort of baby food. Some of the chips were kind of stale. Just meh kinda food. We also got an order of garlic fries which were totally under cooked. \n\nLike I said, nothing really stood out to me or gave me a reason to come back. Maybe it was just an off night."
0,"BEWARE!!  I read some bad reviews about this hotel on another site and thought maybe it would be okay anyway.  Initially, it was an acceptable place to stay but not a place I would stay again because it was dirty.  But then we had a terrible customer service experience on top of that and I would never recommend this hotel to even an enemy.\n\n1. Bad customer service at the desk: We made reservations online for 4 days and on the 2nd day, we went to the front desk to change our credit card.  The manager at the front desk asked if we were checking out and we said no, we were not scheduled to check out for two days.  She kept telling us \""This is a pre-paid hotel.  If you don't pay in advance, we can't guarantee the rooms.\""  I told her that the web site has no mention of that and the person who checked us in did not tell us that.  The she said she didn't have any rooms for us and we would have to leave.  I asked what the point of a reservation was if they couldn't keep it and she continued to say several times \""This is a pre-paid hotel...\""  At that point, we went upstairs to pack our stuff and try to find other arrangements.  I was getting ready to call corporate customer service when she called and said she made a mistake and we had the room for the next two days.  She was extremely rude during the experience and she was the manager.\n\n2. General carelessness and more bad customer service at the desk: The maid left the door to our room ajar and not locked.  This was a room on the main level next to one of the open exits to the parking lot (the hotel has an open-air design where the rooms open to the the outdoors).  When we called down to the front desk, the personnel there said \""Oh well.\""\n\n3. Dirty.  The hot tub and pool had slimy stuff on the tiles.  There were broken beer bottles and cigarettes all over the ground by the garbage cans.  Everything else including the rooms were dingy.  We had a non-smoking room but it smelled like a smoking room with perfumey air freshener.\n\n4. The continental breakfast is listed as free but it costs 4.99 plus tax and it is the breakfast you get for free at equivalent hotels in the area."
1,"As a sushi fan on a budget, this place hit the spot. Attentive but not overbearing staff turn out plates of sushi faster than you can fill your sake cup. Pages of special rolls that go beyond the typical Philly Roll and Spider Roll. \n\nWe ordered the Bonsai Dinner which included: \n\n*2 Special Rolls - Thumbs up for the Widow and Kamikaze Roll (smoked salmon? heavenly.)\n*TEN! pieces of Nigiri- no substitutions from the menu but the chef gave us top notch fishies\n*Seaweed Salad \n\nAlong with a large Asahi and hot sake our bill was under $60. A much better deal than the ever increasing prices of All-You-Can-Eat on every corner of this sinful city."
0,"Club is completely over crouwded, they herd you like cattle,, even if you have bottle service, which for 10 people was 4k. They dont treat you oike anytihng special,, My husbands credit card had a problem with a hold because the fruad department fladded it from him using it so much,, even after the vip host talked ont he phone with his bank, she still did not let us get even 1 bottle to start our night.. we all just sat at out over crowded 4k table desperately needing a drink, We all finally got fed up and left, the next day his card had been swiped so many times by this place even after we left from the frustration. They could not of been less accomidating. Nightmare of a place,, the music was very nice and an awesome sound syste,m though. They need to filter the amount of people in there and work on the guest relations."

It's so bad you have to love it. Open 365 days a year (yes, they are even open Christmas Day) this is a bar you can get falling down, pee on a cop car drunk for under 10 bucks. Don't EVEN ask for a fancy shmancy drink here, odds are they won't know how to make it. This is your atypical steel city shot and a beer bar, enter at your own risk, you have been warned."
0,"Average for the strip, which unfortunately is pretty poor. \n\nDecor: typical higher end for strip restaurant. Sushi bar area and lounge area in addition to dining and area. \nDress: Casual\nQuality: Cut and appearance is above average.\nPrice: High end ($50 per person, not including drinks)\nFood: Other than presentation, the food is exceedingly average in taste which is unfortunate. Normally I've give it two stars, but for the price I have to drop it to one. \nThe only bright spot was the dessert.  Excellent presentation and flavorful. \nStaff: Some appear a bit clueless, others are very attentive."
1,"My friends and I came here for lunch after a long night of partying at Rain Nightclub. This place was introduced from a buddy, Davis Duong (master yelper), he chose this place because it had the highest rating on yelp...figures. The place had great parking (lots of spots) and was very average in size, it could probably fit about 25 people max? \n\nThe price for the pho was around $7. Now the portion wise, it was pretty decent. It doesnt compare to the OC/Westminster/Garden Grove money-proportion, but for Vegas, it was pretty good. The food was delicious, didnt seem like it had too much MSG (usually i knock out from food coma after a bowl). The soup wasnt too heavy, and the noodles werent too soft and mushy. My favorite part of the bowl was the meat...the meat tasted especially good here for some reason. Even though I only had one bowl, when I really wanted 2, this place is my favorite so far in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nGreat Service, the lady who worked at the cash register even told me that a lot of customers found out about this place from yelp.\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^"
1,"On our first date, my boyfriend and I were talking about foie gras and about a restaurant in Montreal that made Foie Gras Poutine. I was like \""I know that place-- Au Pied Du Cochon, and I've been dying to go!\"" to which he replied \""Okay, let's go!\"".\n\nSix months later we were living together and took our first trip together to Montreal. Naturally, Au Pied du Cochon was on our dance card!\n\nNow, the first time we went, the service and food were all great. We had the Foie Gras Croquemensis, the Poutine, Codfish fritters and the Duck in a Can. Admittedly, a heavy meal for the end of July, but we enjoyed. The presentation was stupendous and I couldn't get over how much foie gras was on the poutine!! A nap afterwards is mandatory.\n\nThe second time we went this past August, the service was not so hot. Our server wasn't able to explain the menu or specials very well. This skill is more like a necessity at APDC because of the nature of the menu items (many of them contain organs and culinary preparations that are not common to all diners) and also because of the language barrier. Even the English menu has a lot of French on it. So it helps to have a server who is well versed in his culinary terminology and can dole out a few recommendations. sadly, this guy could not. And I really felt bad for him. I'm a server, too, so I know that people have off nights and sometimes things are just crazy and it can be hard to present things well when everything is going haywire around you. He did mean well. \n\nBut all was not well in Pig-Land this night...\n\nThe food and the presentation of it left much to be desired this time around. The poutine was slopped on the plate with streaks of gravy all over the edge that no one had bothered to wipe and all the food appeared crowded or simply thrown on the plate. Originally, I had ordered the sweetbreads they had on special, but they ran out as soon as my order was placed so I opted for the liver, which was cooked well and delicious. But things just weren't up to the same standard as they were the first time we were there.\n\nI'm still giving then 4 stars for the wonderful time we had before. But taking off one star overall. I know that they can do better. APDC is an iconic place and we made our way there as a happy couple after some first date banter about foie gras. Hopefully, if we go back again, I can add that extra star and make it a 5!"
1,"This place is quite good! I haven't ate many times there, but when I do it's typically brunch. The coffee is delicious and... \n\nBest Tip About This Place: Guinness with Espresso Shots!! BEST THING ON THE MENU!!\n\nA small drawback to the breakfast menu: no oatmeal, no english muffins."
0,"My wife and I have lived in Madison for 6 years now and we are certified foodies...eating out in Madison-area restaurants 4,5...even 6 times a week...rarely have we both experienced worse food than what we did here...one snowy afternoon.\n\nWe started with Tom Yum soup, which was pretty good, actually. But that's it!\n\nI had the curry squash with chicken which everyone seems to love and my wife had the ginger chicken....the taste of the sauce was at best worth 3 stars...but the chicken was probably a week or so old..and I have no idea what they did to it when they cooked it...but after one bite, neither of us touched it again...my wife actually had to to spit it out on a napkin coz she would have had 2 puke otherwise. The ginger chicken had enough ginger in it to make the Gingerbread man feel repulsed!\n\nWe barely ate half of what was given to us...mostly the sauce and veges and politely declined boxes for the rest."

I hope the food was good but the atmosphere was not welcoming for us to try, so we left..."
1,"Wowza! Cool place - decor is different - upscale but not by too much if that makes sense. Interesting cocktails. We had a recommended appetizer by our server / corn relish with dip fritos. We then split a burger (because it was late) - burgers are a la carte $8 I believe but OMG simply the best burger I've had in a long time! It had some sort of pimento cheese,bacon, and pepper jelly....not totally sure what that is nor do I care because I can't stop thinking about how good that was! We were in Madison for 5 days and this was my favorite. Can't wait to go back!"
0,"This place is just GROSS!  Dirty floors, tables, bathrooms, and dirty food.  I should know better, the B health rating is clearly posted so all the gamblers can see their odds if they decide to eat there.

1,Ordered food from my room for direct pick-up at Frank & Albert's in the hotel lobby and received excellent customer service.  Very friendly staff and excellent food.  Highly recommended.
0,"If there was a 0 star rating for for my experience at this location I would have chosen it! The clerk JEFF offered horrible customer service. He even refused to give us a refund and then called metro because we demanded one. All I can say is that there are so many people who are unemployed. This night clerk who claims that he is the manager of the store does not value his job. I did not give them my business and never will again. He blurted racist comments and stated that \""ain't gonna loose his job because of this\"". Horrible way to make a business work. Jeff who said his name was Peter, should be retrained in the value of a customer and customer service Period! Bad business. Shame on you 711 for employing someone that treats your \""valued guests\"" in that manner. Shame on the night clerk Jeff for being so rude and offensive. Shame on you!!!!! I give this location a zero star rating."
1,Love love this place. I have been here so many time i can't recall. Frist time was with my boyfriend. Tend to be a bit crowded some time. The service is always quick and they make super good coffee and the cakes/muffin/tart are always so good. I always look forward on trying new dessert.
0,Normally very happy with this place but came here for Mother's Day.  16 people. Made reservations using open table for 7:15. It's now 8:50 and still don't have food yet. Very unhappy. They obviously overbooked and couldn't handle it.
1,"I'm very pleased with my tattoo. This is my 8th tattoo and my first with any color and shading. I've always wanted one as such but wanted to make sure I went to a good place. Zoo was an excellent artist and I'm in love with my tattoo. The place is clean, and all of the staff are friendly. Instead of getting a drunken tattoo on the Strip somewhere, head over to these guys and you'll be happy with the results the next day."
1,The hotel rooms are big like where you can have a small party in the room. The beds are soft and comfy. Casino is cool. A good variety of restaurants. I enjoyed staying there.
1,"I love this place.  Everyone who works there remembers my name.   Not just me, seems like they know all the customers by name- even when I call, they know it's me.  Everyone is polite and friendly, and they do fast but fabulous work.  The salon is clean and new too.  I pay $30 for a french shellac that lasts for a month no matter which person is helping me.  They heat the lotion used for manis and pedis which is wonderful, especially in the winter!  I would absolutely recommend this nail salon to anyone who is looking for a place to be a regular- plus they have the best prices in town.  Side note: be prepared to pay the credit card processing fee of about 3% if you use plastic.  This isn't a big deal for me because I love this place and want them to stay in business! I never used to regularly get my nails done, but with the invention of shellac and this salon, I think I'm hooked."
0,"Having lived in cities with amazing dim sum, I am pretty desperate to find a place here in Phoenix I could go to. This was not a good first attempt....\n\nWe went to dim sum on a Thursday lunch around 1:45pm. \n\nThere was only one cart. The woman said there was usually one more cart with the fried stuff, but they weren't running it at this time. So normally there would be 2. I thought, not a good start but it's ok I mainly like the steamed dim sum anyway. We got everything they had in the cart excluding short ribs and beef balls, which I typically don't order anyways. Here's what we had:\n\nSiumai - no shrimp, spongy and bloated,  weird tasting. When you cut into it, it was colorless--just this pale brown blob. It tasted like...nothing? It was the weirdest thing. I had to ask for chili sauce just to have a flavor.  I swear you can judge a place's dim sum by their siumai--it's the staple dish! So of course everything else followed suit.\n\nBean Curd Wrap -- Isn't this supposed to be filled with seafood and vegetables? Easily unwrappable in a light broth? Nope. More colorless pork. The sauce it was in was CONGEALED. Like a weird gravy. \n\nMa Tsang -- This sticky rice wrap was probably the best part of the dim sum. It seemed over-steamed though. When I unwrapped it, the rice just slid out, and it was overly moist. Usually when you unwrap one, you gotta scrape it off the leaf. The flavors were there at least. I had a bone in mine though. But other than that I could at least manage to enjoy it.\n\nChicken feet -- Overboiled skin and not very flavorful sauce. worst part is one of them still had the NAILS on. I definitely did not want to see that.\n\nChar Shiu Bao -- The bun had a good texture. The char siu filling seemed candied and overly sweet and the pork was dry.  \n\nMeh."

I realized Southwest had a flight for half the price but it was too late to switch it due to cancellation fees. \n\nThe airplane was gross. The seats were a hard plastic and dirty. Luckily half of the plane was empty so I got to sit in the row by myself. What concerned me the most however was the noise of the plane before it took off and after it landed. It was this clicking/breaking/ scratching noise and it sounded like the plane was going to break down. I was concerned about this when we took off and am glad to have landed safely. I would not fly this airline again."
0,"This was by far the worse meal we had in Charlotte during our visit.  We came for Sunday breakfast.  There aren't a lot of places open for breakfast at 9:30 so our options were limited.  Although reservations were recommended there were some empty tables inside when we arrived.  We were told there would be about a 30 minute wait and that was just about spot on.\n\nWe were seated outside which wasn't terrible considering the street traffic was really light and it wasn't incredibly hot out.  Our servers quickly greeted us and brought out a bottle of water and coffee.  For our meal selection, hubby chose Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and I chose their Harvest Breakfast- 2 eggs, sausage, toast and potatoes.  After waiting for 25 minutes, I had drank all my coffee and our food still hadn't arrived.  Finally, our food arrived via another server and my hubby's plate was WRONG!  He received sausage instead of the pulled pork he requested. I suggested taking it back but we were so hungry that we didn't want to wait.  My coffee was topped off eventually.  We quickly ate, asked for our check and left.  \n\nIt felt like we had been forgotten about.  If I remember correctly there were 5 2-top tables outside and the other server came out frequently and even asked if we needed anything and we weren't seated at her table. They were busy inside but that is no excuse to not even visit your tables outside; we are paying guests as well.    It was very disappointing.  I don't know when we will be returning to Charlotte but we won't be returning to Harvest Moon."
0,"Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again."
1,"I've been to Times Square many times.  Always great food & great service. I was disappointed tonight though.  I was trying to keep it light since we were eating late so I ordered the dinner salad (always good) & the crab cakes from the appetizer menu.  I should have changed my mind when our server said the crab cakes were good but they were the only item on the menu not house made.  Unfortunately the crab cakes were AWFUL.  They were mushy, definitely not fresh.  They are so NOT representative of the rest of the food served in this restaurant!  If they can't make them fresh, then they should remove them from the menu.  On a good note, my husband got the clams & linguine and it was delicious!   We'll be back, but surely will not get the crab cakes."
0,"My wife and I have been going to Houston's for about 5 years, as time goes bye Houston's service/ food has really taken a back seat to the quality food/service we were used to. The last two times for dinner my wife and I love the prime rib French dip we were told both times they were sold out of the prime rib, so we opted for the Hawaiian steak(yuk) ask for medium rare it was over cooked n the taste was awful, as we were choking down the Hawaiian steak we watched waiter after waiter serving the same prime rib French dip to customers after we have almost finished are dinner, The service the last two times there has been just terrible, I know I won't be back, to all u Houston lovers enjoy, but don't settle for less like I did, Houston's has gone down hill, peace, John"
1,Broke down and they were honest and straight forward and showed me what broke in my car. I recommend them highly.
0,"I went here today after all the rave reviews and comments from my friends. First impressions: to start out, it's located in a business center. There is only a very little sign on the side walk with their name. With the interesting choice of location, comes with a very small, cramped and confusing restaurant. When we walked in to the door I was so confused. Along the window is a bar to sit and wait and I wasn't sure where to start. There was not a single seat in the house. We didn't even stay to look at the menu. Next time I will order ahead and take my food to go. If I ever do go back. It wasn't a very welcoming or comfortable environment at all. I'm very disappointed."
1,"Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting d\u00e9cor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.\n\nWhen I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. \n\nShogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a \""secret menu\"" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. \n\nUnlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  \n\nIf you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.\n\nThere used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. \n\nKyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.\n\nI love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in \""Goodfellas\"" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is \""Omakase\"" and they take care of everything for me. \n\nI've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world."
0,"Living in the southwest, this place is far out of the way.  With a groupon in hand and a day off to burn, I took off way up there.  The place seemed nice enough, so I walked in and waited 10 minutes to be greeted at the host(ess) stand.  I seriously considered making a reservation over the phone just to see if someone would walk towards the front of the place.\n\nWhen the waitress arrived out of breath, she seated me near the back next to the kitchen to wait again. 5 minutes later, I ordered a glass of wine.  She runs over and gets it from the bar and dumps it in my glass.  And I do mean dump... like it went up the side of my glass and over spilling on the table.  She didn't notice because she wasn't looking then ran off to the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, she took my order.  Twenty minutes later bread with a side of oil and vinegar came out.  Thirty minutes later, my caprese salad came out.  How on earth it takes 50 minutes to make a caprese salad I will never know. 25 minutes later, my soup came out.  I'm pretty sure this was pre-made and ladled into my bowl with again makes me wonder how on earth it took so long.\n\nAfter I finished the soup, I honestly wasn't full, but didn't want to wait 20-40 minutes for something that was actually cooked.\n\nI will give them an a star for the food being edible and an additional for having a decent cab franc by the glass.\n\nMinus a star for a careless customer service.  Minus a star for an insane wait times.  Minus a star for a stained white table cloth (eww).\n\nSomehow, I feel like 2 stars in generous."
0,"WORST SERVICE EVER.. \nThis one's for you IRVING (waiter of the night)!\n\n30-40 minutes to even get noticed (yes we timed him)??? Very unacceptable!!! No apologies, only a butt-hurt attitude to add the \""cherry on top\""..\n\nWhat really set me off is...\nIt is FREEZING in the restaurant, all I asked for was miso soup.. Had to order it twice, almost a 50 min wait for MISO SOUP, and again... Even after the issue was brought up kindly-- no apologies ...\n\nEven the guy refilling the waters was more attentive than IRVING..\n\nHow frustrating for something that could've easily been fixed ..."
1,Be sure to get your snow BRM style which comes with a scoop of ice cream at the bottom.
1,These guys are the best! I'm always coming to them in a panic because I need something printed right away. They are very helpful and their pricing is better than most places in Vegas.
0,"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced. \n\nI also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, \""natural\"" fries of the sort served here. \n\nI can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup. \n\nI would rank the burger places around mill as:\n1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries\n2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat\n3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries\n4) Five Guys,\n5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"
0,"I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""meat,\"" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""amazing.\""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades."
0,"I am actually writing this review having gotten off the plane after travelling for 12 hours (when the flight should've been more than half that time) on my first and only encounter with Spirit Airlines. I totally regret not having read the reviews before booking my flight - cheap fares are definitely too good to be true with this airline.\n\nEmbarked on a flight from Las Vegas to La Guardia (NYC) airport, via stopover in Detroit.\n\nFound out a few hours before my flight departed that there was a charge for carry-on and check-in luggage - $100 at the gate if you don't buy it beforehand! Daylight robbery. So I paid $40 for my carry-on, but when I arrived at the airport asked if this could be refunded as my luggage fit inside the 'test' compartment at check-in. The service attendant basically waved me away and told me I'd have to pay as it was 'outside the dimensions'. Whatever. \n\nDeparture time was 8.12am. After arriving at the airport 2 hours before the flight departure time, and upon arrival at the gate we were told that the flight was potentially overbooked and that they were seeking volunteers to take a later flight. This was the first scare. However the flight ended up departing approximately on time. Too good to be true? Read on.\n\nArrived in Detroit for a 'brief' stopover. Original time of departure was meant to be 4pm. Passengers were told nothing and it was only until I checked the departure screen that there was now a 2 hour delay, scheduled for 6pm! Went back to the lounge and then was told that the flight would be departing at 5.15pm - no reason was given for the delay.\n\nAll passengers boarded for an anticipated 5.15pm departure. It was only when we were all seated and waiting in the tarmac that the captain decided to tell us that La Guardia airport was closed due to bad weather in NYC. Funny though, that a fellow passenger called out that her friend was departing on a Delta plane at the same time and on the same flight leg, yet her flight was not delayed? The attendant did not seem to know how to respond to this. She called the captain and the captain's best line was that the weather was bad and was causing delays everywhere. Not sure if this was true but after reading MANY negative reviews about Spirit on Yelp, it seems that this is not the first time they have acted dishonestly and used the weather as an excuse for their sloppy practices.\n\nTo top this off, we were then told we could not disembark the plane (since we didn't know if our flight would actually depart due to the so-called weather problems in NYC) and if we chose to do so, would not be able to re-board! The attendant also let us know that Spirit would not be giving out free snacks or water for the delay, and that they would have to 'seek permission from the company first.' What the hell!? This was now beyond a joke. In my entire experience of flying, I have never encountered such unprofessional level of service by an airline. I don't understand how this company is still in business! \n\nAfter waiting on the tarmac, we finally found out at 6.30pm we were able to fly. We landed in NYC at 8.15pm, nearly 3 hours later than the original arrival time of 5.45pm. \n\nIf we really want to stop this airline running altogether, I'd suggest lodging a complain with DOT. I even Googled it and there's an actual website on how to shut down Spirit Airlines!! Check here: http://www.spiritairlinesfacts.com/how-to-shut-down-spirit.html\n\nNever flying this airline again!"
0,"No it's not planned correctly. Layout, restaurants, stores, design, water fountain, all wrong,\nJust look at The Grove LA ..You will see how inviting it is but not the Linq..\nNeed to redo, why didn't you make it just like the Grove?"
0,"You can do much better than Bartolotta in Las Vegas.\nI go to a lot of restaurants and usually do not write reviews but I had to say at least something about this one.\nIt's a very expensive restaurant so my expectations were very high. I went there with a couple of guys from work and each of us had an appetizer, some fish and a drink or two. While appetizers were good, the food was not worth the prices. I am pretty sure my mother-in-law prepares fish better and your mother-in-law probably does too. \nUnfortunately, I don't remember all the dishes we ordered but I clearly remember walking out of a restaurant with a total bill of $380 for 3 of us.\n\nOn a positive side the staff was nice and a learned a lot about fancy Italian fish."
1,The whole staff is awesome about always accommodating me and my girls' needs. The Dr. takes his time to explain what he thinks and what he would do if it were his own doggie. My girls love being boarded there. Thank You Ark for always going above and beyond what is expected! I really recommend this place!
1,"Pei Wei is fast, inexpensive, and tastes great. I love the exhibition kitchen where they make your food out in the open. It's rather noisy but I like that in-the-thick-of-things atmosphere!\n\nThe Asian menu items are mostly very good. I don't care for the orange chicken here, but it's my husband's favorite. I go for the spicy kung pao chicken, although a few times it has been too salty. I also really enjoy the lettuce wraps. They are listed on the appetizer menu, but they make a great meal of themselves. Pei Wei has gotten a bit too trendy for me since we first started eating here, but I guess they deserve the success!"
1,"Last Saturday night I was itching for some barbeque.  I have not made it over to Bootleggers which is only about one mile from my house.  The menu is extensive with ribs, turkey, brisket, etc.  I am always hesitant to try a new barbeque place in town since I moved here from North Carolina and have had a hard time finding reliable BBQ in town........but it is out there\n\nI had ordered the smoked turkey leg with fries and coleslaw.  It was surprising tasty.   The turkey was slow cooked to perfection and was actually juicy, not dry.  It was spectacular.  I was quite surprised that I was able to have only a turkey leg and sides and be satisfied for dinner, but I was...........\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is inviting: rustic, dark and a good place for conversation and privacy.\n\nThe staff in attentive and detailed.  A fine addition to the neighborhood!"
1,"I am kind of a pho expert. Being vietnamese and all. =D. lol. \n\nAnyway, for a restaurant, this place comes as close as it gets to resembling my mom's pho. And I've been to pho places all over vegas, nor cal and LA. After reading some of the other reviews, I've decided to give their bun bo hue a try. Which generally is not a soup that I like (I'm white-washed for a viet), but let me just say, that I would like bun bo hue a lot more if Viet Bistro made it for me each and every time. After taking many friends here on different occasions, I was able to try different things. Like their amazing roast pork spring rolls (looks like slices of spam but tastes amazing!), and their sandwiches, the famous banh mi's (so good!). \n\nI only wish they had a location in city center, so that I don't have to drive all the way out there =D."
0,Good location and friendly staff. But need add  more classes  for what they charge a month
0,"As a long~time customer of this place, un4tun8ly giving my lowest rating thus far. Even though most other Xs have been good overall, this last time has changed my feeling about them. Over the wk~end, I had a craving 4 some chinese so an order was placed 4 pick~up instead of the usual delivery 2 avoid a tip as I had no cash on me & I don't like adding tips on cards. I had an associ8 go pick it up & when I asked 4 my receipt, I knew the total charged wasn't right (nearly $10 OVER) so I called them. \n\n   I asked 4 the amount of each item that was ordered as it wasn't reflected on the receipt & the menu I was ordering from had outd8ed prices.  Even so, calcul8ing the correct pricing it was still way over & then was told they charge 12% tax... Uhm, WHAT?? But even w/ that OUTRAGEOUS amount, some1 got paid about $10 tip for a PICK~UP order!! (Either that or I'm missing $10 worth of food I didn't order). They were given a chance 2 correct it & didn't even offer ANY rectific8ion. \n\n   I strongly feel that it doesn't matter if they knew this order was from an old~timer patron or some1 new to them (since I had some1 else picking it up) ~ if this is how they conduct business, I'm afraid I have 2 take mine elsewhere! @ least then I can get what is paid 4 instead of being ripped... EXTREMELY Disappointed in a place I USED 2 Like & frankly I should have disputed the charges on my card but they're losing much more than that in the loss of my business & what I've brought them... ;-("

0,"The doctor we saw over the weekend prescribed the wrong medication for my very sick 7 year old!! Imagine my horror when I found out two days later when I took my child in to see our regular pediatrician on a Monday. One drug was way too strong for my child's weight. The other was an outdated drug doctors hardly ever prescribe anymore because there are newer, more effective drugs to treat the illness. And that prescribed drug is not even approved for children!!! Oh, and get this, the diagnosis/medications were given without a swab test to confirm the illness. I am so appalled and angry that my child was a victim of such terrible medical care.\n\nIt's too bad because I had a great experience with another doctor when I had come to get treated not too long ago. But it was a different doctor who seemed more familiar with current medical practices. \n\nBoth doctors I've experienced are retired and working part time at the clinic - that should tell you something about this clinic's hiring practices. If you have no where else to go but Urgent Care Extra, cross your fingers that you'll get a good retired doctor who has bothered to stay current with new medical/medicinal advancements!"
1,"Ok peeps, let's chat.  The lady and I moved to the gayborhood a few months ago and were looking for a new brekky hang out.  Enter Scramble.  Cute place, nice and bright with lots of seating inside and out.  The have large menus on the wall for you to read while standing in line.  They have much to choose from, and for the veg-folk, they have four different vegan options!! I swoon over their vegan French toast, with syrup, Smart Balance, and a side of fruit (but I always order it with the sweet potato hash cause that's better! It's sweet pots mixed with mushrooms and zucchini and rosemary).  They serve vegan items on specific vegan plates and cook with a separate grill, how rad is that?  I truly appreciate their consideration.  Once while I was in there, I had a chance to chat with the owner, and I asked if he was vegan.  He said that he wasn't but that his brother is, so he tries hard to be conscious of the non-animal eating people, and also said that if there was anything that I thought would be good to eat, to let him know and he'd check it out.  Coooool!!"
0,"Palace Station is the first of the Stations Casinos chain, and it shows.  It's smoky, dark, and the food is only passable. The upside is the rooms are relatively cheap and it's close to the strip."
1,"A great place for anything kitchen. The owner is friendly and helpful and the price are reasonable. \n\nThey carry everything from spice racks to pressure cookers to every mold shape you could ever desire. They also sell a selection of spices and Wilton cake making supplies on the side wall. \n\nI went in today looking for a spice rack solution for my kitchen: it had to not take up counter space and not be too heavy if wall-mounted. Sadly, I didn't find anything, but what I did find was a rubberwood counter hugging cutting board for $15. \n\nPerfect-o!"
0,"Got a group of friends together for a Saturday night and thought HBJ's would be a great place to cut loose.  The restaurant is set up with long tables all picnic style but it worked for us.  Our waitresses were AMAZING and deserve a 5 star rating, kept separate tabs for all of us, handled a group of 12 with ease.  The food was so so but the place is meant to be a country bar so I can understand food isn't their priority.\n\nMy low review is based on the owner.  After dinner, we all wanted to mingle a bit and asked if we could take the large high top table right behind us.  I asked if we could keep part of our dinner table just in case someone wanted to sit and our waitress said ok.  Five minutes later an old lady came over and asked if we were keeping our dining table.  I said we didn't need the entire table but wanted to keep some chairs in case we wanted to sit.  The old lady slapped me on the back and told me she was the owner and was going to \""kick me out\"" for asking to keep our table.  Then she abruptly walked away.  I was very confused but a few moments later she went up to another member of our group and threatened to kick them out too!  Turns out she wanted to seat a group of her regulars at our table (even though I had called ahead and made a reservation).\n\nIt was very clear she didn't want our business so we paid, tipped our server well and left.  Probably won't go back either."
0,"1 star for ice cream parlor.\n\nEverything else wasnt even mediocre. They ran out of clean plates and the clean plates werent even clean. I asked my boyfriend to grab me  clean plate to a slice of the driest German chocolate cake ever and there was still pieces of left over food on the plate. \n\nThe hour wait to eat on a Monday for lunch was a waste of time. It lacked variety and the serving area was completely, horrifying. \n\n3 words sums it up, EH, YUCK, AND YUCKY!"
1,"This is a nice sophisticated restaurant with an \""international\"" cuisine, meaning that it is good for business entertaining.  You can bring arbitrary guests here and be pretty sure they will find something appropriate (which is pretty typical for a good hotel restaurant).  There is always a vegetarian dish and a fish dish, both of which are typically very good.\n\nThe place has a very nice ambiance, excellent service, and provides a pretty quick turn-around at lunch time, or even dinner time.  There is also an express menu  at lunch time that has a nice variety of items, an interesting collection of tastes, and which comes quite fast, including a selection of small desserts."
1,"Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."
1,"We don't even know how to express our overwhelming gratitude for what Kym did for us, the pictures are beyond amazing! So many of them made us tear up because they so perfectly captured that day. We totally relived all of those dreamy moments because Kym was able to capture them with such amazing skill, passion, love for people and what it means to marry your best friend. We love her to death and couldn't have asked for a better photagrapher / friend, she truly is the best! We are so excited to to get them printed and hang them around our house as well as share them with our families.

She may start off as someone you hire but she will end up a part of your family. We love you Kym!"
0,"I've been to CR numerous times for drinks with friends on the weekend and thought it would be a fun place to take a friend from Chicago.  Three of us went for a late lunch today and were extremely disappointed.  The service was not too impressive, especially considering it was very slow; we had to keep asking for drink refills and it took a long time to track down our server so we could pay our bill.  Even more disappointing was the food...it was overpriced and nothing was even \""ok\"".  We ordered the queso dip appetizer, and we all agreed it tasted like Cheez Whiz and was very overpriced.  The caesar salad was soaked in dressing to the point it wasn't edible, and was served with a toast-like bread that was stale and tasteless. Two of us had carne asada dishes (a salad and the taco platter), and the meat was incredibly tough and bland...I ate 1/2 of a taco and couldn't choke down any more.  This was one friend's first experience with carne asada, and we had to assure her that this is NOTHING like true carne asada.  I would never go back to CR for the food...there are a lot better places to eat at Tempe Marketplace."

1,"After a few more visits, I think Kaizen deserves a bump up to 5 stars!\n\nConsistently good service, helpful and friendly sushi chefs, and most importantly, they served me amazingly delicious live Uni AND they have fresh wasabi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kaizen-fusion-roll-and-sushi-henderson-3?select=5wwkK5J3s0zJwPL_OAIOLg#TuJ6XKrUJZWgLcCvfayp1Q\n\nPlus, they always bring out my son's cute kid's meal out ASAP, which is awesome. All these things makes me want to come eat here even more!"
1,"So I started this weight lost journey last year, I lost 58 pounds and am still on the losing streak (this losing streak I can handle) now at the apt complex I live in, it had a gym that has been very useful for me, up till 2 weeks ago when they shut it down. Plus to be honest because it was so close to my place I didn't go regularly, I got lazy.  So that was my push to get a gym membership, I looked around and Gold's gym seem to me the best bang for your buck!  I am happy with my choice! Had my 1st work out their yesterday, it was just cardo, but I did get to check out the gym and look forward to making this my new gym! And with my membership I get a lesson with a personal trainer, got my appt all set up for Friday. Look forward to continuing my losing streak and working out!"
0,I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
1,"Update: they have changed the French dip special. It is now $5.99 for the sandwich and REGULAR fries (no more waffle fries, SOOO disappointing), no drink included now so you would have to pay for that separately :( It's not a big enough price difference to make me boycott their kickass French dip and fries but it's disappointing that there is no combo that includes a drink now.\n\nI have changed my mind on their \""Chinese\"" food as well. I'm not imagining it, in all truth I get a really bad headache when I eat it. I don't know what they use to make it but it's happened numerous times and the only variable is eating that food. So no more Chinese entrees for me. The French dip is delicious and I've never had a problem with it. They still have a decent variety of foods and awesome breakfast specials from midnight til 7 am. Their breakfast potatoes and bacon are really good, and for lunch I sometimes get a chili dog or a chili bowl. Mm!"
1,"Stacey is not only the best waxer I've ever had, she even taught me a few new things! This chick knows her sh*t! I just love her!! She uses the best products and I loved getting my candy looking body scrub..that she gives for FREE!! Highly recommended..will be going back for sure!!"
0,"I was thirsty and decided to get a drink.  McDonald's is the best place to get something cheap, especially when you're on the strip."
0,"Went here last night and this review will be solely based on the quality of food. The drinks and service were decent.\n\nEvery other Blue Ox I've been to have the best chicken fingers I've ever had, except this one. I ordered chicken fingers with a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was inedible and the chicken fingers were warmed over pieces of...well.\n\nThey were akin to what you'd find in an elementary school lunch or prison. Despite being hungry I had one bite of slaw and one finger that needed to be doused in ranch and I couldn't stomach finishing the rest.\n\nThe server must've known that the food is terrible because he didn't even flinch when he took the full plate away from me.\n\nIt's unfortunate that they don't have the same quality as every other location."
0,'cest plate a dire mais je suis contente que sa soi fermer il nous escroquais vraiment trop surtout avec le menu degustation.
1,"Ohhhh yes. After coming here for the Yelp event, I knew I would be back, but I wasn't sure that it would be consistently good (I would guess a restaurant would try to be top notch for an event). That being said, this was just as good as the first time on our second trip. We went on a beautiful Phoenix winter day (70's and partly cloudy...ahhh) and sat on their lovely patio. We got the chips (which they had run out of at the event) and they were pretty amazingly delicious. They are crispy, but not too crispy and the sauce pairs with them perfectly. Additionally, I got a side of their wonderful and amazing jalapeno sauce....so good on just about everything....especially the chips. YUM! We also each got a Paris Texas burger....very tasty stuff. I like that they make their prosciutto crispy....I have never had it that way, and it is wonderful. The food here is pretty substantial too, ate it for a late lunch and was too full to eat again all night. I would say that this place doesn't have my favorite burger in town, but it is in my top 3. I definitely will be back."
1,"One of my top three Vegas Buffets.  It's been awhile since I have been so I can give you a run down of what is there, but I do know I'm thinking of it :) :)  Worth a trip to Vegas.\n\nOther two on my list in Vegas: Spicemarket Buffet & Bellagio Grand Buffet"
0,"Worst marketing in the city. Standing on street corners downtown, verbally harassing pedestrians and littering their pornographic \""advertisements\"" all over town. I don't have a problem with nudity, I have a problem with the cards being accessible to small children- so inappropriate. \n\nThese promoters are annoying as hell, disrespectful, and know no boundaries. If I don't make eye contact, here's an idea: leave me alone. That is not a coy way of inviting you to follow me down the street ten yards and toss papers at my retreating back."
0,"I go here often because it's a convenient spot to meet up before the game, but after they treated my friends and I so rudely this past weekend I'll never bother again. We grabbed a beer at the bar in the back because it was less crowded and we were standing in a corner and in front of the stairs that were blocked off from public access anyway but we got yelled at (and I literally mean yelled at) to move because that area wasn't for standing room. (Like I said, I go often and we actually always stand on that side of the bar and it's always pretty crowded so I don't even think that's a rule.) So, we moved to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at us AGAIN! Apparently we were still in the way. We actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted us and said either get out of the way and go outside. He was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in like we were rowdy college kids causing a scene! It was really obnoxious. I don't think I can bring myself to give money when they treated us like they didn't even want us there."
1,"I came here for the 1st time this past Saturday & I only wish I had started coming here sooner! I usually go to the Harkins on Bell & 34th st, but I like this location MUCH more, this will now be my go to movie theater. It's much cleaner than most movie theaters I've been to & it's HUGE! The screen & sound also seem to be of much higher quality. The employees here are also friendly & helpful. Even though I don't have kids, I think it's pretty neat they have a place where you can drop your kids off at to play if you want to see a movie & couldn't find a sitter. Not sure if it's complimentary or not but either way it's a cool idea! \n\nP.S. The movie my mom & I saw was Just Go With It, horrible movie! Adam Sandler needs to stop making comedies already..."
0,Unclear what all the fuss is about. I certainly wouldn't stand in line for this place. There was nothing too interesting on the menu. I had pancakes. They were fair. Wouldn't get them again. The server at the counter was very pleasant and efficient.
1,Came here based on the great yelp reviews. They weren't lying. Kevin D did a great job on a mani pedi. Thanks!!
1,"Can I just say \""Thirsty Thursday\""? Raspberry Vodka Cake topped with a Vanilla Buttercream and drizzled with a Raspberry Coulis--OMG! My absolute fav is \""Kayla\""--vanilla cake/lime curd/lime cream cheese. She's seasonal, but I'll wait!!!"
1,"Stumbled across this board game bar as part of a trip to Montreal. Would definitely recommend it! Staff are very friendly - the board game master knows what he's talking about! Wide variety of games - munchkin, settlers, to less known ones. \nGood prices on beers, nibbles. \nBe aware that you do pay per game to play!"
1,"Best Chinese food on campus if not in champaign. The food has a home cooked feel to it and does not look like it came out of a can or a pre-cooked frozen package like most Chinese food.\n\nDishes to try: General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Gado Gado, Beef Ho-Fun"
1,"Hula's - Finally someone made something special and interesting out of my favorite \""Empty\"" building downtown.  I used to drive by for years looking at what I thought could really be an interesting property if anyone had any imagination at all. \nHula's has been open for awhile now and I should have written something much sooner.  Been in several times and each turned into a classic event.  Excellent drinks, food, service was quick and with a smile.  The best people watching - \""check out the action at night on the highrise balconies to the north next time your are in\"".  The place is a PLUS along with the art and music you can now find downtown.  Even watching the light rail quietly glide by at night adds a real \""metro\"" feel to Hula's and downtown. \nI always loved the large \""Jewel Facet like\"" window in the old 60s GEO dome structure over the main bar area and the expanded patio along main Central Ave is an excellent addition.  Thank you for making something truly interesting out of this place."
1,"Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  \n\nAs for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.\n\nI usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.\n\nThis place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!"
1,"I am completely in love with Noodlehead!!!  \n\nAfter reading reviews about this Thai street food restaurant in Shadyside, I got up early one Saturday, and took myself there for lunch.  I got there at 12:15, shortly after they opened.  It is a wonderfully relaxed, seat yourself, BYOB, CASH ONLY place.  \n\nAnd the food....ooooooh the foooooood....\n\nI got the pork belly steamed buns, which I could live on, honestly.  Absolutely amazing.  I tried the Sukothai, a soup on their \""snack\"" menu.  Wonderful stuff.  And although I should have stopped there, and I didn't realize those two items would be a perfect meal, I also ordered the Street Noodles #2, which was also completely yum.  I got enough food for 2 meals for $22!!!   \n\nI have been telling everyone I know to check this place out.  A place this wonderful just further proves to me that Pittsburgh is becoming a foodie town.\n\nA couple things to keep in mind:\n\n- it is cash only, but there are 3 atms in a 2 block radius.\n- Being Shadyside, it is on street metered parking, and I recommend leaving S. Highland Street for a side street and walking a block or two.  Don't forget your quarters."
0,"just, well, gross.  \n\nThe food was just downright awful.  I got a chicken burrito & the chicken was weird & disgusting & I got sick halfway through eating.  \n\nThere are plenty of Mexican & pseudo Mexican restaurants in Charlotte to go to, choose them instead."
1,"Upscale vegan Thai cuisine done well. I had a saute dish with mock chicken and veggies and rice, and my husband had a noodle dish with a few types of mock meat. Both were great, and we look forward to going back on our next trip to Montreal."
1,Not very experienced in Middle Eastern food but loved my chicken 'naanwich'.   Its a safe bet and the kabuki rice was awesome.  It appears most items are made from scratch so if you want to add a piece of naan to your meal expect about 10 minutes while they bake it fresh.  Everything was fresh and had a good flavor --- I'm craving it as I write this!  I went for an early dinner and 2 waitresses were very helpful.
1,"I love this place. Reason being...Apple experts everywhere. Was in the market for a new Macbook Air and Melia took great care of me, and even surprised me with the discount I get from work which I had forgotten about altogether. Ooops. I definitely recommend going to see her and also getting AppleCare/ That's a great service, even if you have to call Apple for servicing on products. I have an all Apple household and it's worth the $. Superior products and customer service. \n\nNow if my 3 week long wait for my iPhone 6 Plus was done like tomorrow I\""d be happy as a clam!!! 5 Stars for sure!"
0,"Tried out Lotus of Siam because it had good reviews on CH and Yelp plus it was on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown Vegas show that we just watched before coming here.\n\nMaybe reservations by phone a few weeks before coming here.  That was easy to do.  Ask them for the cross street, because if you have a dinner reservation it's hard to find the place!\n\nEveryone says to get the Northern Thai dishes at LOS.  So we tried a few things:\n\nKhao Soi $10.95 - egg noodle curry soup.  We thought it was just ok, nothing special.\nSome red onions, pickles, lime on the side.\n\nKang Hung Lay $10.95 - red pork curry.  It was a small dish of just pork and curry sauce w/ some cilantro on top.  Tasted just ok, nothing special.\n\nNorthern Tom Kah Soup $10.95 - a bit spicy and sour without coconut milk soup, chicken is dry, some grape tomatoes flavorless, some mushroom, meh.\n\nSticky rice $2 - for 1 person, meh, dry.\n\nThai ice tea $2.5 - very sweet!  Had to dilute it with lots of water & ice.\n\nHot tea $2 - some container of hot tea w/ tea bag, nothing special.\n\nGlad I tried it, but probably won't go back."
0,"Well, what can I say,, I had a poor expereince at McCorkicks in Sacremento and thought I would given them a go again in Las Vegas, I had the stuffed shrimp which were so small you could but them in ANY supermarket for a few dollars for 12, this dish was $25 and the portion was, wait for it not even 6 BUT 5 to a portion and small at that... I was not looking for a large portion but more so quality. this was a waste of money but even greater a waste of my time,, sad"
0,"Gross, gross, gross. Good if you like your brisket to taste like chemicals."
0,"I tried the vegan tiramisu, which is my favorite dessert.. I was actually quite disappointed. This dessert is supposed to be very delicate, light, airy, melt in your mouth. The one I bought from Red Velvet Cafe was very very sweet, very very sweet, it was like eating a spoon full of sugar. There was no moisture to this cake..sorry but I've had vegan tiramisu and this was not, this was not even regular tiramisu."
1,"I've probably been here around ten times, but haven't reviewed this spot!  Okay, here's my two cents:\n\nThe fact that it's been years and it's still popular does prove that it's still a happening spot.  When you have a good promoter and an even ratio, girls and guys get in for free, and girls have been getting free open bar for an hour (just go to the less popular bar areas to load up on drinks for the boys in your group, too!).\n\nThe bathrooms upstairs are interesting though annoying at times...the main dance floor is super tiny which is a mistake on their part...but the beach upstairs (which isn't always open) is beautiful and more spacious.\n\nBut the best part of all is that I did meet my boo here.  So despite the common notion that you can't find any quality men/women in the clubs...well, I guess we found love in a hopeless place (or am I just encouraging exceptions over rules?)."
0,"Once again, I have a problem with a distinct lack of customer service.\n\nI went to this location and picked out several items of clothing to purchase.  The reason I usually love this store is because I get weekly mailers with discount options to bring in.  Additionally, I had Kohl's Cash on me and a gift card due to a previous return.\n\nI got up to the cash register to pay for my items and the woman was so unpleasant, she couldn't even take the time to smile at me.  The way I figure it is if you hate your job that much...quit.  Especially when you work in a customer service fueled industry like retail.\n\nThe woman finished inputting all of my purchases and I handed her the Kohl's cash I had, which she immediately pointed out was expired.  One rule I've recently found out was that any Kohl's store will honor their Kohl's Cash for up to seven days after the expiration date, which I told her.  She rolled her eyes and called a manager to come over and help her out.\n\nThe manager showed up and fiddled with the keys for a bit before he exasperatedly looked up and me and said...\""look, we can't really honor these things if you don't give them to us until after everything's already been totaled.\""  You are kidding, right?  It's a simple as pasting on a fake smile and asking the customer, \""and, before I ring you up, do you have any savings today?\""  Especially in a store that deals so stringently in savings material.\n\nHe was even more agitated when I asked him to re-ring every item to include our savings.  We ended up with a total saved close to $150.00.  Why would I just eschew that?\n\nThanks for making my decision to go to another Kohl's so much easier."
1,"Friendly staff and good service. May have been the dudes first day- he wasn't very quick, but still got the job done."
0,"Better than most chain pizza, it's ok.  \n\nWe got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.\n\nI guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town.  It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere."
1,"Leaving the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts on a rainy afternoon, I was thinking about how I might satisfy my chocolate craving when lo and behold, a sign appeared at eye level saying \""40 flavours of hot chocolate\"" (well, it might have said it in French). Hmmm...sounded promising. \n\nMoving through this eclectic shop, I felt like Alice in Wonderland.\n\nThe front section gave me a flashback to university days when my German roommate would pick up specialty groceries at the European deli. So many interesting and delicious things from real French mayonnaise to Ricola teas to many many many kinds of chocolate. \n\nThe middle of the store had German and Swiss clocks of every scale imaginable. Cuckoo clocks, grandfather clocks, wall clocks, and even a case full of wearable clocks...oh yes, we call those watches.\n\nIn the back I found giant bears (of the stuffed animal variety) and tiny sports cars. My favourite item was a rocking horse but instead of a horse it was a plush elephant. Do you see why I was expecting to see mock turtles and the Red Queen at any moment?\n\nBut by far the best part of this store was picking my flavour of real hot chocolate. It's made like an espresso drink, with real chocolate crumbles measured out and steamed milk (or soy milk - yay!) stirred in. I had the mi-noir orange, and it was flavoured with real bits of orange. Oh. My. So good.\n\nThe only thing that was missing from all this wonderfulness was a place to sit and savour my drink. \n\nOne more thing before I sign off: they sell Swiss army knives made of chocolate. What more could a girl want?"
0,"As far as a chain office supply store goes, this place will do.  Sometimes it is a little confusing when you come in here looking for an item you would assume would be located in one aisle but is actually half way across the store.  Asking a staff member here where this item is located is about as useful as looking online.\n\nThe worst part about this location is that when you enter or exit the store you are hassled by panhandlers.  I assume they get better \""tips\"" over here because no one has the time at neighboring Trader Joe's."
0,"Honestly, their food is good but they never listen to me when I order. Well, not carefully I guess. The service is quick to refill drinks and check on us, but everytime I order any dish I ask if there's meat and they tell me what's in it. When I order a Japanese rice omelette with no pork, that's what I expect. Even when I order yakisoba noodles with no fish or seafood or whatever, I expect the same. Each time I went there to order these items, I always get a boat-load of fish flakes and pork. Maybe I shoud stop inconveniencing every restaurant by being a stupid vegetarian. Seriously though, I'm saving them money by using less ingredients. If there is a next time that I go there, I'm only sticking to drinks and onigiri."
1,"YUM YUM.  Was here on a LS deal twice!  Tried the curried goat, ox tails and the meat pies. ALL were incredible. I grew up eating Jamaican cuisine, so the food is very familiar to me. I am seeking a Caribbean place that serves Black Cake, which is a great experience to taste.  I make it myself, and it can be addictive."
1,"The Filmore Vig is a great spot for meeting groups and hanging out downtown. They do brunch with unlimited mimosas (that can be dangerous), and a bloody mary bar. The patio is big and there is always seating around the bar or on one of the big lawn tables. \n\nThe servers are friendly and quick to clean up the tables. The happy hour food (especially the hummus, wings and sliders) are a must try. They valet, which is nice because it is hard to find parking downtown.\n\nUptown still holds my heart, but this is a close second."
0,"This was my first time at massage envy.  I came here for an arm injury since I wasn't able to see my amazing chiropractor in California.  I went with specific instructions from my chiro on the type of massage and specific areas the masseuse to work on.\n\nI choose massage envy because its a chain so I figured it would be professional establishment.  Translation, not a sketchy massage parlor.  The introductory price was another bonus.  You could tell the masseuse was fairly inexperienced.  The massage was pretty generic.  I probably wouldn't return.\n\nBe prepared for the member spew when trying to pay for the ONE visit."
0,"Not even worth 1 star. Management is extremely rude and completely negligent to their customers. I even overheard a manager (found out her name was Rachel) speak to the staff in a complete unprofessional manner. Not to mention she was cussing at them and treating them as if they were her servants. Food is awful and always inconsistent. I know the guy Steve who used to ''own'' the chain and he is the biggest idiot, ignorant, and rudest person I've ever had the painful memory of meeting. Don't waste your time there, there are so many other BETTER places to go and get a cold beer and watch some sports!"
0,"After reading all these good reviews, I was pretty disappointed with my visit...\n\nWe ordered a couple \""box\"" meals that come with 5 fingers, fries, slaw, toast and a drink for $6.99. The food came out hot and everything tasted pretty good. Chicken was moist and tender. They have a great sauce which is similar to Raising Cane's but in my opinion it's a tad spicier, which I like. Fries were hot and crispy, toast was good, a little soggy but good and the slaw was, well it's fast food slaw. For the price you get a decent amount of food. The fingers are a little on the small side but that's nothing unusual.\n\nI'm giving Guthrie's two stars because the service was horrible and the restaurant was filthy. After ordering, we were never given drink cups. We get our food, still no drink cups. I go up to the counter and the girl behind it who was running both the counter and drive thru, completely ignores me. One of the cooks in the back asks what I need, tells her, I stand there for about 2 minutes and nothing. I decide to sit back down and wait, another 5 minutes go by, still no drink. I go up to the counter again, the same gentleman asks what I need, tells her yet again and they actually start a mini argument right in front of me about how busy she is and can't grab the drinks! The drive thru may have been busy but it was dead inside with only one other customer, who also did not get their drinks after they ordered. That's got to be fixed, it doesn't take but 30 seconds for her to grab a cup and ice.\n\nThe restaurant was also pretty dirty, all the tables were visibly greasy and had either salt or some sort of trash on them. With as slow as they seemed to be inside, I was surprised by this as other reviews mention their cleanliness. I'd eat Guthrie's again simply cause the food was decent and the price is great, but when I do go back, it will definitely be a drive thru visit only!"

1,"I recently played Rhodes Ranch, it is pretty close to the house and they have a great twilight deal. \n\nIt was $25 for Golf, range balls, cart, GPS, and 3 beers (free beer=happy me),  the course was pretty nice, a little challenging, but not too hard.\n\nThe $25 special is for NV residents only but it is worth checking out, if you have a local ID, but their normal rates aren't too bad as well."
1,"I just moved to Scottsdale and I was hesitant to try a new waxing salon... Urban Wax is great!  I've experienced many different types of salons, aestheticians and waxes, overall Urban Wax definitely ranks in my top 5. Alison is wonderful. The entire appointment took about 20 minutes. I won't say that it was painless, because waxing rarely is, but Alison was gentle enough that it hurt less than what i'm used to. You also get a free pair of lace panties after every bikini wax. The prices are great as well, less than what I typically pay. This is definitely going to become my go-to."
0,"I was totally surprised how rude the costumer service was this afternoon. \nA friend of mine stopped by to pick up his order of record sleeves that he had ordered a long time ago and when he received them they were not all there that he ordered plus they were all bent sleeves. So he ended up ordering 20 of the sleeves instead all 50 of them.  When the staff person was on the phone she didn't even explain the whole situation to her boss about the sleeves that he wanted . And on top of that she makes a rude comment on the phone to her boss in front of him and gives him a staring glare.  And the staff person cont. to say, \""oh! you probably don't want a bag to go with that.\""  My friend did need a bag for his record sleeves. \nI thought it was so immature and rude of this staff person who treated this friend of mine. \nAfter seeing that I completely changed my mind to buying anything there and not even support a local business the way my good friend was treated so rudely. We are not wasting our time and energy with a place like that again. Revolver records hire mature people not H.S. rude attitude staff."
1,"I know the title may sound strange but if you read this you will understand.  My family came to this Hotel on the last leg of our 3 city stay in Canada. The place itself is in a great location, if not for the constant construction across the street.  Each person we dealt with was nicer than the next.  One night we came back to the hotel after being out all day and gave the keys to the Valet to park our car.  They have underground safe valet parking, hay at $31 a night it better be safe.  Well the next morning I received a call from the front desk that I need to come down because my car was involved in an \""incident\"" last night.  I immediately thought the worst.  After meeting with a Hotel Manager, Maxine, she took me to see my car.  Apparently the Valet scraped the side of my van against a concrete pole.  Luckily first of all the car was driveable  and the manager assured me that the Hotel will not only pay for the damage to my vehicle but will also credit me my last nights stay as well as not charge me for parking.  I live over 400 miles away and in another country, I can only assume they will keep their word.  I was given papers about the incident and who to contact about it.  I came home and got an estimate for the repairs and a rental car.  I sent it to them and they said no problem.  i repaired my car and not long after received a check from the hotel to reimburse me in full.  I have to say that they were totally up front with me and did the right thing.  We had a pleasant stay and would come back in the future."
0,"I decided to try this place because they have a yelp coupon ($35 for $50) and it was open today on Easter.  When I walked in they told me that the coupon isn't valid on weekends (which wasn't specified on the coupon or website) but they decided to honor it regardless (+1 star). I was thankful that they honored the coupon but I was dissatisfied with the gel manicure. The man who did my gel pedicure was excellent (+1 star). My gel manicure was a disaster, first the lady had to re-do my right thumb 3 times because the gel Polish kept bubbling and sliding. Probably because she kept me seated at the pedicure station instead of moving me a to a table. And instead of fixing two other fingers on my left hand (they have a weird ridge going along the nail bed) she just left them (probably out of frustration). I didn't complain because at that point I have been there for a while and could tell she was just over fixing my manicure. My advice would be to skip this place for a gel manicure and get the guy to do your pedicure."
1,"In Phoenix for the weekend and met some friends here for a birthday celebration. I've heard about the original Vig and have been excited to know that one was coming to North Central. The reputation did not disappoint. The building is beautiful, the parking lot is full of expensive cars and the place is full of beautiful people eating, drinking and playing bocce ball. No ironic hipsters here drinking PBR, this is a place where you want to be in shape, dress up and head out for a fun night. They even have a \""Vig Rig\"" to give rides to from the bar to people who've had too much to drink. I was just there to socialize so I didn't get a chance to try the food, but friends said it was good. \n\nIts exciting to see a new place like this in the area and nice to know that good restaurants and bars can continue to succeed and thrive in Central Phoenix."
0,"Just awful customer service, really disappointing.\n\nI made a reservation here a month before our visit - we were 20 strong, a soccer team in town for a tournament.  I was the first to arrive, and the hostess said to let her know when we had 10 there, and she'd seat us.  When 10 arrived, I let her know.  They started to lead us to our seats, in the Main Hall as we'd requested.\n\nThen, confusion strikes.  She leads us to a table with people already sitting at it, one of our group says \""uh...we don't know them...\"" and she laughs, then realizes he wasn't joking, and says \""really?  no way!\""  They claimed that this other group came in and said they were us, so they gave them our table.\n\nHowever, I suspect the true story is that they screwed up and gave another party our table, under no fault of the people sitting at the other table.  My proof?  While we were waiting for our 10 to arrive, I heard them call \""Leslie, party of 6.\""  We were Leslie, party of 20.  So, the Leslie party of 6 was seated, then they realized they screwed up and tried to blame them for wrongly taking our seats.  Not cool.\n\nThe manager was involved in all of this, and he is the sole person to blame for the mistake, and the failure to fix the mistake.\n\nThey sent us back to the lobby and made us wait until a table for 20 was open.  By the time we were seated, it was 45 minutes past our reservation time.  We had just played 3 soccer games before going to dinner, and were all more than starving, and grumpy.  It truly sucked.\n\nHe tried telling us that we could just sit in the beer garden if we wanted - anyone who has been here knows that would be lame.  There is no entertainment, and it is not fun like the main hall is.  We came there to party, not have a conversation.\n\nWhat they should have done:  Admitted it was their mistake, not blame some other customers.  Given us free mini-beers while we waited, or at least offered us water or SOMETHING.  Apologized.\n\nThe manager here sucks, I won't be back.  Oh, and our server sucked and was rude to some of the people in our group, but we still had to pay the 18% tip they tacked on.  I hate that rule with a passion you would not believe."
0,"We have been on a Pittsburgh \""mission\"" so to speak to try and taste all the BBQ joints in the greater Pittsburgh area. Today we tried the Swhinery and report is:\nRibs were OK but very fatty....did not seem to be of a high quality?\nBrisket served was ice cold and had very little smoke or BBQ taste.\nPulled chicken really was best of the 3 but was not really \""pulled\"" but seemed to just be chucks of chicken not actually pulled. \nMac n Cheese was bacon mixed and again just OK\nPotato salad was very good\nChili nachos were good and a huge portion.\nOverall we have just experienced far better across the board at several of the other BBQ joints we have tried thus far. I believe the Swhinery was the 10th place we have tried and it is definitely in the bottom 5 IMO. \nPrice was pretty fair and service was very good. Wish the BBQ had been better!!"
1,"I like this place! It's quiet, the place is big and laid out well.. the slot selection is awesome to boot, and hell I visited the little Grand Cafe to grab lunch and the waitress was nice enough to offer me the $9.99 special for a steak with mashed potatoes and greens.. gotta say was the best steak I ever had at $10 seriously topping other places that charge double.. On top of it being a nice place I won $75 easily paying for my lunch and dinner later on that night! Station's are great casinos they don't try to be anyone else but themselves and treat you right."
1,"I use Yelp all the time and never felt compelled to write a review before, but had such a great experience at TBS--just have to share!  First of all, even though I'm probably much older than the average client, I was a brazilian-wax virgin ... and freaking nervous to even give it a try.  But, I'm a big girl now and decided this is the time to go for it.  After researching a bunch of places, I selected TBS and Stacey, especially because of the fabulous ratings on Yelp.  Considering the way she would reply to reviewers, I figured she was a classy lady, which is important to me as I'm baring everything intimate to a virtual stranger ... I'm even tentative with my OB-Gyn.  Sure enough, Stacey's a very cool and classy lady and her waxing spa mirrored her class act--it's extremely clean, set up for the customer's privacy and comfort, with a contemporary upbeat and positive vibe.\n\nStacey made me feel comfortable from the start--we chatted like friends who were catching up, despite the exposed position you're in while chatting LOL.  I was in and out of there quickly, yet never felt rushed and her work was so precise.  I took a couple of extra-strength tylenol before going in, nothing else -- and honestly all I felt was a couple of momentary stings.  I had experienced more hurt and inflammation with the old strip style bikini wax, but this hard-wax full brazilian was relatively painless and carefree for me!  Plus, I love that Prince Reigns serum--I had NO redness, no bumps--amazing!  (Yes, Stacey, I know, I don't need to use a lot, just a tiny pump.  See?  I was paying attention to your after-wax instructions.)  Also, just a note: they don't push any products on you, but they sure have some good stuff, nice specials, a 5-day free touch-up (if you need it, I didn't) and extremely reasonable pricing.\n\nMahalo, TBS and Stacey, for being the absolute best!"
1,Came here a few weeks ago and was disappointed to see that they got rid of the bar.\n\nWell...last night I came to watch the movie Argo and was pleased that the bar was back AND the theatre was strictly for 21+. Obviously so they can cater to everyone in the theatre and didn't have to worry about underage drinking.\n\nSurely made the experience that much better. Must've refilled twice during the movie =)
0,I WAS SO SAD TO FIND OUT I WASNT GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST BURGER EVER!  after driving by and hearing all the rave about this place (and since kilroys kitchen was closed) i decided today was the day! Customer service good! The food is a different story.....i ordered their spicy burger and their bbq and rosemary fries and the results????? My burgers were cold and tasted re heated not much flavor and all the topping on one side of the burger.....I asked for extra jalepenos and un less they usually put two on the sandwich the four that were on there were far from extra for me.....the fries were really good but for $20 bucks for two burgers and an order of fries equal to the same amount in mc donalds medium fries i would have to say to eat here again they would have to bundle everything and throw in a drink for 2.99 and i might MIGHT think about eating here in a pinch. Not to mention the place was empty and i wasnt a victim of rush hour!
0,"We were big fans of the restaurant that held this location before Briggs.  So we were really looking forward to the opening of this new place.  We hoped that they would become our new favorite.  Large was our disappointment.\n\nThe food was bland...really, really bland.  The atmosphere was that of a 1970s family diner.\n\nWe politely paid our bill, left the rest of our food (we only ate a few bites) and left in search of something we could actually eat."
1,"this buffet definitely has a lot of variety.  i thought it would never end haha.  best part is unlimited drinks!  wine/beer included.\n\nit's about 30 minutes from the strip, and $36 plus change for the meal.  guess they just started this last saturday, but...\n\nTIP: if you go on SATURDAY get a player's card (free) and get a buy one get one free meal!"
1,"Stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in.  Since then we haven't stopped eating at Athenian Express.   A good five miles out of the way.    What attracted us?  Great food, great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly.  Seriously one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met.   I started out with the Turkey Pita.  Delicious. Yet she urged me to be more creative.   Love it all now including the staff.   There isn't a day where it isn't hussle and bussle in the place,  yet the service is fast and always accurate.  Seriously, I eat it almost every day."
0,"I keep waffling between 2 and 3 stars--2.5 is appropriate. Banfield is to pets what Nextcare is to people. They're available when you can't get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow quick turnaround on service at a decent price. \n\nThe issue I'm having is their immediate upsell on tests and \""extra's\"" and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication. In today's economy, I can't believe that Banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits. People don't have a lot on extra money to throw around--that's why they're coming to Banfield in the first place, right? \n\nOur last visit my dog Fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so I asked for a price quote. The first step was to upsell me on tests (allergy tests, skin tests, etc) and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just Rabies and Bordatella. There was a shot for parvo (seriously? thought that was just once when they were puppies) and one other disease I didn't remember. \n\nAfter the vet examined Fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him, everything from an anitbiotic, an analgesic, an eye wash, an eye ointment and an allergy pill. Total bill was to be $465. I scrapped the vaccinations (can get them done at the Phx Spay/Neuter Clinic for much cheaper--$40) and all the extra tests--and when I was looking over the needed meds I noticed that the eye ointment was listed at $84.99! For a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment. Essentially we're looking at spending $85 on a tube of neosporin. I was shocked! The tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if I felt it was too expensive. I immediately agreed.  I took the rest of the meds and with the appointment the total came to $105. \n\nHere's the kicker--I called 1800PetMeds--the price for the ointment: $35.99 plus shipping--oh it gets better! I called CVS on 7th Street--$24.99 but they'd have to order it. It gets even better than this---So I dropped it off at CVS on 16th and Camelback and went to pick it up in the afternoon--price was $15.99! A whole $70 cheaper than Banfield! Can you believe that markup??? \n\nStaff was friendly--everything else was alright--just watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill. Ask the question--are these necessary and does my pet really have to have that? Oh---your regular pharmacy can fill almost all pet medications. Check with them first--you'll keep some of that hard earned money in your pocket!"
0,Gross. This place is a disgrace to mexican food . I swear everything in our plate came out of a can. Not fresh and not by anyway good. I hate leaving a place hungry but you couldn't force half that stuff town my throat.
0,This place is ok but not great for the price. I like the Mongolian but would like to pick out my own sauce though. The sushi is ok. I haven't had a roll there that has a good flavor. I like the different dishes on the buffet. I wish I could have tried some crab legs but its like Black Friday there. People are standing around and then they take them all. It is so rude. Then it takes forever to get another order out. They should bring orders to the tables so people don't go crazy and take them all. \nWhat really got me though was the dessert table. It was all Costco dessert. They didn't even take the cakes off the cheap plastic trays to make them look homemade. It just looked like a potluck where the families swung by the grocery store and picked out a cheap cake. For 15 dollars at least try to fool me. \nI won't be back.
1,"Highly recommended for Latin American food, but make reservations.  We went for dinner on 4th of July.   The dining area was pretty dark, but I later realized it was because we were outside and our eyes needed time to adjust.  I loved the black chandeliers everywhere.  Very lively atmosphere.\n\nI started off with the Watermelon Basil mojito.  Very refreshing!  The table next to us had ordered the tableside guacamole so although we had chips, salsa and guacamole for a snack earlier in the day, we had to get some.   We ordered medium spice and it had a good kick to it.  They do make it in front of you and for 2 people, it was a whole lot of guacamole!  \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the Duck Confit Empanadas, which ended up sounding better than it tasted.  It was not the pie crust dough like most empanadas.  Instead, it was like crispy wontons.  The crust was overcooked and it came with a sweet sauce so I felt like I was eating Chinese food instead of Latin American.  That was a disappointment!\n\nBy then, we were pretty full so although we ordered two types of tacos, we ended up canceling one.  We just had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were Tecata battered with a nice sauce.  It came with 3 street size tacos.  It was delicious.  The table next to us ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos which serves for 2.  That looked good as well as it came with a whole chunk of braised pork.  If we were hungry, we would have ordered that.  \n\nOverall, service was great.  Enjoyed most of the food and drinks.  If it wasn't for the duck empanadas, I would have given them 5 stars."
0,"Hits and miss. We came here with a party of 12 after we couldn't secure a desirable time for Bacchanal. First, easy to get reservation at anytime so that's a plus but indicative of what's to come. Ambiance is great. 20+ foot ceilings wonderfully decorated for Christmas. Now the food. It was really pricey even with the large portion. Most of the dishes were over salted and the complimentary bread was COLD. It wasn't even room temperature. Asked if they could heat it up a bit and said they couldn't. You have a whole freakin kitchen back there and you can't toast bread just slightly??\n\nStick with Bucca. There are several around the area on and off strip."
1,Always a lot of fun!  Beer and sausage!  Friendly staff.  Usually there's a band or a guy playing music.  Today I had sausage and mashed potatoes and won a beer chugging contest!  Won a free stein and a nice buzz!
0,"Food is good, but I will never again spend a dime in that place. I called to make an order for delivery when I was informed by the girl on the phone that they have a $25 minimum and a $7 delivery fee!!!!!! Are they kidding? That is insane, the food is good, but not that good. Curious if anyone in charge knows anything about business, delivery can be a huge money maker. Most other places have a $10 min and a $2 - $3 delivery charge."
1,"Nice people, amazing product, couldn't ask for anything better. Quinoa and kale salad is so delicious. I hope they make it out to Vegas. I would totally be a daily customer! In love"
1,"I just got home from Sweets N Beats and I already want to go back for more candy and vinyl. \n\nThis place is a small shop specializing in music and old school candy. They are nestled between The Trunk Space and The Bikini Lounge.\nI found lots of great records ranging from Talking Heads, various ska bands and a Rudy Ray Moore album. Good selection of yummy candy like squirrel nut zippers (a chewy, nutty candy), lemon heads, cherry heads, bubble gum cigrars and cigarettes. \nThey also have a selection of books, t-shirts and novelty items. \n\nDefinitley check Sweets N Beats out. It's a great addition to the downtown area and it's owned by two wonderful people.\n\nCash only here folks, so bring the green. Everything is pretty cheap, so you can walk out with a bag of candy under $3."
0,"We decided to give it another try last night since my aunt had some 2-for-1 coupons. It was their Friday night seafood buffet. \n\nI skipped the oysters this time. The clam chowder barely had any clams. The shrimp cocktail were not fresh once again. The ceviche was ok. The beef tenderloin was really tough. The ginger crab in the asian section was ok. \n\nWe were here mainly for the ginger crab legs. I want to apologize to those who had to wait behind me as I was stacking ginger crab legs on my plate. I was getting about 12 deep on each plate, and I got at least 4 plates of ginger crab.\n\nOur waitress was nice. Last time there was a waitress going around just to empty the crab shells off the tables, not last night though. Our table was always full of plates of empty crab legs."
1,"Came across this shop while at the deli next door for lunch. I had been looking to buy my first bike in a long time and been to some of the bike shops around town only to receive luke warm responses. \n\nNot PHX Bike. I walked in and saw a cool, small, local shop and knew I was in the right place. The owner Palmer was enthusiastic and pumped that I wanted to get a bike. He took his time explaining things that I should look for and didn't treat me like some like an outsider. So, I did some research on his recommendations and a few weeks later went back ready to buy the bike he reccomended. I was stoked, but I think Palmer was even more stoked. As I was walking out he said, \""You're going to have a new bike in a couple days!\""\n\nThis guy is knowledgeable, genuine and I look forward to being a long time customer."
0,"Despite being in a top-notch Vegas hotel, I Love Burgers just doesnt offer a decent meal selection for its patrons. The burgers are plain and overpriced. The reviews below exclaim at how huge the burgers are, and I seriously question their depth perception. Sure they're big...if you stare at them 3 centimeters away. I've had larger-sized burgers at my local diner for a fraction of the price.\n\nDon't bother getting their signature bacon burger either. For 17 bucks you get a patty with bacon bits along with strips of bacon on top. The problem is that you cant even distinguish the bacon taste in the bacon, and the bacon on top masks over everything anyway! They should call it the \""gimmick burger\"" instead. Fries aren't even included in the order! \n\n+1 star for having Killian's Irish Red on tap. It's the only thing I enjoyed on their menu."
1,"The barbeque was amazing, the ribs were meaty and tender, falling off the bone with a delicious sauce, and the quarter chicken was tender and tasty.  The atmosphere was so inviting on the patio with the live band playing that night and the pool area down below- it was a great night out with my boys - we were all stuffed and wanting to come back to try more."
0,"480termites to conduct termites inspection on a transaction I had in escrow,  they came back saying  property also had bed bugs, we hired them to treat for bed bugs, they treated a  total of 6 times, after nearly spending $1000, we decided to hire Burns to do heat treatment for the bed bugs, which 480termites don't offer, probably due to lack of experience, we were told immediately by Burns that we didn't have bed bugs and the dead bugs were just dog dog fleas! After spending all the money on the wrong treatment and loosing 2 buyers, I called 480termites to let them know I get the manger who didn't care and didn't wanna hear it and hands the phone back to receptionist!"
0,"I get it. She wasn't going to sing much (she didn't sing at all), but I would have at least appreciated some effort from Britney, you know, since she had all the energy saved by not singing. The dancers worked harder than she did (they also looked more interested in being there than she did). Disappointed to spend any amount of money to see someone flail their arms for 90 minutes and get carried around by their dancers. Hey Britney, take your own advice, you better work, bitch."
1,"From the first course to the last, possibly the best meal I've ever eaten - and I've eaten at places that are more than twice the price. They expertly executed every taste sensation from savory to smoky to sweet. If you're ever in Montreal, this is a must try!"
0,"I succumbed to peer pressure!\n\nDon't you hate it when you don't trust your own instincts?  OK, so Yelp is a great resource and so are friends' recommendations.  But when it comes right down to it, it's all a matter of opinion.  When it comes to Carolina's Mexican Food, mine differs from most.\n\nI've mentioned in other reviews that I love the idea of a mom-n-pop place where local owners are doing their own thing, contributing to the local economy with jobs and paying their taxes.  Plus, this place makes their own tortilla shells. so that's a nice touch.\n\nThe food isn't especially memorable.  The machaca or chicken tacos are appropriately sized overall, but contain mostly just iceburg.  See for yourself with the posted pics.  The chicken was flavorless, but the machaca was a bit easier to discern.  Also, the size of the cheese quesadilla was fine, though proportionately had little cheese.\n\nIn the interest of safety, I would NOT recommend coming here at night alone.  If you must, be sure you're with a group of people and at least one or two of you have sobered after a night of drinking.  This place is OK for taking care of the munchies.  Just be sure you're careful to be safe in this less-than-stellar neighborhood."
1,"You gotta feel it, It's electric!\n\nI hope you're prepared to boogie woogie for almost an entire year, cause that's about how long you'll be waiting for a chance to slide into your own all electric Tesla. \n\nYou gotta know it, it's electric. With up to a 300 mile all electric battery range, the Model S (and all Tesla's) are custom built to customer specifications; they begin delivering this years models in fall of 2012, but you've got to already be on the list to get yours. These baby's start at $57,000 (for model S) with a 160 mile range and can sport up to a 300 miles with an upgrade to the batteries ($77,000). You're in luck though, cause right now you can get a sleek $7,500 tax credit from the US Federal Government for buying electric!\n\nBut you know it's there, plug in everywhere. Model S comes standard with everything needed to plug in to any 240 or 120 volt outlet or public charging station. Charge yourself about 100 miles worth in 3 hours in a standard 110, or 100 miles in 1.5 hours from a 240 volt charging station. If you're worried about un-necessary charging and wasted electricity, the charge shuts off after the battery has reached capacity; I asked the Tesla rep!\n\nI've got to move, come let me take you on a party ride. Racing from 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds with 0 emissions, Al Gore might just throw you a party for helping to save the planet. This beauty is sleekly styled with aerodynamic feel, and toutes a low center of gravity with their innovative floor mounted battery design achieving optimal weight distribution. Be the envy of all your friends (eventually) with a 17'' driver control touch screen, and connect up all your Bluetooth or USB devices.\n\nSome say it's mystic, it's electric. Nothing mystic about it, this is American engineering and ingenuity at its finest! Man I wish I had one. Although, I'd have a tough time re-charging without an outlet nearby my parking spot. Maybe I could talk to the neighborhood HOA about that one.\n\nStop in to their storefront located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square on the second floor. Yelpers, it's time you learned the electric slide, but in Tesla style!"
0,"PAST ITS PRIME, NO LONGER JEWEL IT ONCE WAS\n\nBellagio is now just a middle of the pack Las Vegas hotel. Check in/out is most always crowded and often disorganized.  The worst is Fridays when the lines can be six people deep all the way across the hotel check-in area.\n\nAlthough the hotel recently renovated its rooms, they still fail to dazzle. During my stay, the bathroom sink constantly made a drain noise although the faucet was not turned on. This can be disturbing if you're a light sleeper. Also, surprisingly for a hotel with such a high room rate, the shower knob simply fell off as I lightly turned the water temperature up. In addition, cable TV kept going black or picture scrambled despite maintenance trying to fix two days in a row. You expect better from the Bellagio name - disappointed.\n\nAlso, the hotel's buffet restaurant has a wait most nights of 35 minutes to an hour (this according to the person who answered the restaurant's phone when I called after seeing the line reaching out into the casino floor). Obviously, the hotel should spend some of its money and expand the buffet restaurant to shorten wait times for hungry guests. \n\nThe casino looks like all the other middle of the pack dark looking casinos. The Bellagio can no longer be mentioned in the same class as Encore, Palazzo, or Venetian. These casinos are well lit, accommodations are first-class, and food options are plenty. Bellagio, sad to say, is an old jewel. Watch the fountain show and the pretty exterior on the outside, but beware of spending top dollar for a jewel past its prime."
0,"The only thing this Von's has going for it is that it was on my way back from grubbin' at In-N-Out across the street.  I've never had to pass through a turn-style to get into a grocery store - what exactly is that about? I understand the neighborhood is a bit on the sketchy side, but I've also never seen an entire aisle locked with gates - you need to have an employee unlock the gate if you need anything in the personal care aisle.  Maybe this shouldn't be held against the store in general, but it gives me a weird vibe.  \n\nWhile I was checking out, the cashier initiated a conversation about the economy and recession, making comments that not everybody can afford groceries anymore and how her personal financial troubles caused her home to lose value, etc.  She seemed very angry.  While I can definitely sympathize, it made me totally uncomfortable."
1,Customer service is great. However I come here all of the time. They need someone outside taking orders. Here now and people are pulling out of the line going next door to del taco.
0,I am relatively new to Las Vegas. A friend of mine suggested Ritual. I signed up to receive a $20 off coupon as a new client. Conveniently their hair cuts are priced at $60 and the coupon is only on services $65+. I called and asked if they could honor the coupon and their suggestion was to add a $35 deep conditioner. Really? You can't charge me $5 more for a haircut so I can take advantage of the coupon? Clearly you do not want new business. I will not be using Ritual.
1,A beautiful place to catch a Dodgers game! It's pretty hot during spring training day games so be sure to dress accordingly! You can come before during practice and watch the team practice... If you are patient you can try to get a signature!
1,"The cheese counter and \""Dear Heart\"" really are treasures.  They have all manner of fancy aged gruyeres, tons of olives, and even some sort of disgusting concoction called \""pepperoni cheese\"".  In any case, the place is all kinds of old-world beautiful.  Shelf after shelf of yummy goods, Italian imports...yum."
1,Tried them for the first time yesterday. Their place was nice and clean. The ambiance was pretty quiet and relaxing.  The staff was nice and professional. Took my 6 year old with me and she was made to feel very special. Great prices too! We'll be back.
1,"Loved this place. We were a large group coming in close to closing time, and he sat us down with no problem. We tried almost every appetizer. All good. All fried, but good. I had the 3 meat samplet and really wish I just got the brisket. I thought that the best. Large portions though. Will definately come back here. (Was here back in December)"
1,This place is the Oyster Bar inside Sunset Station. Alot of parking outside and inside garage.\nService was fast and got great service from Julian at the bar. Anthony is them man. \nSit at the bar just say how you want it and magic happens. Food was great on this visit and portions were right on. \nPlus cocktails right there no wait.\nReasonable prices and great portions of food with great quality and taste.\nHave fun and enjoy.
0,"This is only a review for their place on the square.\n\nI don't get it. Really, I don't.\n\nI've had the spicy cheese bread multiple times. Friends swear by it. My brother seemed to enjoy it.\n\nBut seriously, I don't get it. It's not very good--it's a bunch of mild, flavorless, overly-greasy \""cheese\"" (well, not that much these days) baked into a loaf of bread that I can only compare to a super crappy version of potato bread. The \""spicy\"" they claim exists is more like a handful of red pepper flakes baked into and on top of the loaf. It's not spicy. It's kind of cheesy. The redeeming feature is the burnt stuff on the bottom--the only part of the bread, imo, that's great.\n\nEverything else? No thanks. Are people's palates so bland that they think anything with a tiny hint of seasoning is \""great\""? Ugh. Oh, and the price--$8? Are you fucking kidding me? I can go two stalls down and get a 4lb loaf of absolutely incredible rye bread for $7. Why would I spend an extra dollar on an inferior product?\n\nJust...so much no."
0,"I've heard amazing reviews about this place so I tried it out for a gel manicure. The place is very trendy and I absolutely love how it is decorated. I was brought to a shelve with a ton of gel it's to choose from.. So that was cool. The lady who did my nails was friendly enough. The gel manicure itself wasn't done well at all. You could see through my nails and on the sides which I didn't realize until I got home. It was a little pricey as well. I'm sure ill be back, especially to try their pedicure. But I can find better service and product for cheaper when it comes to a gel maniure"

After you take your picture go get another number from the CDL window( its the cash register on the counter). 3 Bring all appropriate documents ( i.e. Birth certificate, social security card, current license, and or passport) 4. Hope for the best and bring a book."
0,"Terrible onion rings, super-thin soggy pizza. Too bad! It seems like a cute, family-run place that I would love to support, but I can't. \nIt also has odd hours, so call first. Closes at 2pm, reopens for dinner. Closed on Mondays. However, they often leave the street advertising banners/cards up during the times and days they're closed."
1,"I have been getting Rony's scissor cut for the past seven years. I have difficult, thick, kinky/curly hair and he knows how to make sure it looks good- immediately after the cut, and when it fills in too. In addition to a great cut, it is a pleasant break to talk and joke with Rony while in his chair. Finally, he has his own place! His prices are more competitive than in his past shops and and he still gives the best scissor cut in the valley. Shoulder massage and hot/cold towel, and rinse too, if you want."
0,"Worth the try, but not worth the cut.\n\nSince last being in Vegas many moons ago, I reminisced about the Stage Deli in The Forums. Where their deli sandwiches were the best we've ever had and the cheesecake flown in fresh from NYC were the ultimate. \nRecently we came across Carnegie Deli, located in the Mirage and it looked impressive with their own cured meats. Sandwiches were thicker than I could stretch my mouth and it made my eyes physically look bigger than my stomach. \n\nTonight we tried the corned beef sandwich which like many reviews it was very good, with perfect flavorings and very tender. We also tried the hot pastrami, it lacked flavor and was very disappointing considering the proportion of the sandwich.  I had to add a LOT of pepper to make it taste decent. Lastly, we had to try the \""famous\"" burger, which they advertise that they grind the burger meat themselves. Thumbs up for making a juicy burger, but again that lacked flavor.  It's almost like going to a steakhouse and ordering a succulent, juicy porterhouse and they don't season it."

1,One of the best habachi and sushi restaurant in vegas!! EXCELLENT food and GREAT customer service.

0,"This is my first time at LaPaz. I never went to the old location and if it's anything like the new one I'm not impressed. We had a party of 8 and our server Samara was decent. The food wasn't great. The rice and refried beans were bland. The queso and salsa weren't  bad, but the guacamole wasn't the best, too much lime and not enough salt.  My homemade version is better. Probably won't be back anytime soon."

0,"I am a Las Vegas local. We eat out frequently. This place has the worst wait staff in town. Rude bartender. Rude waiter. With an automatic 20% gratuity, why would he give a shit. Steaks were ok. Worst creamed spinach ever. Just can't get past the rude waiter. Being a local business owner, I wonder how these people can survive in our competitive market. Don't waste your time."
0,"I have shopped at ULTA many times and usually have a decent experience. Not since moving to Henderson though. I use the ULTA rewards and back in California the points accumulate and you may use them towards anything in the store that your little heart desires. That is not the case here, you can only get certain items that you could purchase at target or walmart for cheaper than ULTA offers anyways. Also, the coupons that are frequently in my mailbox offering great savings do NOT work on any of the nice cosmetics I go there to buy, in fact you can't use the coupon on any thing \""high end\"" because they limit the \""Prestige cosmetics and skincare.\""  Its funny because the coupon says prestige then lists some brands but they mean all brands except what you can find at target and walmart as well as ULTA brand you are also not allowed to use the coupon on fragrances. The ULTAs in CA let you use the coupon on most makeup brands and fragrance among many other items in the store that the Henderson stores do not. I'm not really sure why there is such a difference, but my trips to ULTA are limited to what is actually on sale in the ad because the coupons are a joke and the staff is less than pleasant."
0,"Wow.  I was the only one in line, and there were 5 people (all co-workers) sitting there chatting.  After I was ready to go at the register, it took another 3-4 minutes of waiting for them to finish chatting before I could get service.\n\nThere are way too many people that work here for the service.   At least the food was okay, although I have to say that it's not exactly \""fast food\"".  You might get better service at the Chilis Too in the same airport."
1,"I love Thomas Keller. Love him. And was excited to have breakfast hear, but did not leave with that Keller high I usually experience when eating at his restaurants. I think this place has been \""Vegasised.\"" Keller's brilliance is his ability to provide an experience of understated perfection - Vegas does not lend to that atmosphere."
1,"On a super hot day, my husband and I were looking for a nice place to stop in a have a cold drink.  After my husband saw the live duo play (a stand-up bass player and a keyboardist), he wanted in.  This is really a nice place to sit and absorb all the loveliness of the garden around you, and the music, too.  \n\nWe were seated and the waiter didn't seem to have a problem with us ordering drinks and Jardin Nelson had a long list of drinks, which we happy to see.  My husband had a beer and I had a $10 mojito which really hit the spot.  Kind of expensive, but this is a very touristy area in Old Montreal.  \n\nIf I'm ever back, I'd like to come back for crepes or some other French food.  This would be a nice place to be at any time of the day."
1,"Welcome to your classic Scottsdale dive bar. Upon entry, bar to the right, tables to your left. Towards the back you'll find arcade games, darts, TVs and a pool table too. The biggest selling point is the patio in the back that features several places to sit and opens up into the huge alley which doubles as a parking lot; triples as a restroom for some patrons. \n\nDrinks are cheap and the bartenders are always in good spirits. You'll meet some interesting folk here on any given night, so don't be afraid to crack open some conversation along with your beer. I can't think of a dive bar that I've frequented more in Scottsdale than Roadrunner."
0,"very dissapointed in this resturant.  the first time I went there I ordered a blue moon,  when I inquired about the orange slice, they brought me aglass of orange juice.  \n Ive gone back several times because friends that live in the neighborhood like to patronize this establishment.\n\nI attended the wilmore street festival a couple weeks ago, and all the resturants sold food, in booths. guess who ran out burger and company and the event was in their parking lot.  imagine that, others like open kitchen and pinkys set up temp kitchens in tents and the food flowed. its like they dont make the extra effort needed intodays business climate.  \n\nLast night I was invited to a birthday party there,  the party had been arranged with several meeting in person with the owner,  when the party planner showed up to start preperations she was met by the new manager and said we know nothing of your party or the fact there was a dj,  she did however know about the large food order that had been placed.  The party started and it was a very mild crowd of mainly older people who danced some, and just wanted to be with family and friends.  the bar service was teribbly slow, and finally the manager on duty very rudly shut the party down.  no effort was made on her behalf to make the event a sucess, it was already a very lucrative event for burger and company otherwise they would have been empty yet again on a sat night.  As I walked out the door,  and closed out my bar tab, that was the last one I will ever have in that establishemnt.  I will take my money elsewhere,  I felt like is was 1950 again in the way my african american friend were treated.  I was embarrassed to be white.\n\nYou need to look at the new mgr you just hired as she has cost you a ton of business in her first week. as I know of atleast 30 of your regular customers will not enter your doors again.."

1,"Here we go with another superfluous review of Hash House a Go Go.  We all know it, it looks like most of us love it.\n\nI seriously thought I was going to die during my wait for a table at Hash House.  My weekend in Vegas was coming to a close, and none too soon.  I killed more brain cells than I want to consider, and I was so ill from overconsumption that I could hardly sit up without battling the urge to hurl.  It was gnarly, at best.  I am so glad I waited, because Hash House magically cured me.\n\nTake my advice - if you had some errors in judgment during your Saturday night in Vegas, spend your Sunday morning by trekking to the Imperial Palace, wading through the smoke and celebrity impersonators, and taking the escalator to Hash House a Go Go.  Order a coke, and pick a skillet.  I suggest the chorizo.  Devour it.  Then go blow $50 in the penny slots and consume a hair of the dog that bit you.  All will be right in the universe again, trust me."
0,"Everyone runs into a poor experience now and then, and I guess we just didn't click as store and customer.  Ok, enough of the pen jokes.\n\nNot appearing too concerned that the defective Visconti Traveling Ink Pot had leaked all over me and I did indeed walk around with blue fingers for days, the thing that irked me into a two star review is that the owner waited a week to contact Visconti to get a replacement that apparently never came.  \n\nWhen you charge someone MSRP for one of these items, you tend to expect service if the unit is defective.  I must be on another planet to expect this, so I wound up contacting the Visconti distributor directly and have wound up spending an extra $20 for shipping outbound and return to Planet Phoenix.\n\nHey, my Kon-Peki blue fingers don't look too bad, anyway; it might even be good to scare the TSA folks as I check in tomorrow ;)"
0,"My boyfrind and I went to the Rio in search of a good dinner. We landed at Cafe Mortorano. We did the special where you get an appitizer, 2 entrees and a dessert for $44 each. We sat down and the waitress took a good 5 minutes to greet us. My boyfriend ordered his drink and I took water until I made my choice. It took her another 10 to 15 minutes to get the drink and to take our order. The food was semi up to par, however our server was horrid. She dropped off our entree's 30 minutes after our appitizer was cleared. She passed by our table several times without even glancing our way. Another server noticed and he was awesome at checking to see if our dinner was up to par.  No matter the food, the service was terrible."
1,"So I convinced the Lincoln Family YMCA to wave the $99 since it is part of their mission statement and all that they want to \""provide fitness regardless of your ability to pay.\""  \n\nI have been going on a regular basis and have been to a couple of the classes.  The instructors are knowledgeable and kind at every class I have been to.  \n\nI do think the Sunday hours need to be extended.  10am - 1:30pm is just not enough.\n\nThey keep the facility a little warmer then I would prefer, but it is a big old building so it might be as cool as they can get it, but I often wish they would kick the cooler down a couple notches.  \n\nThey do a good job keeping the machines in good condition.  I have been to other gyms where equipment would have out of order signs for months."

0,"Interestingly, we had great anticipation for a great dinner.  Sadly, we had a server who was so aggressive that it really undermined the experience.  She was more suited to be the person you encounter at a car wash asking if you want your windshield fixed, your car waxed, your interior lathered... it was really annoying.  I love Cartwright's so we will give them another try and we had a wonderful experience at Tonto B&G earlier in the day.  Let's just remember the goal of creating a great customer experience."
1,"HELL NO THIS ISN'T A THREE STAR ESTABLISHMENT!!!\n(and I hate exclamation points!)\n\nSeriously, I'm a little mad. \n\nWHO ARE YOU PEOPLE AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN EATING? \n\nWith all due respect Edinburgh and the fine and wonderful people I have met here, I have not seen such skewed ratings for places to eat in my life until I came here. \n\nFirst, you rate PIZZA F**KING PARADISE a FOUR STAR and this place you think sucks? I've always said \""The UK gets a bad rap, they have some damn fine food.\"" Well, I'm here to say - you do have damn fine food, you just don't respect it. Clearly it's not the food it's your wrong opinions. (I still love you guys though)\n\nIllegal Jack's is DAMN FINE fast food tex mex. I have eaten in Edinburgh for three weeks at 4 and 5 star Yelp rated places and this was FAR AND AWAY the best meal I had. \n\nThe fresh spicy salsa was out of control awesome. \nNext layer cheddar cheese. \nNext layer AMAZING veggie chili that filled me to the brim. \nNext layer damn fine black beans.\nNext layer Mexican rice. \nHeld in a CRISPY CRISPY DELICIOUS corn tortilla. \n\nAdded layer Guacamole that was... damn fine for some Guacamole served in Scotland. It's a-friggin million miles away from Mexico and they still managed to pull off the guac! Well done Illegal Jack. \n\nADDED BONUS: Buffalo Sauce. For real Edinburgh? You can't respect that there's Buffalo Wings here? I mean where else are you going to get Buffalo Wings? \n\nNow, if you come here expecting MEXICAN food, you won't get it. You know why? Cause BURRITOS are AMERICAN. Yes, I said it. We didn't invent the tortilla, and we didn't invent the bean but we did invent the carrying case. \n\nNB: \nAlmost all edible \""dishes\"" and things that allow you to \""eat and run\"" were invented in the good 'ole US of A. \n\nExhibit \n\nA: Hamburger Bun \nB: Ice Cream Cone \nC: Kabob stick (Yes teriyaki chicken put on a stick in California)\nD: Hot dog Bun \nE: Bread Bowl\n\nIf you have a hankering for food that MOST CERTAINLY DOESN'T SUCK, come one, come all, come here. \n\nThis shit is delicious. Anyone says different - we can take this outside!"
0,"Orange Table has a great ambiance and location. The menu is interesting and well thought out.\n\nThat being said, I have no plans on coming back. \n\nI've been coming here off and on for a couple years. Each time gets more and more disappointing. This particular time we arrived at 9:30 or so on a Saturday, just before the big breakfast rush. A good chunk of the tables were occupied, however there were a few available, probably about half full. The two of us gave our name and were seated in the waiting area.  As we sat, we noticed a gentleman, chilling out behind the counter, texting in plain view, generally looking lazy and slow. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, we were seated. Turns out Lazy McTexter was our server. He seats us, doesn't ask us what we would like to drink (we'd been waiting, we knew), and disappears for another 10 minutes. He comes back, I decide against coffee (theirs is delicious usually) and went with OJ. Big mistake. I understand fresh squeezed OJ has pulp, but this was ridiculous. I literally had to chew it. We ordered the food then too, no telling how long before he'd be back.\n\nFood came about 15 minutes after ordering. Not forever, but a little long for a breakfast menu. I ordered the eggs benedict, and my friend ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I know they're famous for the hash, but we've had it before.\n\nHere's the worst part about the whole situation, the food was good! The eggs benedict were some of the best I've had in the valley! The hollandaise was creamy with just a hint of citrus tart. Eggs were poached well, ham was good. \n\nThe pancakes were a little dry however. Not to worry, when you have dry pancakes and don't give a damn about calories, you just put a little extra syrup on it, right? We wave down our server (literally waved my hand in the air to get him), ask for the extra syrup, and he mutters that it will be extra. A little ridiculous to charge extra for a cup of syrup, if you ask me, but whatever, it can't be more than 50 cents right?\n\nWrongo, pal. $2.00! Two George Washingtons for a shot of maple syrup. Seriously?! I don't care how good it is, syrup ain't $2.00. \n\nThat was the kicker. To have service that terrible (note the other reviews) and then nickel-and-dime the customer like that is unacceptable. I worked in restaurants for the majority of my teens and 20's (everything from prep cook to bartender), and I think I have reasonable expectations when it comes to quality of service. Orange Table doesn't cut it. Adios."
1,"Rye and Woody Allen (corned beef and pastrami) - 20 bucks for an 8 inch high Everest of slim sliced beef between two pieces of store quality rye bread. Having had Katz's in Manhattan, I'd say that their pastrami on rye is still the winner. But, when in Vegas, Carnegie is a pretty decent substitute. \n\nComplimentary pickles (3 large, mostly dill and butter) were a nice touch. So was the iced coffee with free refills: almost a good deal when on the Strip; \""only\"" $3.50 for an approximately 20 oz glass. Table also has squeeze bottle horseradish sauce.\n\nOpen 24 hours; slow service. Probably the best perk of them all. If you want to save room for dessert (which is suggested if you like huge cheesecakes and black and white cookies!!), split your sandwich for $3 extra. To go bags were good enough for the plane. \n\nOther noteworthy interesting menu items: lettuce and tomato sandwich; breakfast items; bagels and fruit cups for lighter appetites; grilled cheese for vegetarians (but no veggie sandwich); pretty much, the usual large assortment of items on a typical New York deli menu."
1,"Spoon is probably one of the best restaurants in the Pittsburgh Area. I won't even review it because as excellent as my experience was, I'm not sure if I'm the caliber of foodie that can really write a meaningful review. I can't come up with the adjectives to fully elaborate on the Apps that we had which were the Garden vegetable baby mix green salad and bacon and eggs and my entree of Cassoulet. While this place was spendy, I thought that it was worth it!"
0,"SUCH a bad experience today!  In the past, the worst that happened, were the ditzy receptionists that called to ask for my payment again.  After I signed a receipt and my insurance covered the rest.  I'd have to call them back and have them double check their records. Yup. Paid.  Today was another level of unprofessional and money needy!  I'm never going back.\n\nI chipped a tooth while snacking on corn nuts like a loser.  Whatever, I have  dentist, so let's just fix it right? So I called Dentistry of Old Town, they said if I made it there by 4:30pm, I could get in.  I told them my private insurance is currently getting reinstated, but I'll pay cash.  It just needs to get fixed so I can go to work tomorrow without half a tooth. Easy, right?  So, I race from 5 hours away from my drive home after visiting family in NV and made it before 4:30pm. After waiting, they took me back and it took them 45 minutes to figure out how I payment works.  After getting the estimate, x-rays, and payment sorted out, they told me I had to leave and come back tomorrow ... The receptionists were useless.  Dr. Bradley was in the room next to me working on someone else.  They don't open until 8am and I needed to be at work with a tooth by 7:30am and they knew this at noon when I made the appointment.  \n\nThis place is disappointing and everybody who works there is useless.  Don't waste your time and 4 times what you should be paying! It's not worth all the stupidity, poor communication and paying the same bill 10 times.  \n\nOn a happy note, I found a non fake dentist who accepts payment plans and stays 30 minutes past his \""clock out time\"" for costumer service and to make an extra 1k. The receptionists didn't giggle and knew where they were too, so that was refreshing :)"
0,"Quite a disappointment. Service was very polite and friendly, but the kitchen was painfully slow. 3 different kinds of oysters but our waiter couldn't tell us the difference between them. The frog legs were tasty but very oily. The crawfish and trout was really salty. My boyfriend got the ribeye fillet and couldn't finish more than a few bites because the reduction was way too rich and pungent. \n\nBest part were the pretzel rolls, wasn't worth a $140 bill"
1,"I had recently written a bad review on this place because I had a bad experience with getting a replacement for a defective tank I bought from them.  I was dissatisfied with their response of no returns/exchanges.  I left my phone number and asked to be contacted by management.  \n\nI have since been contacted by the manager Andrew and he assured me they will be standing behind their products and will give me a replacement at no extra charge.  I no longer have the defective tank, but was told that it was ok in this specific stituation and that they wanted to make things right.  I want to thank Andrew for reaching out to me and correcting this situation.  \n\nIt means a lot to know that they take pride in their products and care for their customers.  You have taken my rating from 1 star to 5.  Thanks again!"

My wife is handicapped and had to go to the bathroom, they told her to walk over to the McDonalds which is about 100 yards away.\nMy wife got pissed and so did I, after my wife left the store I approached  a female displeased with their flip additude. When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. \nOne female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.\nOf course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.\nI told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.\nI've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.\nOf course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.\nThe customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.\nIf I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.\nIf Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.\nIf I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.\nVerizon is going to have to do a lot of butt kissing to keep me with them when the 2 years is up."

1,"YES YES YES! I have a new found love for Tryst! \n\nUntil I visited Tryst last weekend, my favorite place to be in Vegas was Tao. It probably still is. But let me just say that Tryst is running a close 2nd for sure! Beautiful decor, and above all else, we had a great experience here.\n\nWe got ourselves put on the guest list through their website (Please note: You must do this at least 7 days in advance and a promoter will text you with confirmation the day of). Also, THEY WILL NOT PUT A GUY'S NAME ON THE GUEST LIST! So make sure you register with one of the females in your party. Being on the guest list almost always saves you time waiting in line and reduces your cover, if you have to pay at all. \n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about Tryst is that the line at the door seemed very unorganized. We arrived at the club around 11 pm, where there was one single file line for everyone, and you had to fight for the attention of the ONE worker with a clipboard to notify them that you had a table or were on guest list. Otherwise, you continue to wait with those who are general admission. We waited about 15 minutes in line before I FINALLY grabbed a worker's attention, and then we were walked right in and did not pay any cover charges (1 male, 1 female). OK, that made up for waiting in line! :)\n\nWhen we got in, we made our way over to the bar and got drinks fairly quickly, and then were almost immediately drawn to the breathtaking waterfall, where we spent a few minutes taking pictures and warming up by the heaters. Beautiful place & it was just busy enough to be fun on a Friday night :) \n\nWe got a few shots from the pretty girls walking around with them, and had such a blast! Also, they have a pole there that anyone can get up & dance on.. Lots of people took advantage of that opportunity for sure! Great go-go dancers, and sexy bartenders. Very attentive staff (other than at the door) and an awesome place to be overall. I will be back for sure!"
1,"Excellent hotel.  Got a panoramic suite with a small bedroom with queen bed. Separate large living room with great view of strip.\n\nMore private than Wynn tower.  Encore European pool is really nice with a cool bar right on the pool deck.  Lots of spots in the shade at this pool.... Main Wynn pool is huge and a realy cool design, so check that one out, too.\n\nWe think it's better than Bellagio or Venetian/  palazzo, because it is more private without huge crowds of tourists walking the strip."
1,"Nice Asian coffee house reminds me of some of the places I visited back in Cali at jtown. Desserts are good, definitely will come back and try there honey toast and the coffee drink I tried was quite tasty. The place has pretty late business hours so definitely will take advantage of that especially since there is no coffee house that is open that late in the SW area."
1,The food was excellent!  So many great choices!  Salads and panini was delish!
1,"I don't know why it took me so long to start coming here. My default happy hour choice on Ellsworth is Harris Grill, and so I guess for a long time I just overlooked 1947 completely.\n\nI've been here a couple of times within the past month and have had good experiences. The first was for late night drinks with a group of friends. Long picnic tables on the back patio easily accommodated our group of eight. I'm a fan of eating (and drinking) outside, so we were all about the patio. They also offer a couple of tables out on the sidewalk (probably some good people-watching here... Ellsworth on a weekend night can be entertaining) and the main seating area inside of the restaurant is great as well. It's fairly dark and something about it just makes the place feel upscale and refined. \n\nAs for drinks, we ordered a variety of featured cocktails from the menu and everyone enjoyed them. I started with a Rock and Rye, which is one of their happy hour specials during the week (rye whiskey, lemon, orange, pineapple, rosemary, and rock candy). I followed that up with a classic Manhattan. Both were excellent and the service was quick.\n\nOn my most recent trip I ordered fish tacos (apps are 1/2 off during happy hour). I was fairly disappointed in these. There just wasn't anything special about them and to me they were bland. Salsa or anything with a little bit of a kick would have gone a long way  to help these. My friends ordered a variety of other apps and everything else seemed fine. Apparently their mac and cheese is amazing, so maybe next time I'll go that route.\n\nOverall it's a nice place to get drinks with friends. Service has been great each time and I'm glad to have another reliable happy hour spot in Shadyside!"

He keeps telling me that his \""watch guy\"" hasn't brought it back. Or, his watch guy has been out of town. Or, he will check with his watch guy and call me later in the day, which he never does. At this point, I will give up on my $100 watch just so I don't have to hear any more of his lies. DO NOT GO HERE under any circumstances! I also find it strange that no one else is ever in the store when I go in. Ever. Something strange is going on here."
1,"Adam is one of the best, most honest biz owners around. Oh and did I mention he freaking ROCK when it comes to IT whether it's hardware OR software. He has fixed 3 of our laptops and would recommend him to anyone looking for a quick repair to a company looking for IT support with hundreds of employees. Thanks Adam!!!!"
1,"Chicken burritttoooooo! Since this one is in the Marketplace, it's pretty much always busy. They are still good at getting you in and out though."
0,Many issues here. It took nearly 20 min to just get a drink. Then the 2nd drink took just as long and we informed we had plans in an hour before sitting down. Small things so far... But it gets worse\n\nThey charged me for drinks I didn't order. They spilled beer on my dinner. \n\nWhen I informed them of the over charge They ran my card twice!!! \n\nAs we got up they spilled catchup all over my wife's back and hair and on my expensive cowboy boots. \n\nWhen we told manager he said there is nothing he could do to make us leave happy. \n\nHe gave us a business card and said come visit again when he isn't busy :/ \n\nIt's an hour drive each way for us :(\n\nDon't do it. To many other nearby choices.
1,"This is easily the best gym I've ever been to. The old UNLV gym was a dank basement like facility, so UNLV built this beautiful gym two years ago.\n\nThe first floor has dozens of treadmills, elliptical machines, mats, a few dependent stair steppers and two working independent stair steppers. There are also racquetball courts and volleyball courts on the first floor. If you are a student the health center is also there, so if you need to see a doctor for something minor pop in and make an appointment. The locker rooms are also on the first floor,.\n\nThe second floor has a myriad of weight lifting machines and free weights. There are also a few elliptical and treadmills if you prefer to do cardio on the same floor you are strength training on. Most of the group classrooms are also on this floor, which leads me to another fantastic aspect of this facility, the group exercise classes that are included with your membership. From yoga to \""boot camp,\"" they have a class for all levels of fitness. Check out the schedule on the SRWC Facebook or pick up a physical copy at the front desk.\n\nThe third floor has basketball courts, offices and more group exercise rooms.\n\nThe four floor has an indoor track. It's got kinda sharp turns, and people like to walk in the wrong direction, but it is still nice.\n\nThe reason I've deducted one star is that they don't enforce most of the rules. People will goof around on the equipment, leave bags on the weight lifting machines, loudly drop weights that they can't handle and not wipe down seats. Oh and for some reason it takes 30 seconds to five minutes longer to check in if you have Scarlet and Gray (the program that compensates students who paid the fee before the gym was built)."
0,"Don't use your smartphone ticket app. Print your tickets out at home instead. You think you're saving ink and trees by doing the right thing but you'd be wrong. Rude and indifferent ticket takers and box office agents don't care. You pay exorbitant fees for tickets thinking they have readers that can read barcodes on phones but you'd be wrong again. You wait in line for them to tell you that their antiquated Palm Pilots can't scan the barcodes on your phone. Then you embarrassingly leave the line and go to the box office line to see 12 other people that are in the same predicament as you. Their smartphones are glowing with ticket master barcodes that cannot be read and now have to wait in yet another line for them to print out paper tickets. Had I known that the Palms still utilized technology from 2001 when they opened, I would have gladly printed it at home. Not the way I want to start a concert after shelling out my hard earned money. The ticket agents don't care and their managers give you a condescending remark when you voice your concern about being inconvenienced.  It's a shame because The Pearl is a stellar venue. Palms, get your act together, please."
0,"I don't like this place.  Uninventive sushi, unexcited staff, and shitty lighting that makes it impossible to read the menu.  About the only plus is it's proximity to other things you'd want to do with tourist friends, and the fact that there's some decent eye candy to look at while eating.  I had two rolls here this weekend for dinner and my bill was almost as much as an AYCE joint off the strip.  I remember their happy hour being good, but outside of that, go elsewhere.  Oooh, try Sushisamba, that's much better."
0,"wow! What a surprise this resto was for me. I have been to the Outback on Sunset and Green Valley and do not remember it to be anything like this one on So.Las Vegas Blvd.\nI had the burger topped with their 'bloomin onions' and fries as a side dish.\nMy friend had the ribeye and baked potato and a side salad.\nOur food came at a reasonable time.\nI noticed that both our dishes were inordinately shiny (translate to - greasy!) but I didnt think much of it. I didnt finish my burger (ate about a 3rd of it and boxed the rest) finished my fries and my friend polished off her plate.\nThen we had coffee and key lime pie.\nAfter dinner, we headed out to the mall to \""walk off\"" all that grease we had consumed.\nBut as soon as I left the restaurant, I felt my mouth dry up. Thirty minutes after shopping, my friend wanted to go get a long cold drink of soda and so did I.\nWe were both so very very thirsty.\nAfter much thought, we were thinking about what could have possibly triggered such voracious thirst in both of us.\nSodium.\nThat restaurant served our food laced with maximum doses of sodium. \nI realized, my body reacts to MSG, and that what happens to me - I get very thirsty and  a bit swollen. Sure enough~! \nI will never eat there again - ever! \nDont bring your kids there although I saw very many families with young ones gobbling up the food.\nThey put too much sodium, cook with way too much grease.\nSodium is used as a preservative. I hoped I wasnt eating week old ground meat. Or worse(!) below standard quality ground beef.\nAll I can tell you is that, the following day - I got the runs,\nEat at your own risk!"
1,Came here for my birthday! Loved the food and the wine pairings.
1,"Katy is great! I'm new to town and was looking for a good stylist. Tried Katy out using a Groupon and glad I did. She really listens and gets to know her customers. This is important because she is able to deliver and you leave a happy camper. Love the cut, she did lots of subtle layers in my hair and the color came out beautifully."
0,"The venue itself if quite charming.  Quite old school vegas while amenities offer plenty of comforts.\n\nHowever, the two older ushers that work there need to retire.  They are grouchy, rude and should be put out to pasture.\n\nOn my 2 trips to this showroom I have heard them insult and humiliate a man who was so large he needed a little extra help to be seated and a latino couple who were having a hard time understanding the ushers instructions.\n\nThere's never a need a need to make people feel bad!  Might be time to consider hanging up you colored blazer and staying home!"
0,"My family loves this place so we've been dining here for decades.  Even when I was a kid I knew it was mediocre at best.  After not being forced to dine here for several years I came (with the family of course) on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago.  The menu's changed since 1995 but the food and service are still sub par.\n\nWe started off with the spinach dip in a \""brioche\"" bread bowl.  First of all, don't insult my intelligence.  I can tell the difference between brioche and a sourdough bread bowl from Safeway. This appetizer was reminiscent of something I would've brought to a potluck ten years ago. \n\nMy sister got the lobster ravioli. Definitely a two star dish.  The sunrise sauce (creamy tomato sauce) was OK but the ravioli lacked any type of flavor - lobster or otherwise.\n\nMy brother got the penne quatro formaggio. This was actually the best thing on the menu but it was just glorified macaroni and cheese.  Don't try to trick us common Mesa folk with your fancy Italian. \n\nMom got the spaghetti and meat sauce.  I didn't taste it because once I smelled it I didn't need to. Ugh.\n\nI got the berry and candied walnut salad.  The spring mix was old and it was nothing special.  I was just going for the least disgusting and calorie laden item on the menu.  Mission accomplished. \n \nService was unremarkable - drinks were refilled but she was MIA quite a bit.   \n\nEating here reminds me of Thanksgiving.  I know that I'll be with my family and I'll leave full but ultimately unsatisfied."
1,"My favorite local restaurant, however I don't get here often enough.  Waitstaff is great, and decor is lovely, especially outdoors during the summer months, twice the hostess was a little snooty however food, decor and service outweigh her attitude. \n\nMy favorite dish is the scallops, and the butter lettuce with brie salad, simply delightful and or course their pretzel bread is to die for.  In fact their simple butter presentation with olive oil is also so good.\n\nTheir wine offerings are great and cocktails are creative and yummy. I would recommend for date or girls night out."
0,"I feel like this place is starting to take short cuts.  The Mac and cheese which I usually love from here was not as good the last couple of times.  The chicken didn't even taste like it was smoked.  Green beans were bland...maybe from a can.  The smoked sausage with pimento was still good, but anything is good drowned in cheese.  I am kind of afraid to go back because the last two times were so disappointing."
1,One of the best Mexican restaurants on the west side. Better than Lindo and definitely on par with Frank& Fina's. Can't wait to go back.
0,These people ripped me off. I ordered $15 worth of food and had an additional $30 added to my total without my knowledge I signed the receipt without noticing the total difference and I wasn't given a receipt. When I noticed the error and tried to correct it with the manager via phone I was shocked by his defensive nature and lack of concern over what his employee had done and his lack of care for his customers. He said he could not look up my receipt which I know is a lie and he did not offer to correct the error or offer any apologies trying to keep a long time customer. I also went into the store in an attempt to force someone to be accountable for what had happened and I was avoided. I disputed with my bank and because I had signed the receipt I lost the $30. What a scam they have going on and I wonder how many other customers they have done this too. I will never again go back and give them my money. BEWARE.
0,Do not shop here. You will regret it .Absolutely horrible! 15 day return policy is bogus. Tried to return a hat two days after I bought it because it shrunk which they said it wouldn't. They say that since I wore the hat it was not returnable. Which means they don't return anything. The two kids that run the shop don't k ow what manners are either because they were so rude.
1,"Definitely a sports bar for all around beer lovers.  I was expecting to see more Belgian ales..only one on the menu and was overwhelmed by I P A choices. Fries compete with Four Peaks fries...burgers there need some work as does the buns.  Overall, good atmosphere, tons of jocks and decent location.  South Chandler simply needs more bars!"
1,"this club is really good.\n\nThis club is run by the LIGHT group, they deal with promotions for LIGHT in the bellagio, the CARAMEL lounge and restaurants like fix.  Now the Light group is a little abrasive when interacting with their \""help\"" (like the bouncers and stuff) very hard to approach when trying to talk your way in or get simple information so for a guy like me, its tough.  \n\nAnyways the first time i went there it was two weeks after new years eve and from what i understand that was when it opened.  there were a lot of reporters taking pics and a huge line that we got to cut thanks to someone in our group.  it was bananas, the dj was excellent.  He played a mix of top 40 and old school R and B and rap. He mixed it in flawlessly.  The crowd was excellent and there were some celebrities on hand if you are into that kinda stuff.  the hiltons were just walking around, freddie mitchell and some other people i couldnt identify.  the vip booths at jet are the only places you can sit with those you have options.\n\nthere is a main room that plays the music i just mentioned.  then there are three side rooms:  a rock room, a rap room and a dance/trance room.  all of them have vip booths as well.  it is spaced out fairly well considering if it ever gets too crowded in the main floor, you could always go to side room to chill out, yet still be able to listen to music and get drinks with out a huge bar crowd.  \n\nall in all.  the place is impressive as far as music is concerned and catering to all types.  the clientele is beautiful, as you would expect from a vegas club and the ratio is fair.  however the drinks are expensive.  you are lookin' at 10 dollars a drink and more for shots.  if you dont find a way to either get on a glist or grab a pass you are paying a lot for entry also.  but the place is solid, and ive never had a bad time.  lights on the ceiling are great also."
1,"Wow!  These guys go over the top!  Absolutely five stars to all the folks who work here.  Not only did I receive top-notch customer service but they really saw to it (no pun intended) that I received everything that I ordered - and then some!  The lenses were received in and they didn't feel they were perfect so shipped them back and asked if I would mind waiting a bit longer.  These are my eyes; absolutely, I don't mind!  I am so very pleased with this place, I tell everyone who is \""blind\"" like me to go there.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Central Eyeworks!"
0,"Met a friend for dinner and drinks. Ambiance is wonderful. Good drinks. Absolutely horrible food that was very expensive, adding insult to injury. I ordered the halibut. The portion was thin, and about the size of the palm of my petite hand and very salty and dry. There was a very small serving of veggies. The cost of the dinner was $28.00.  My friend got the Lobster Pasta. A very small, overcooked serving for $25.00.\nTerribly disappointing! Would only return for HH."
1,This place is the quintessential American tavern. Cheap greasy food and beer. The couple times ive been in the staff is always friendly and attentive and the food is pretty good. I typically gonwoth the basic burger and fry but their ruban isnt too bad either.
0,"If you were getting this hotel for free, it would be alright to stay here.  But if you are paying, consider other places.\n\nIt is at the north end of the strip and it is a far walk/drive to get places.  The rooms were alright, but nothing special. The casino is old and just depressing.\n\nIf you are 40+ I am sure you would enjoy this place, it is full of the older crowd.  If you are young, you will hate this place as much as I did."
0,"One star for the service, rude, pushy and asked us the pay within moments of delivering food and getting the order wrong. Food is good, but not good enough to make up for the attitude."
1,"Went to Beauregard on a Saturday night as they were featuring a crawfish boil for $15. It was a great deal with crawfish, sausage, shrimp, potatoes, shrooms and corn all in the pot, and all you can eat. \n\nGood traditional Nawlins flavors and spice, washed down with an Abita Turbo Dog. \n\nTheir menu is a bit limited and is a blend of Cajun and Southern. The best bet appears to be their daily specials, from Red Beans and Rice on Mondays to short ribs on Saturdays."
1,Best frozen yogurt in the Valley. Very impressive!
1,Their lattes and Corditos are amazing.
0,"I don't understand the good reviews.  This is THE WORST food that I've had in a while. I should have known when I saw the bento box options were mostly American Chinese food. \n\nWe got chicken teriyaki and another order substitute beef.  The beef was tough!  And flavorless.  Plus there was something in it that looks like it could either be the stem root of an orange...or the eyeball of a small animal.  I'm not gonna look at it again because I'm sure (hope)  it's the former.  Veggies were also flavorless.  \n\nWe also ordered the Eagle and Angel rolls:  horrible.  The \""crunch\"" in the rolls were like stale bread crumbs, so the rolls were soggy and gross.\n\nI really hope that this review is published because, for some odd reason, most of the negative reviews are hidden.  \n\nDon't eat here."
0,"This review is written in behalf of my boyfriend. This review is for the service, not the food.\n\nIt's Summer in Vegas and it is easily at least 90-something degrees out here in the evening. He calls Dairy Queen to ask what time they closed today (Monday) and they say 9:30pm. He was IN the store talking to a staff member at 9:28pm. And the girl in the front says they turned off all their machines (he wanted a Blizzard) following the comment with \""and my watch is fast\"". HUH? If your watch says it's 9:30pm, then the doors should've been locked because the store is officially closed. From my personal experience, that is how businesses operate. Don't leave the store open and turn off your machines in an attempt to close and go home faster. \n\nSo for this Dairy Queen, make sure you get here even earlier than their already \n\""reDQlous\"" closing time if you want any machine-produced frozen goodies."
1,"Food was real good. The aura was real nice and also the employees was real attentive which is always a plus. Brought the kids along which may not have been a great idea, kids are welcomed but not as kid friendly as they didn't have kids cups or kids menus but LOVED everything else about this restaurant as a first timer here. When in town will be coming back to!!!!"
0,"Fast breakfast service. Sometimes a long wait for a table. Order less than you think you'd normally eat--portions are huge... Almost too big (borderline wasteful).  I've only had breakfast here.\n\nTo me, there is nothing really special about this place.  It seems pretty \""dump and serve\"". The gravy for the biscuits and gravy tastes like a powder mix with some sausage thrown in.  The biscuits are big, but tasteless and generally dry.   The breakfast prices are inexpensive for the amount of food you receive."
0,"The good - Everyone was very nice. The inside was cool. \n\nThe bad- They had no wifi - they offered a ethernet cable in the room - which did no help with my mac, iPhone, or tablet. \nThe room was dirty with mysterious stains on the floor, couch, and curtains. The bathroom fan didn't work. When I spoke to a manager about it, he did nothing. \n\nWe had been transferred from a tower suite (which was clean and nice) to a pyramid suite so we could be closer to family - we were charged the same price but the room was a downgrade (to say the least). We said we didn't want to change if it was not as nice, and were told it had the same amenities. \n\nCoffee!!! They did not have coffee available in our room. They said it was a fire hazard, and it made me wonder about if I should plug in my flat iron. I was told if I bought a coffee pot and had it in my room it would be confiscated. One morning I thought I would have coffee brought up to us $25 for a pot of coffee - $5/ cup. So with our group it would have cost us $60 for 5 people to have coffee and it would have been an hour wait. \n\nEven motel 6 has wifi and coffee figured out."
0,Absolutely terrible service.  The waitress ignored us while checking her nails.  Drinks are watered down and overpriced.  It's a 2 drink minimum and the entire place was empty.
0,Read Yelp reviews which indicated a record of very good work delivered and trust. Then found a very disappointing process attempting to secure an appointment to get an estimate. Called office number and was promised a return call to set an appointment.No call came. Called again and did recieve a return call. Scheduled an appointment and then the estimator was a no-show. Called back to main number and empathy was low and no accomodation for two service failures was provided. Even got a little lecture from the scheduler about how busy they are. Really? So am I. Gave up and started searching for another provider.
1,"I went to the North in Tucson once for a birthday party and was not impressed by what I got for the price. Well a trip to this one completely changed my mind about the modern Italian restaurant. \n\nI met a friend at North on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy so we put our name in for a table. However, we quickly snagged two seats at the bar which were just perfect.\n\nWe decided to just go ahead and eat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and made the experience great. My friend and I quickly ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share. The Sangria was delish, and I think a pretty good deal. \n\nAfter perusing the menu we both settled on the baked ziti. At 16 dollars I was hoping I was going to get my money's worth. It was so yummy. My friend also really enjoyed her ziti as well. I left North feeling like I got a top notch dining experience. I'm so glad I gave it another chance. Based on the food and service, this is a great restaurant."
0,"This place gets 2 stars instead of 1 star because of the price.  \n\nProbably one of the cheapest hotels you can stay at (off the strip).  The rooms are huge and have pretty nice views; however everything inside the hotel/room/casino looked like they haven't been replaced since the hotel opened.  Everything seemed old and outdated.  The decor needs a facelift.  The lights in the bathroom didn't turn on, showering in the dark was fun.  Didn't bother calling the front desk because that likely won't accomplish anything.  Front desk reps were rude and didn't really seem to want to help.  \n\nI'd only go back if I didn't have to pay for a room."
0,"Not only did my boyfriend and I get food poisoning from here once (and know several other people that have too) but the last time we were there, my boyfriend walked by a wall with pictures on it, one of the frames was broken, badly, and he sliced his arm open and bled for an hour. We informed 2 waitresses about the frame, and it was not removed the entire night. \n\nUnacceptable and dangerous."
0,The desert was pathetic. The food was not so good.
0,"very nice, pretty club, women bathing in tubs in the entrance, other women chillin on couches touchin each other, nice buddha statues everywhere.\n\nother than that...whack and way overcrowded!\n\nfire hazards must not fade the owners of this club becuase when we were inside it just felt un-safe and packed beyond capacity. it was like one dark room after another of too many damn people. dance floor was crowded as hell to the point where all your dance moves consist of nothing but upper body movement. \n\nlooks nice, but eh after a few minutes of trying to find somewhere to groove you get tired...find a better spacious club where you can dance with people and not shadows."
1,"Barefoot Sanctuary is a place where I can call home when I want to relax, and be myself, away from the hustle of the city, life! It's my sanctuary, and a place for me to come together with great new friends. It's a community within Whole Foods, a totally unique place to have a yoga studio! Can't resist the muffins on the way out..."
1,"This review is for the hot pot (huo guo) and the hot pot only.  For the poor souls not in the know, hot pot is a pot of boiling soup, into which you put raw meat, vegetables and noodles to cook at your table.  The soup can be anywhere from mild to spicy in flavor, and you can also get the yin- yang, which is one side spicy and one side mild.  I used to live in Chongqing, China, which is the hot pot center of the universe, so I was delighted when a Chinese friend told me she knew a place for hot pot in Arizona.  \n\nWe were greeted by exceptionally friendly waitstaff.  \""Are you drunk?\"" the waitress asked me, with a smile.  \""Um, no...\"" I said.  \""Oh! Oh no... I mean do you want a drink!\"" she corrected herself, blushing furiously.  We laughed, knowing the evening was off to a good start.  \n\nWe ordered the spicy hot pot... the kind that hurts so good and makes you sweat, and went to the buffet to load up on meats, and veggies.  The selection was pretty good.  Lotus, lamb, pork, beef, prawns, tofu, eggplant, a variety of greens, noodles... there was also some stuff I'm less keen on like chicken hearts, but the beauty of a buffet is that you don't need to touch anything you don't want.  I'm an omnivore, but vegetarians could make a good meal out of the veggie offerings in a hot pot.  \n\nThe waiter was very attentive throughout.  My friend and I agreed that he was the happiest looking waiter we'd ever seen, almost to the point of being strange.\n\nAfter we had been eating hot pot for about two hours, we put up the white flag and moved on to dessert.  The fruit was pretty picked-over, but the little cakes were good.  I also tried the skanky looking scoop-it-yourself ice cream and decided buffets should stick to soft-serve.  \n\nAs I indicated at the beginning, I didn't try the other foods at the buffet.  They looked nasty, but I am not a fan of pre-cooked buffets and American-style Chinese food in general. \n\nPrice for dinner was about $20 pp.  A little steep, but it's a special treat, not an every-day meal."
1,Scott hull is a master at diagnosing problems that other cant.  He guarantees all his work and goes out of his way to always take care of the customer.  He does what he says and says what he does. I highly recommend him.
1,"Been here at least 20 times over the past two years - not because it sucks. Ncounter is a great little restaurant, ambience has a modern/industrial feel and the location is perfect. Great food, great service and reasonable prices - most importantly they seem to be very consistent."
1,"The Old Fashioned, totally rocks for its bar, restaurant, and awesome location at the epicenter of Madison.\n\nIt goes without saying that their Old Fashions are awesome, every food item I've ever tried in my 3 visits to the place has been delicious (especially the cheese curds).\n\nA kick butt selection of Beers from Sconee to boot!!! Great place to come to meet friends or with the family. I'll be back the next time I'm in MadTown for a game or a visit."
0,"I went to the opening of Club Nikki last night. So this will be a review one the club portion only.\n\nIt was a disaster! The club was so disorganized. You couldn't tell where general admission , table reservations, general admission, etc. was. I've been to several clubs and this one was a HOT MESS. I am hoping that it is just beginners jitters. Seriously, I haven't been that frustrated in a club in a long time, especially since these places literally kiss your ass when you have bottle service.\n\nGet it together, Nikki Beach. They layout and look of the place is pretty awesome and the fact that the Tropicana keeps telling all the big casino corporations to effe up, I want it to do well."
1,"Checked in here yesterday for some good home style food.  At least that's what all the reviews say, right?  Let's just start off by saying that they truly do treat you like family.  Service was very warm and they're genuinely glad to see you there.  I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  Great flavor and I absolutely loved the texture of all the caramelized onions and crispy corned beef hash.  Very good.  I also was curious to see what all the hype was about the Pots of bread.  Meh, it was ok, but to me, nothing to write home about."
1,"This is a nice little intimate restaurant and I really enjoyed my visit here. My friends and I came here and we had way more to eat than we could handle! For appetizers we got the calamari, garlic bread dip, and caesar salad. The calamari was so yummy, lighted battered and fried, not overly greasy and soggy. Both the garlic bread and calamari came with a marinara dipping sauce which was a nice compliment to the dish. Then we ordered the crusted baked salmon, thin crust pizza, chicken marsala, and zucchini strings. The crusted baked salmon and zucchini strings were probably my favorite dishes out of everything. The salmon had a nice crunchy baked crust on the outside and was tender and juicy on the inside. Not too bland either, salmon tends to be if you don't prepare it right. I tend to like fried stuff so maybe that's why I was drawn to the zucchini strings. Little bits of zucchini lighted fried, I do wish they had a dipping sauce for it, but it was like eating little veggie fries. The chicken marsala was a bit heavier to eat. It had a lot of sauce and cheese, but the chicken wasn't too dry. The thin crust pizza was a nice addition to our meal. Just a simple cheese, marinara, and basil pizza on a nice warm crust, yum! This restaurant fits in with the Italian feel of the Palazzo. You wouldn't think it was an Italian restaurant when you first walk in with the lighted candles and fancy modern d\u00e9cor, you'd probably expect the checked red and white table clothes instead. Our table was right by the window so we got a great view of fireworks from the TI show across the street.\n\nThe club is also worth mentioning. The downstairs restaurant becomes a lounge at night and upstairs is a full club. The first time we were there on a Saturday night it was way too packed so it was hard to move around and dance without being bumped into. The second time we came on a Sunday night it was a better crowd. They aren't as pushy and rude like they are at Tao, probably because Tao has a younger crowd. They play good music, all of the latest and greatest and more hip hop R&B kind of stuff, I hate it when they play too many techno or trance songs! How do you dance to those? The d\u00e9cor of the club is very similar to Tao in the Venetian, very dim and lots of dancers."
1,Great service! I needed my phone glass and LCD replaced. They had the parts in stock and fixed it within 10 minutes.
0,"terrible...just terrible. Not a lot of choices for food , especially seafood. Most of the stuff were bland...or just not edible. One of the mint mousse desserts tasted like toothpaste...they displayed so many cupcakes but didn't have a single one out for customers...what the heck? Sushi was bad...even the king crab legs and cocktail shrimp which I was looking forward to was a big disappointment. The shrimp was just ok but the crab legs tasted like seawater...i've had better. Fruits were dry and tasted like it had been washed  in water. For $50 a person i would definitely not come back! Don't even bother to try this place...their waiters drop dirty dressing dripping rags on you as they walk by...it pissed me off and when I told somebody they just handed me another rag to wipe myself off and replaced my chair. What more can they do? I don't know...but I wasn't a happy customer when I left...When I asked my friend which item she thought was the best..she responded with..\"" my soda\"" so that really shows you how great this place is. For buffets, just stick with Bellagio or Rio."

0,Contacted Joe Fraser after meeting him at a home and garden show he came out to give a bid which at this time we are to blame for not demanding a breakdown on everything that needed to be done. They started the work (on time) and I was told several times that they wanted a deposit and then a second payment and then the final when all was done well that should have been a red flag we paid the deposit I finally had to call and this is the best part the owner of Addision well good luck they are so chicken shit that they will not even return the call....great business ethics there.So when they finally came out to start the work they wanted more money and hadn't even pulled a weed but Joe kept telling us that they would not take final payment until the work was complete well here it is two days after they left I have several dead plants (no water running to the plants) guess that is why they are dead water lines tied off so no water running thru them. And yet again another false promise from Joe Fraser himself to replace the plants and make sure all is correct \nWhen Joe called for final payment suddenly the amount due was $700.00 more than agreed upon so this is what I was left with.  We paid the final yes i know my mistake and now I am left with buying new plants and irrigation heads and trying to get the water to even work for now.\nMy advise STAY AWAY and if you decide to use them take my advise to this if they hand you a flier offering $250.00 off or Free Lighting Package do not be a fool because that will not happen it is all a scam....
0,"There aren't a lot of great places to eat in charlotte and I was hoping Kabob grill would be different. For the most part the food was good, not fabulous or 4 star worthy, but pleasant enough. \n\nThe chicken kabob was nicely cooked, but they went a little overboard on the seasoning. The basmati rice was good (I'm a big fan of rice) and the potato harra was okay, but way too spicy. The grape leaves, however, were disgusting--way too bitter, they tasted similar to grape leaves I bought at whole foods a long time ago (big mistake). \n\nI guess in charlotte this would be considered 4 or 5 stars, but for someone who has tasted the real deal, Kabob grill doesn't quite live up to it's high star rating."
1,So my second experience was alot better!I did come hungry and I ordered one of my go to breakfast items I eat which is chicken fried steak and eggs with country potatoes. They have redeemed themself and I enjoyed a great meal with great service.I'll be back to have this again
0,Don't believe their posted hours. We got there 30 min before closing and we're sent away. Very annoying.
0,"Uncle Sam's has really gone down hill. \nThe staff has gone from polite, to indifferent, to borderline hostile. Simple requests are ignored - when the error is pointed out - they become indignant.  Turning to the food... the sandwiches are now 90% lettuce and served cold.  If the old adage about judging a kitchen by the state of the bathroom is to believed - stay away."
1,"This is my very first review on Yelp. I'm been an active user and decided to share my secret favorite place - Eden's Grill.\n\nLooking for the finest Mediterranean food in the valley?  Eden's Grill is the place to go. Consider the Gyros, Chicken and Beef Kebab combination for two.  It's our favorite dish, since it allows us to have it all. Did I mention the rice? Covered in golden raisins and almonds- WOW. \n\nEnded the evening Nehren's Wedding Cake for dessert. I dislike cake, but I'm still thinking about how good it was. Try it."
0,"Was here for Interbike 2009 and I have to say this place needs some serious work.\n\nFew key highlights:\n-Setting up for the show, we were in grave danger of getting run over by fork lifts speeding around the floor at 30 mph--this seemed to happen when we were breaking the show down as well; the workers seem a bit lax in their regard to safety\n-food is HORRIBLE---for example they want $1.75 for a piece of half-rotten fruit and almost $10 for a crappy salad! don't even try! just sneak in your own or escape somewhere with real food\n-services we ordered for the show (including the operation of a keg) did not go over very smoothly.  \n\nthis is just a taste of what you can expect from the Sands convention center.  good luck!"
0,"Pros:  Its cheap, and its the only pyramid shaped hotel in Vegas. The casino and other general areas of the hotel are well maintained, good location.\n\nCons:  Rooms are dated and not very clean including the bathroom, furniture falling apart, hole in the wall, flickering lights, shower turns off for no reason, toilets that don't flush.  The elevators in the pyramid are nauseating.\n\nAs I stated earlier, its cheap and you get what you pay for.  Not horrible, but I will not be back at least as an overnight guest.  You can find other bargains on the strip with better quality."
0,"I only give one star because there is not an option for zero star. I'm a Brazilian from Curitiba. I tried this place about 3 times across the last 6 years. Each time the place had a different owner and we were told things would improve. They need to burn this place down and start all over. It was terrible each time! Please don't waste money, time at this place. Zero quality, poor service! Nothing Brazilian about this place. Fogo de Chao is the best Brazilian restaurant in town at the moment. Fogo de chao is worth every penny, not this place. Food was cold, the food tasted and looked old. Nothing positive to say. I like to enjoy good fresh food and nothing about this place was good to me. (or my group that also did not enjoy this place)"
1,"Fresh ingredients, great prices, and hefty portions.  Myself and two other co-workers got sandwiches from here and could all only eat half of the foot-long sandwiches we got because they had so much meat."
1,"Stopped by here on a Saturday night for dinner with friends.... and ended up staying like 4 hours!\n\nWe ordered drinks, hookah, and dinner menu items.\n\nThe food was delicious, and the homemade pita bread was outstanding.\nThe hookah was delicious... but the real standout here was the service.\n\nEverytime I thought we may need new coals... BAM, there they were offering us new coals.  If we were close to being out of a drink, BAM, another drink would appear!\nThey even brought over complimentary smoothie tastings, and gave us $10 off coupons for our next visit.\n\nAfter 9:30pm there was a live band that played inside and people danced on the dance floor, and there was a belly dancer performing on the patio!\n\nLoved loved loved it."
0,"Their one-size-fits-all approach just doesn't work for all kids. After two-and-a-half months of bi-weekly classes and private lessons, my son was more fearful of the water than when we started and had made little progress learning to actually swim. I spoke with his instructors (four different ones) and expressed my displeasure with the management, yet nothing was done. I was told to just keep trying and eventually my son would get used to swimming and all would be fine. I trusted this advice for a few days, but drew the line when he screamed in fear and became physically ill when we approached the pool. \n\nManagement REFUSED to give me a refund when I withdrew him from class. Instead, they informed me that they would retain a credit for the unused classes to be used for up to a year (as if I would be going back!). I guess they'd prefer I keep bringing my son back and risk scarring him for life. I asked to speak to the owner, but was told it wasn't an option. I guess leaving a negative review here and spreading the word to all of my friends is my only recourse. \n\nBy the way, after just nine days with a private instructor from another school, my son was swimming like a fish AND looked forward to each lesson. He now loves swimming. Clearly there's something wrong with Water Wings' methods, philosophy, and management."
0,"Ok this was my third try and the last.  The first two times I went for pho at lunch.  Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me I should have to wait 20 min for pho) and my pho ga was MEH (I believe that was beef broth in my ga-LAZY).  \n\nThis time I got crispy rolls and BBQ pork vermicelli and the service was markedly improved.  The crispy rolls were the best I have ever had and I loved the fresh fixings that came with them.  I love spicy food but found it odd that their fish sauce is spicy.  I've eaten at lots of Vietnamese places in silicon valley and the fish sauce was always sweet.  \n\nThe pork was severely overcooked.  Most pieces were the consistency of jerky; some were so hard I couldn't tear them in half with my fingers. \n\nIf this is authentic Vietnamese, I'll take the Americanized version where my fish sauce is sweet and the meats are tender and juicy, thank you very much!"
1,I'd give it more stars if they brought back the California turkey sandwich.
1,"With the exception of Caesar's Bacchanal, I've tried every buffet on the strip and this one is still my favorite, food-wise.  (In terms of interior design, I've got to hand it to the Wynn).  Lots of choices, everything tastes great, and I love how they offer a number of original dishes you wouldn't normally see at a buffet.  The only downside is where it's located in the hotel.  It's set off in an abandoned corner, far from the casino end of things.  Kind of weird but still worth the trek."
0,Horrible service. Drinks were made incorrectly and the food wasn't that good. Walk across the street and go to hi fi or whiskey row
0,"After my friend had been super excited and raving about this place, I was disappointed that it's really not that great for vegetarians or vegans. The burger I got just didn't have a tasty flavor. Just kind of sour and sickly sweet. I actually got sick of eating it and stopped..which HARDLY EVER happens to me."
1,"Great pastries!  Always friendly service at this small, family owned and operated restaurant. Make sure to stop in for one of their delicious daily specials.  The beans and greens with hot sausage are the best I've ever had!"
0,"Very slow this morning, thought coming early we'd miss the church crowd however with only two tables still had to wait five minutes to be sitted, the one sever for the place and he wants to be social and talk family with one of the other tables. \n\nThey gave us the special menu Monday through Saturday for breakfast with special prices, so when my husband wanted to order, they informed him it would be two dollars price difference. He decided to order a full stack pancakes and side of sauage, what he got was a short stack ( two pancakes) and his sauage. He's still hungry!\n\nI ordered the BTA which was the bacon omelete, hash browns and toast, mine was good! \n\nService was poor waited on refills never came, asked for check took forever and check out we took it up ourselves! Their pies are good!"
1,"The last few weeks I have been in and out of this Napa way too many times and Thankfully they are a helpful bunch. I'm not saying they are Head Mechanics... but they are knowledegable and can even help the women that walk in to the store that don't know what a Radiator Cap is. \n\n- The Customer Service is A-OK... Just depends on how lucky you are on who you get that day. \n- The Cleanliness of the Store is A-OK... Its an automotive store... It can't be spotless!\n- The Selection of In-Stock Parts & Other Vehicle needs it Awesome. They almost \nALWAYS have what I need for my Truck in store & If not then its usually a 24 Hour Turn Around... How convenient is that! \n- Hours are AWESOME as well, 7 Days a Week... Hey Discount Tire you need to get on this ship & Join the Open 7 Days a Week, Yes Even Sunday Businesses! \n\nKeep up the good work guys... Will be in soon for more parts!"
1,"A place I can always count on!  I love gambling at Palace station.  Best of all, Oyster bar has the best Alaskan chowder.  Lots of chunky seafood.  The only thing I don't like is the very long wait time to get seated.  Even after seated, it takes an extra 45 minutes for the food to arrive.  Expect and average 2 hour wait at any hour of the  day.  Even so, it's well worth the trip every time to go to vegas."
0,Really sucked today. Also a bathroom tells me a lot about a restaurant & I literally almost threw up when I went to the bathroom. This place is disgusting. Staff is not friendly. Go somewhere else!!
0,"I stopped in here for dinner recently to see how the place looked after their recent \""remodel\"" and I was surprised to see that even though there were improvements made to the exterior (fresh paint, expanded parking lot, and nicer patio) the inside looked exactly the same except they had replaced the rundown, ugly, uncomfortable tables and chairs with others that were only slightly less ugly and uncomfortable. Everything else was exactly the same, including the layer of grime over all the fixtures, walls, and flooring. I was willing to overlook that since we usually only do takeout anyway but once we ate our food my husband and I both agreed that we would not come here again. The quality of food has been going down the last couple of months but this was a new low. I have never liked the place itself but at least I thought the food was decent but nothing we ordered this last visit was even edible.  Dry, crumbly tamales, burnt tortilla chips, and carne asada that tasted like the meat had spoiled. The worst part was the crispy taco that was disgustingly soggy and filled with a substance that looked like dog food and tasted like what I would imagine that canned dog food tastes like. I mean, it was worse than Taco Bell. Seriously.\n\nThere still seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in the door, again mostly take-out orders, so I guess their customers are very loyal or else not everyone thinks it's gotten as bad as I do. I think most of their loyal fans keep coming back since it is so cheap, but there are lots of better options for cheap Mexican food in Chandler."
0,I was very very unhappy with the David's Bridal in Las Vegas when I was using that location for them to steam my dress the day before my wedding.  I dropped my dress off at 10 am when they opened and told them I have to pick it up at 5pm that day.  I had made an appointment several weeks before the wedding.  When I got to the store to pick up my dress they could not find it at first then they located in the front of the store and it had never been touched.  Then they told me that they will complete in less then 10 minutes and I told them I don't have the time and this is why I made a appointment.   We had dinner plans that night and we had to sit there for over 30 minutes and they were acting like it was ok and there is nothing wrong.  I had to sit back there with my sister-in-law to help me poi t out all the wrinkles that they were not getting.  It seemed more like a joke to them and that they did not see the issue with this.  The store manager just stayed by the front door and did not even get involved.   I will be posting a comment about this store on yelp and other places I can.  I was very very upset and unhappy I was treated by them
0,"I really wasn't in the mood for a buffet so I walked right past the one in the Excalibur on my way to see what Luxor had in the way of a coffee shop.  I wanted food cooked to order for me.  My food came out really fast.  I would be real surprised if any of it did not come from a warming tray.  The eggs were watery, the corned beef hash was dried out, I could only deal with part of the potatoes, the toast served wrapped in a basket was too cold even when it first got there to melt the butter.  The orange juice was really good and the decaf was ok.  \n\nThe service was good and friendly.  The chairs were comfortable to lounge back in but not very comfortable to sit up to the table in.\n\nOverall I was not really impressed paying $5 more plus tip for the same quality of food I could have gotten from the buffet."
1,"Great steaks, salads, ambiance, decor. Highly recommend coming."
0,Service is lacking to say the least.  There is literally one other couple in here and after 10 minutes we have water.  I guess that is why they need to offer groupons to get customers in here.  Live and learn.
1,Still really good food. There seems to be more people now going here because the other station Oyster bar is closed for renovation. Still worth the wait. JJ the Master Chef worked his magic and made an exceptional Combo Pan Roast. As always ate it to the last drop. You know a place is good when most of the people you sit next to are locals.
1,"My husband and I are always willing to try new places! \n\nWe were greeted by a guy who sat us right away. Our waitress came by and brought us waters to start. Being first timers, we asked our waitress her favorites on the menu. She was so helpful, nice and patient with us as we decided on our order. Our food came out quick, hot and tasty. Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner and our waitress checked on us a couple times to make sure we were satisfied and liked our food.\n\nThe least friendly person in the whole place was the cashier. He didn't say anything to us except to tell us our total. He didn't even offer me my receipt, I had to ask him for it.... probably not a big deal to most people, but I expected the great service until I walked out the door. \n\nWe'll definitely go back to try other things."
1,"I work in Oakland, so this is my home away from home in the morning! I love this particular Crazy Mocha for so many reasons: the location, the morning barista, and let's not forget the coffee and tea! I also love that they have partnered with LoyalTree, a rewards program for those with smartphones. The only drink I've had that I didn't like was the chai latte. It tasted like how a spiced candle smells! Other than that, every latte I've had has been excellent! With very little seating, this location can get a little crazy in the afternoon, but it's always quiet and cozy in the morning."
0,"I was disappointed in this company.  I purchased their package for the strip night tour based on price and length of the flight.  There are many vendors and I wish I would have selected another.  It turned out that the price was higher than quoted on the internet, because it did not include fuel surcharge, but there was no mention of the fuel surcharge in the \""Best of Las Vegas Tours.com\"" description.  Also, the BOLVT website said the flight time was 20-25 minutes.  When the flight began, the pilot announced it was 10-12 minutes.  When I contacted BOLVT with my complaint about the discrepancy, they said it was a typo on their webpage (which they have now corrected).  The time it took to get to the facility, wait in the terminal, shuttle to the launch pad and wait for another tour to go before ours, then the extremely short trip of 10 minutes, where I was cramped into a middle seat and couldn't see much of anything, then waiting about a half hour in the shuttle after the trip before they bussed us back to the terminal, was not worth the time and money.  \n\nI was very disappointed in the reception and processing in the terminal.  The person working at the desk was a brand new employee with no formal training.  She was causing a lot of stress with the customers by insisting she needed a \""voucher\"" not an email printed confirmation of the reservation.  It turned out my name was in the system, but she had me very concerned for a few minutes.  Then the surprise extra charge, even though the Heli USA confirmation email said that after my deposit the \""Total Due at the Terminal is XXX\"" which included taxes and fees -- that was not true.  The total was an additional fuel charge added on.  Once my son and I finally were told our reservation had been processed and we could be seated in the terminal, where it was extremely warm and not air conditioned, I was already regretting that I had booked the reservation. The lines were extremely long, and nobody seemed to know what was going on.  Someone came out and asked for groups 3 and 4 to go to another room for a safety video, and then I realized that we were not told we were assigned to a group.  I had to go back to the front desk to find out what group we were assigned to.  \n\nIn the helicopter, they cram 6 people into a tiny cabin space.  I think the only people who got to see much were sitting next to the window on the inside that faced the strip.  I was in the middle. The person on the other (outside) window would not have been given a good view either direction because we did a circle around the strip.  There was a very confusing tutorial about how to work the gadget that controlled the headphones. The music really sucked and needs to be improved.  The pilot was boring.  A little bit of humor might have helped."
0,"Tiramisu is way too sweet (and why sugary, nondairy paste instead of mascarpone?) and the espresso can best be described as mud."
0,Went here on the 4th and it wasn't too pleasant. They sat us in a tiny confined booth with a family who really wanted space. So by the time we sat down we were really on top of one anthers space. The meal was ok but the friend chicken rice was TERRIBLE! That's our favorite item there and it was the worst thing we've eaten. I noticed they use a huge cube of butter while the other ones I've experienced have the butter softened in a metal bowl. The rice had absolutely no flavor what so ever. The Pina Colada was yummy! Will I eat here again? Nope not at this one.
0,"I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was \""is there booze???\"" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.\n\nSo you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food. \n\nI thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out."
0,"Yet again, another place that I really wanted to like.  Its a bit far from my home but it came with really really high recommendations from SEVERAL of my friends.   But sadly it was again not to be......\n\n(Side note,  I really need to write some positive review, I look like a complainer on here!) \n\nYet again, the staff was friendly, funny and extremely personable.  If I could rank the attitude of the staff I'd give it 5 stars!  Our server was fun but couldn't seem to keep my drink refilled (grand total 2 refills in 1 1/2 hours).  The time from order to eating was REALLY fast (which, in retrospect should have been a clue).  The fish was not fresh... I mean NOT fresh, the flavors were very flat, and the sauces (particularly the eel sauce) tasted close to pond water.....lightly flavored. \n\nI'm also a bit petty about green-tea ice cream.  When done well it is unlike any ice cream in the world.  The green tea ice cream we were served was blasphemous.  In Japan I'm pretty sure you'd be arrested for serving something like that,  let alone charging us for it when it was obvious (by the barely touched bowls) that we found it offensive to the tounge (and to green tea ice cream everywhere).\n\nTo sum up,  the only thing that prevented this from being a 1 star review was the staff.  Sadly for them,  the place is a restaurant, not a frat party....I rate by the quality of the food, not the quality of the guests......unless they are female....and sadly,  the only hotties there were 1: with us and 2: already spoken for."
0,Service was horribly slow and not very friendly.... Would NOT suggest eating here.. 50 minutes and still not cooking and no refil!
1,Great shop! Watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish!\n\nTried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside! Yum!
1,"I LOVE RED CARPET VIP!!! And highly recommend them, especially our VIP host J-Mar! I never write reviews for yelp, but I cannot say enough great things about this company's professionalism, responsiveness, and trustworthiness! So a five-star review is warranted!\n\nI went to Las Vegas for my sister's bachelorette party with 11 girls during Cinco de Mayo / Mayweather vs Maida fight weekend. You can only imagine how crazy crowded and expensive everything in Las Vegas can be! We wanted to do a day club at Wet Republic and table service at Light, some of the most in-demand clubs in Las Vegas. I wanted us to have a VIP experience by skipping long lines, the best daybed / tables at these clubs and hassle-free time with my group at a fair price. Red Carpet VIP did not disappoint! J-Mar was there to greet us at the door as soon as our limo pulled up to the venue. He walked us past all the long lines into the day club. No waiting! I loved every second of it. He also hooked us up with one of the best daybeds that was central to the pool overlooking directly at the stage where Afrojack performed!  Blew my mind! He and his colleague Derek made sure our party was taken care of the whole time. \n\nI've price compared the services of this group with other VIP hosts and will say that their pricing is stable. I got quotes from other companies and their prices and fluctuated tremendously. Made me feel like I was getting jipped! Red Carpet VIP sent me quotes 2 months before our event, and the pricing was still the same when I booked with them the week of the event. I never felt pressured at anytime to use their service, but willingly gave them my business because they were not pushy, were trustworthy and professional in the way they conducted business. I only needed to provide a $50 deposit to secure the reservation! (Other companies were requiring a $200-$500 deposit. That is ridiculous and made me uncomfortable.) Red Carpet even forwarded me a payment link where all the girls could pre-pay their portion of the dues with their credit cards / debit cards. It shows you realtime status of all the payments received. I love this service because I didn't have to collect cash to close out the tab after a day of drinking. Not to mention, the cost was well controlled and transparent to all the people in my party because all gratuity, taxes, and service fees were already included in the price they quoted me. The electronic contracts and invoice they sent me to sign was super high-tech and easy to do. Another testament to their level of service!\n\nI plan to return to Las Vegas and will definitely use them again! Without any hesitation!"
0,"One of our worse dinning experience in Madison. The basement location could be quaint but is so stuffed with tables and overcrowded that once you are seated, you are jostled and bumped by every passing patron and server. The food is defiantly overpriced for the rudimentary facility and the level of service (minimal and brusque). Sadly, the pasta we ordered was barely passable. \n\nMy wife and I rushed to arrive before the nightly restaurant rush so we could be sure to get a table. There were a few open when we arrive, but they would not seat us because we were waiting on another couple in 15-20min. I explained that we would order appetizers and drinks while we waited, but they would not even take our names until the whole party arrive. The other couple arrived in 15 minute, but by then the place had filled and we ended up waiting more than an hour for a table."
1,I cant get enough of there medium spicy boneless wings.  They are my favorite in town.  \n\nThere lunch specials make the please more reasonable.
0,"Date of visit: Saturday October 04,2008\n\nChristian Audigier...what a disappointingly dull nightclub.\n\nWe arrived on the scene at approximately 11:00pm to find more bouncers standing idly by than club-goers in line. This is usually a very good indication the club itself has more short comings than merits.\n\nPros: \n1. Music was great, IMHO. There was a little of everything for most people.\n2. The patrons were decently attractive enough for the most part. \n\nCons: \n1. Mixed drinks were extremely weak. I had three canberry-vodkas in an hour span, and was still sober enough to wonder if there was a better club within walking distance.\n2. There were no places to sit, aside from the \""rip off\"" bottle service areas.\n3. It's a relatively small club, made even smaller with VIP roped off areas. On the plus side, if you don't dance this maybe the place for you.\n\nThe night ended for me when we had to look for our drunk friend. We found him about an hour or so later, wandering the strip after being kicked out of Christian Audigier for talking on his cell phone. Yes he was escorted out of the club for talking on his cell phone. \n\nThe Bouncer told him, \""We didn't let you in here to talk on your phone, we let you in here to drink.\"" Apparently, the bouncer didn't have enough brain cells to understand a patron who is drunk has most likely imbibed in a few alcoholic beverages. \n\nI understand these clubs are trying to make money, however from a business person's perspective there's also something to be said about meeting and/or exceeding your patrons' expectations. Christian Audigier never delivered any semblance of a \""hot\"" Vegas nightlife spot to warrant such a pretentious name.\n\nTwo stars for the lively music.\nNeverthless, I would not recommend Christian Audigier."
0,"We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I sent it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.\n\nOh, I should add that we went to the one by the Target near uptown."
1,"Now this place is awesome, Great atmosphere! I feel like I am in a real Ramen house with all the hustle and bustle being around the small yet very effective kitchen. I got the Miso ramen and ordered a hard boiled egg. The broth was amazing, well seasoned and was not overpowering. The Ramen itself was cooked perfect and the chasu was melt in your mouth! The egg was like the icing on top. All the flavors came together in perfect harmony and was such a treat to eat. I have eaten here multiple times and is a place that I highly recommend! If you have family coming into town, this is definitely a place that you should bring them to. If you are coming to Vegas then this is also a place you should go and try, it is off the beaten path but it is worth it. Great place and will be back time and time again."
0,"I was hoping for a better experience.  Beer list is slight above average for \""neighborhood\"" bars in Las Vegas.  Food is average:  I've had chicken wings, french toast, and chicken fried steak.  Bartenders were great, wait staff wasn't too friendly.  I might be back for a beer.  Maybe."
0,"First time having poutine here and it was only ok.  Even for a first-timer, I noticed how the fries were soggy and cooked in old oil.  The gravy barely had flavor and it's listed as BBQ sauce when it's just chicken gravy.  Maybe it's a Quebecois thing.  $8 so not really a bargain and the plate's not even that big.\n\nThe older woman with short hair was bitchy.  Asked her about the Banquise burger to make sure it's with meat and she gave a smart reply of  \""It's a burger, of course there's meat.\""  Really?  Don't they have veggie burgers?  Besides, on the menu, it only lists vegetables under it, whereas other burgers clearly stated it's a double meat patty, blah blah blah.\n\nI don't think I'd return here.  Frite Alors was SOOOOOOOOOO much better in all areas."
0,"Don't order the subs.\n\nI'm so disappointed. I went in to order a sub. I asked for ham and provolone. No provolone. Ever. What Italian place doesn't have provolone? The girl at the counter never asked me what I wanted on my sub so I asked what it comes with. Lettuce, tomato, onion, and Italian vinaigrette.  That sounded fine, although I wasn't used to not being able to choose my own toppings including what type of cheese I want. The sub was disappointing. It was mostly bread (which was good), only 2 slices of ham, one slice of cheese, chunky tomatoes (fresh) and this Cheap Italian dressing. The thick yellow kind. Disgusting. I was so disappointed. I didn't even finish the sub. All I could taste was bread and cheap Italian dressing. I want to support our local business owners, but there's high end pizza chains in the area that deliver a higher quality product with the ability to customize. I won't be going back."
1,V good food I am vegetarian they cook v good veggie food i go there almost every  week I love Thai food is family own Resturent that r so good people good service red curry is my favorite
0,"I was there on Saturday night and it was pretty busy.  The food was fine, the service was not.  Our food came out but had to wait for napkins, however she only brought 2, and we had a party of 4 including 2 small children.  Zero drink refills, we left thirsty and unhappy.  We would have ordered more fries but we never got a chance since the waitress was hardly around.  I know she was busy but there were several employees milling about that could have picked up some slack."
0,Food was okay. Small portions and pricey.
1,"A pretty darn good brunch buffet for a really good price.  I'm usually not a big fan of eating at buffets in vegas but since we were leaving, why not be a fatass.\n\nMust eat:\nPrime rib\nOmelette with bacon and sausage\nMac and cheese\nand the WHOLE desert station."
0,"We have been there many times in the past, however last nites experience was certainly not what we expected.   \n\n1.  We waited almost 30 minutes for our pizza order to be taken as the priority was to fill \""take out\"" orders before helping all the customers in line.  We noticed customers leave due to the long delay.\n2.  Forget to make our salad and had to wait while it was requested to be made again.\n3.  Pizza was burnt around the edges (more than normally) and soggy in the middle, even though it is the same pizza we have ordered in the past.\n4.  Noticed at least 2 individuals returning their pizza for the same reasons\n5.  The manager was busy talking with a couple for at least 15 minutes without providing assistance needed to take orders and process pizzas.\n6.  Tables did not seem to be cleared off in a timely manner.\n\nAgain, we have been there at least 6 times prior and never encountered these problems.  It may have been a one off, however the couple sitting next to us indicated they would not return as it was their first experience.\n\nWe will try it once again and should we encounter similar issues, it will be our last."
0,"I must say... Arby's is one if the only \""fast food\"" joints I go to and my favorite. I live within two blocks. HOWEVER. EVERY time I've been to this location, it's the WORST Arby's experience ever. I get the sand thing every time. Ultimate blt market fresh meal with curly fries and tea. Seems easy, right? Not so easy. Every time I've come here (again it's within one minute) I'm disappointed. Either tiny bacon bits instead of bacon strips, minimal bacon, or tonight !!!!! They had the nerve to serve my market fresh blt sandwich on a regular bun with roast beef. Roast beef!!!! I understand it was probably a new girl, but come on!!!! I didn't even eat it. My boyfriends onion rings were so hard they were worse than a Funyun, but not as tasty. I guess I may have to drive next door to jack in the box instead and risk the gut rot the next day. I believe it will be worth it."
1,"I LOVE Town Square!  There has never been a trip to Vegas without a visit here.  The BEST H&M hands down I've ever been to--better than the 3 story  club-like monster H&M at Caesars everyone loves so much.  You can't even hear your own thoughts there.  Town Squares so much better, and easy to get in and out.\nAlso my fave Sephora because the girls are so friendly....\nFrancesca's isn't as crowded and jammed in either so theres more space to actually breath and shop, sometimes I have panic-attacks in the other Francesca's.\n\nPlus Town Square is super clean and pretty so it's a much better experience than the crazy-town casino malls:)"
1,"Little strange at first, but I have to admit service was great and I was very happy with the way my vehicle performed afterward. A little pressure for extras but overall happy with the experience."
1,We thought this place was great. They had really great omelets and the coffee was strong! There was a wait but it was worth it. The service was great. I had changed my order to substitue the eggs with egg whites and the waitress gave me NO attitude! Really a great little breakfast spot that we just happened to pass by while in Scottsdale!
0,This place cost me $35 for two small sized margarita's (came with the collectable plastic glass). The margarita's were watered down and gave me a headache from all the sugar & salt in them. Out of all the margarita's I have downed in the last few years this was the worst.
0,"Apparently some years ago, a number of people assembled on the steps of a funeral home in the shape of a Christmas Tree and started singing. They are still doing so. Perhaps not the same people, but you get the idea.\n\nWhatever the case, the Singing Christmas Tree is a tradition that is still going strong. Or strongish. There was even a wedding party that has apparently attended the event for 50 years now. But the jury is certainly out on the event itself.\n\nNot having attended this particular performance before, I don't know if this is what they usually do, but they seem to have an identity issue. Notably, some songs are performed in their entirety (and then some), with every verse from the traditional hymnal, with more thrown in as well. Others are abbreviated in American Idol or Glee-esque fashion. It's a mish-mash that doesn't really work that well.\n\nThen throw in works like a tribal drum  number (that was one of the better of the night) and the fact that some of the better voices are muted in the tree itself so you can't hear them, and it's definitely something you might not miss if it doesn't see a 59th  year.\n\nAt a minimum, they may be better off doing a traditional show for those who want the regular hymns, and a contemporary one for those who, well, don't, rather than trying to mix the two. And for goodness sake, fix the sound and seating issues, as those are just too basic to not have working correctly!"
1,"Great customer service. You're in and out in a flash. Those guys know what they're doing! Adam's real nice, we've been going there for years and he always remembers who we are.\n\nPretty convenient if you're running errands. There's the 99cents store, Wal-mart, Starbucks, chase, b of a, restaurants and more all within the same area."
0,"Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. It is bad even for fast food. If you must eat here stick with their Mexican options, because everything else is gross. Even still I always prefer Taco Bell and I am not crazy about that either."
0,"I was going to give them two stars instead of one because it's not their fault I don't eat pork, and for all I know the pork is inexplicably to die for despite the many shortcomings of their other offerings. My dining partner assures me not, so a sad, single, solitary star it is. It was such a crap experience all around that I made notes upon exiting the restaurant so I would be sure to adequately warn people away from this place.\n\nWe went at a weird time, around 2:30 in the afternoon, but if you're going to be open, you don't get to act put upon when someone comes in. There were three other occupied tables. Every single employee, from the hostess to the servers, had \""I don't want to be here\"" written all over their faces. The salad bar/hot food buffet was good, but we'd barely had a chance to dig in when the hostess came over and told us that if we wanted anything else from there we'd have to get it NOW, because they were switching over to dinner service. That seems like the kind of thing you'd tell a customer when they first walk in the door, especially a customer who informed you, when you asked, that she'd never been to your restaurant before. \n\nI ordered iced tea. It was warm, over a small amount of ice. The hostess told me she'd be right back with sweetener, then I never saw her again. The guys who came around with the meat seemed to think it their her job and none of them would bring any.\n\nSpeaking of the meat, it tasted like it was cooked, for far too long by the way, in prepackaged taco seasoning. All of it.\n\nPetty complaint but as long as I'm on a roll, the busser asked for our help clearing the table. Not just \""Would you mind handing me that plate?\"" which is fine with me in a casual environment, but \""Would you stack that on top of that and hand me that? Thanks. Now the silverware...\""\n\nSo after the aborted salad bar and the crappy, dried out meat and the surley waitstaff and the plate stacking (not to mention the pointlessly loud music), we asked for our check and waited - I timed it - 10 minutes. In a restaurant that now had only three occupied tables. Once our bill was retrieved, we waited another five minutes to get our receipt back. \n\nI'm not a jerk, at least I don't think I am, so I don't punish bad service by withholding tips, but this is one of the very rare times that I wanted to. Instead I left my minimum 20%, made a mental note to never eat there again, and jotted down the aforementioned notes. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're considering eating at Brazilian Bull, save your time and money. Go to the grocery store, buy a packet of chalky taco seasoning, apply it liberally to an inexpensive cut of beef or chicken, then stick it in the oven on too high a temperature for too many minutes."
0,"I'll start with the good.  Their coleslaw is fantastic, crisp and sweet and light with little bits of broccoli in it.  \nNow for the rest.  I went with two friends and my two children, one of which uses a high chair.  We walked in on a Monday afternoon and the place was about half full.  A waitress motioned from the back for us to sit at a round table so we did, picking up our own menus on the way.  And then we sat.  And sat.  My son squirmed around on my lap but I had nowhere to put him.  I watched two different waitresses walk by us repeatedly, even cleaning tables but not making eye contact. I finally flagged one down and she came over and said, \""You've been helped right?\""  We said no and she turned around and left.  A few minutes later a different waitress comes up, tells us we want coffee and seems put out when we ask for something else and sighs when I say I need a high chair.  5 more minutes go by and we get half the drinks.  Then a few minutes later the rest.  I can put up with lackluster service as long as the food is good and I had heard great things about this place so I held on to my patience.  I ordered the Long John with mushrooms.  Well, I can tell you that if I ever run out of hockey pucks for my local team, I know where to go.  It was almost inedible.  Dry, tough overcooked ground beef patty with a smattering of tasteless mushrooms topped with half melted cheese.  I actually asked for a side of ranch so I could dip it in that to make it moist enough to eat.  The waitress never asked how the food was, and we never saw her again after she ran my credit card.  \nI hope that this was just an off day but really the second star is only because of the coleslaw.  I will probably try it again if someone else wants to go, but overall not a winner in my book."
1,"Excellent food and service. We had an amazing meal and will go back. I had the veggie patch crape which was filled with great zucchini, mushrooms, and onions. It was amazing!!!  I highly recommend eating here. I would suggest going during the week because they are packed on the weekend."
0,"Worst experience at a \""high end\""  Vegas Buffet ever.  We have been going to Spice Market since the Aladdin Casno and have had good and great experiences but never a bad one.  Have been to other buffets as well but never the Wynn.  We decided to try it out given the good reviews.  \n\nWe arrived and it was busy but the line moved at a reasonable speed. After trying to call multiple times we thought the cost would be the $25 for lunch as listed on many sites but discovered they consider Jan 2nd a holiday and jacked up the price to $40 for \""Brunch\"" and $60 for dinner.  After waiting in line for an hour brunch was 30 min from ending and the dinner transition so we thought it would be worth it getting dinner items as well.  \n\nAs we feared, Brunch is not a special menu but an excuse to replace unique dishes with simple breakfast foods.  Every station had some cheap version of eggs, sausage, hashbrowns obviously in place of themed items on regular menu.  The Eggs Benedict (with smoked Salmon) looked promising but the muffin was so stale I couldn't cut it, the egg over very hard and the Hollandaise so dried out it was no longer liquid.  Salads were pathetic and wilting and seafood section was dismantled a full 20 minutes before the transition leaving it empty for that period.  Carving station had only old turkey and no prime rib for over a half hour and no server for most of it.  \n\nFinally the dinner entrees were served and look promising but ultimately disappointing.  Snapper, Sea Bass and Salmon all rubbery and flavorless.  Oysters not fresh, grab legs ok but they wouldn't steam them for those of us that prefer them that way.  Asian station was a poor imitation of a panda express with mediocre chicken stir fry and sticky buns filled with what appeared to be butternut squash instead of a pork or other filling.  Pot stickers with no Gyoza sauce, just soy sauce in packets?!  \n\nDessert crepes filled with creamy cheese were tasty and the ice cream was very good but the rest of pastries were mostly perfunctory additions to an otherwise bland station.  \n\nAfter speaking to the manager we left understanding the poor experience. Not the service you would expect from an establishment purported to be \""classy\"".  She explained they can't post signs at the entrance or update the website to reflect the \""many\"" holidays throughout the year when they decide to jack up the prices and drop all pretense of quality.  I offered to provide them with the name of a few capable web masters but alas that would be too great a task for this little operation to take on..."
1,"One of Montreal's few whisky spots, Whisky Caf\u00e9 boasts the city's largest selection of Scottish and Irish whiskies, bourbons, ryes, and a growing number of Japanese whiskies. Their cigar lounge is delightful and their staff are very knowledgeable. So, if you're an avid connoisseur or someone looking to get to know your stuff, it's a nice place to go. Just be ready to dish out a few dollars. \nAlso, it's a nice spot for a date."
1,"This is an amazing place!  Great atmosphere, very clean, beautiful bar, and most importantly, great food!\n\nShoot for the fish tacos; yum!!!\n\nThe only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star was due to the service being quite slow and lackluster. Other than that, GO NOW!"
0,"Came here for a late lunch and had their mussels and fries. It was really tasty, but the service wasn't that good even though it was not busy at all. It's a good location, but given the service, I'd probably look for another place for an afternoon beer."

1,"I have been coming here for years and I've always loved it here. It is by far my favorite place to grab some sushi and hang out with friends and drink. I don't know how long they have had the AYCE, but i know its been awhile now. They never had it a couple years ago. The service is always good when I've been here. My favs are the special d rolls, x-girlfriend rolls, and the bacon wrapped scallops."
1,"I found this place by accident one night when I went to Del Taco across the street and they were out of chicken. With my immense chicken craving I decided to go across the street to Popeye's, where I stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant. \n\nI've been going there pretty consistently for about a year now and it's pretty decent food. Typically when the boy and I go he gets the steak kebab plate and I get the chicken kebab plate. It comes to about $20 and we take it home to eat. \n\nTheir rice is always delicious, the meat is always cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and served with speed. Their fries are perfectly crunchy and the pita....oh the pita. YUM.\n\nThe family that runs the joint are VERY nice. It's a place I'll go back to again and again, and to think...if only Del Taco wasn't out of chicken..."
0,"Pho Kinh do...if not for the name, we probably never would have walked into this place.  After having eaten there, I must say that the name is probably the best part about the restaurant.  I love pho for the soup - I like my broth meaty, rich, textured, and so flavorful that you can burp it up hours afterwards and still taste it.  The soup here tastes like someone cracked open a can of beef broth (the kind that's on sale at the supermarket for 55 cents), heated it up slightly, and then dunked some noodles in there.  The soup was lukewarm, and tasted like msg water.  Ironically, even though the soup was not hot, the beef was already fully cooked (if not overcooked) when it came out - it was chewy and tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.  The summer rolls were cheaper than some of the other places we've tried in vegas, but they weren't anything special - the skin on the ends was hard and uncooked on one of my rolls.  As a side note, their banh mi looked interesting (lots of different combinations, including some with egg!) and might be worth a try.\n\nAs for service...we sat down and were not handed menus.  I eventually ended up grabbing the menus myself after unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waitress.  It also took awhile to order, and the food came fast, but that's probably because they hardly heated up the soup at all.  The one thing I will say is that once we finally got our menus and placed our orders, the waitress was very friendly and had a good attitude.  That being said, I don't really care if I have to serve myself at a pho place as long as the broth is slurpy delicious.  \n\nTo summarize: don't come here to eat the pho soup.  It is not anything dac biet."
0,"This place is full of germs and got me sick. The restaurant is filthy and the manager needs to scrub the place and get a more sanitary system for serving food. I wash my hands before I eat every time, but think about how many dirty hands touch the pizza server handle. This is disgusting, you grab the handle and then go eat pizza with those hands. I wish I thought about this before they got me sick. Do yourself a favor & use a napkin to hold the handle. Better yet, get Papa Johns instead, it's way better."
1,Insane custard. Custom burgers are cool but their specials are better value.  Get the big one.\n\nToo bad this place is closed down.  Owners were cool too.
1,"\u00e9 by Jose Andres\nFebruary 8, 2012 - 8:30PM\n\nGeneral Fine-Dining Disclaimer: Many people do not understand that most (if not all) upscale restaurants do not pile a ton of food on your plate. A diner should appreciate the finest flavors orchestrated into smaller dishes, which is how we received our servings. If you're looking for places that serve up large piles of food and multiple napkins, kindly skip my reviews. \n\nEater.com says that this hidden restaurant is one of the hardest reservations to get. All we did to get them was email the website *exactly* one month in advance and wait. In fact, we waited a week without word but were able to secure a reservation for the requested night. They also explained that they are very busy (as you can imagine) and they are almost always booked solid.\n\nOnce you secure your reservations, you'll get a pair of Golden tickets (just like Willy Wonka) by mail. If you live farther than the East Coast, you probably won't get it in time for the event. But they'll still let you in.\n\nOn the night of dinner, get there at least 15 minutes in advance. Have one of Jose's signature Ultimate Gin and Tonics because it really is the ultimate.\n\nTip: Ask the head chef for permission to take pictures as a courtesy. You will be allowed to but you cannot take video (a shame) or use a flash (also a shame, because it's dim in there). When they begin their choreographed assembly of each disk (and I wonder how often they practice), you'll see that flash photography would interfere with their procedures.\n\nEight seats. Twenty three dishes. Wine supplements were skipped. Nearly all were consumed in two bites.\n\n\nGin & Tonic\nSpanish Clavel\nBeet Jewelry\nCaramelized Pork Rinds\nApple \""Brazo de Gitano\""\nNitro Almond Cup\nCrispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche\nJos\u00e9 Taco\nOlive Sferica Ferran Adria (Spherical Olives!!)\nBocata de \""Calamares\""\nCava Sangria\n\nArtichoke Puree w/ Vanilla\nLobster with Citrus and Jasmine\nChickpea Stew with Ib\u00e9rico Ham\nTurbot with Bone Marrow - GF's favorite dish\nRosemary Wild Mushrooms in Papillote\nSecreto of Ib\u00e9rico Pork with Squid\n\nOrange Pith Pur\u00e9e La Serena\nFlan\nPan Con Chocolate\n\""Arroz Con Leche\""\nFizzy Paper\n25 Second Bizcocho\n\""Air\"" Chocolates\n\nLet's face it - you'll be overwhelmed in no time. How do you keep track of each dish *and* take pictures of each? Not easy.\n\nEach dish is composed with fine detail and precision, and Chef Brett took time to describe each (after they were handed to each guest). He also answered any/all questions from the guests while we ate.\n\nOur favorite dishes were:\n\nFried Bone Marrow - Possibly the greatest flavor I've ever experienced. The GF lost her mind over this also.\n\nFried Chicken Skin w/ Oysters and Caviar - If you love chicken skin,  this will rock your world. Two bites.\n\nAt the end of dinner, you will be assigned a unique diner's number based on the total number of diners to date. You will then be asked to sign a personal note to Jose in a small book that others have done previously.\n\nThe bill came out to $540-something for two including tip. This was the finest display of molecular gastronomy I've ever experienced. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
0,"I am extremely disappointed in the Cox services. We have their internet service (wireless), and it is very poor quality. The internet is slow (no matter what device we use and no matter what room of the house), and occasionally it will stop working for a few minutes and then randomly come back on. After about 8 months of this service, we got a notice from Cox that they were increasing our monthly bill (for the same crappy service). We just switched to Century Link, and it is SO much better. And cheaper! The only way to get better Cox service is to pay even MORE and upgrade to a higher-speed package... unacceptable. We've had bad experiences with Cox when we lived in Georgia as well, so we will never be signing up for Cox services again."
0,"Everything at Fuchsia reminded me of my dream bedroom when I was 11; pick, tacky and frilly. I went there for facial and massage; hoping to find a new local place for regular primping.  The facial was quite good, and I was looking forward to my massage. \n\nSadly, the massage was painful. I complained during and afterwards, and didn't feel the staff responded in an effective manner. Overall it was a poor experience, that I don't intend on repeating.\n\nI would never return; there are too many salons and day spas to consider even trying them again."
0,WOW!!! what a disappointment! \nI was so excited to visit BFS --- i work 6 jobs... double and triple days... so my body really needed this massage.\nCame last night at 11pm to do an hr session. With my schedule 11pm yesterday was the only time that worked best for me.\nI was hoping for a women but a man walked in my semi private room...\neverything started out great...\nhe start on my head... worked his way to my arms... then to my feet and legs...\nI didn't know what to expect so I let him do his job...\nThis is where things started bad... he worked his way up my thighs then his hands slipped under my panties...\nAt first I thought it was a mistake... then he opened up the inner part of my legs and stuck his hand in 2 more times! I closed my legs upset... then he threw the towel back over my legs and went back to my feet.\nHe was rough the whole time! At the end of my massage... he pressed his fingers deep into the top of my spine pressing hard and deep into my bones... so hard and long that I woke up with my back feeling bruised!\nI gave them $40 and they didn't want to give me any change since they were already done counting their money for the day. After my bad experience I didn't want to leave a tip... but everyone was in the front lobby giving me the creepiest looks so I didn't want to complain. It was such an uncomfortable feeling/experience.\nI'll never go back!\nBest Foot Spa! shame on you!

0,"I stayed at the South Point Hotel for an annual convention take always takes place in Vegas.\n\nI have to say, for a hotel that is less than a year-old, the South Point seems to be falling apart. The first night we were there I discovered none of the outlets in the bathroom worked, and the light in our toilet area simply died.\n\nThe towels are tiny and rough (cheap!), and there aren't many of them around. We called the reception to order extra towels, but they never arrived.\n\nThe catering for the convention was AWFUL. At one of the events, the food was so bad, and it smelled so awful in the room that my husband and I felt sick and left.\n\nThe air conditioning works well. Maybe too well, because there aren't many blankets around, and even though we adjusted the temperature, it was still freezing in the room. The pillow (yes, singular) was way too tall for us, and I couldn't decide if it was worse with or without it. The mattress was really hard, and my husband and I were really uncomfortable all night.\n\nAlso, because of the air conditioning and the freaking desert outside, my husband and I inquired about renting a humidifier for 3 nights. Guess what? They don't have humidifiers available. IT'S THE DESERT! Get a freaking clue!\n\nAlso, after 6PM, they ask you to present your room key in order to go up to your hotel room. My husband didn't have his on him, and so he had to present proof of ID to come back to the room. I felt like a criminal, when I should be feeling like a guest.\n\nThe pool is very small, and definitely does not match the size of the hotel. The hot tub, however, is really cool.\n\nThe Garden Buffet was subpar, and the food was edible at best. Also, they only serve Pepsi at the hotel, so that was a minus for me, but it's a point of preference.\n\nOverall I had a terrible experience at the South Point, and since it was announced that next year the convention will be, once again, held there, my husband and I will be skipping it next year."
0,"I have lived in phoenix all my life and seeing as mexican food is one of the main dishes here it goes without saying that i have tried numerous places both good and bad. This unfortunately was a bad one, the flour tortillas and salsa were the best thing of the 2 dishes I tried. The beans though they were creamy and smooth seriously lacked flavor of any kind the rice was also just as bland as disappointing. The chips they serve when you first sit down are ok, but they only serve 1 basket free where 99% of other places will serve you as many as want. this isn't a huge deal but it adds to the experience. All in all it was not the worst mexican food ever it just didnt meet the standard that has been set by the south phoneix classics which are Carolina's, Poncho's, and Rito's."
1,"Wow, we just came here just in time on the day before Labor Day.  Only tour is at 1PM which was nice to plan ahead on our 4-hr drive from St. Paul/Minneapolis area.  The tour costs $3 for adults and $2 for children/students.  The tour is approximately 1 hour and we had a great tour with our docent, Jane.  She normally does the tour in the winter time but apparently summer time most volunteers opt out.  To our fortunate accident, Jane gave a wonderful tour of the different floors as well as outside facing the State Capitol.  We finally realized how FLW imagined how his hometown's convention center should look and feel.  I can't believe he did this for only $250 out of a labor of love.  Jane took the time to answer all questions as well as share photos and old carpeting so we knew how things used to look before some renovations.  There was a wedding banquet and almost wished we lived closer to even dream of this place.  Get here early since it looks like summer tours fill up.  There were 18 total but didn't seem to mind that we had a slightly larger crowd.  The gift shop was a bit pricey and didn't seem to find anything to our liking.  Afterwards you can walk towards the State Capitol on MLK and take a free tour."
0,"This review is on their customer service, specifically towards concierge and security-lost and found.\n\nI had left my ipad charger and realized it shortly after I checked out.\nI went back to the hotel and the concierge had confirmed with me that housekeeping retrieved it but it will take couple hours to get it to lost and found.\nI had to leave Vegas so she took down my number and told me security will contact me and it will be mailed to me, free of charge.\n\nAfter not hearing back from them for a week, I called and now the security tells me nothing was retrieved from the room. but I was specifically told that it had been before. He told me a person will be contacting me to start an inquiry/investigation on it on that day.\n\nOf course not to my surprise, I dont hear from them so I call back again 3 days later and now the lady in security is telling me she does not know of such procedure of starting investigation and maybe i should try calling back to speak to that guy again....\n\nplease get your act together Aria in your service area. \nIts not about the charger. it's about being told one thing and then another the next. and then no follow up. and it's a shame because your rooms and casinos are nice. especially for the price."
0,"I'm seldom in the East Valley. That said, I needed to drop someone at the airport in Mesa. I figured since I was in Mesa I would meet with some of my readers to sign some books. I couldn't find the coffee house I initially intended to sign at, even with a Mapquest map. Instead I came across this establishment. \n\nBeing an author, I spend quite a bit of time in quite a few coffee shops around the valley. My default brew at any new new place I try is the Americano bold roast.\n\nWithout exaggeration, Bold Roost is one of the more obnoxious coffee houses I've ever been to (including Starbucks, which I detest). First, the Americano was luke warm, overly bitter (even with 3 sugars and cream), and tasted as if it was made with tap water. Second, the service was absent, the two young women were more interested in talking to each other than following up. Lastly and most importantly (to me), the MUSIC was obnoxiously loud and poorly selected. When I arrived I was greeted with club music - pounding bass with screaming or chanting. Since I needed to stay a while I ended up listening to reggae. I can appreciate almost any genre of music for an hour or two. But the bass and chanting and the consistently loud, inescapable volume of the \""music\"" was too obnoxious to allow me to concentrate on writing. If I wasn't meeting people I would have left after ten minutes.\n\nI'm sticking it out until my readers get here. After that I hope never to see this place again. Not recommended."

1,Absinthe is the best show of all time for the non republicans. Lol..... It is so inn appropriate but freaking hilarious. I could not stop laughing. Very pricy if you are not local but is so worth the money. I will definitely go back as much as possible because its that great!!!!!!
0,"hate it\n- crowded\n- unprofessional\n- sent me to collections after i cancelled my membership\n- 2year contract\n- sales people are douchy\n\nserious creep factor because you can switch to a channel on any of the personal tvs on any machine and watch the kids quest area. great if you want to check on your kids, creepy because anyone can look at your children. so the creepy pedophile on the treadmil next to you probably goes to the bathroom to rub one out thinking about all the kids he was watching. ew.\n\ndont. sign. up. here.\n\ngo to 24 hour in summerlin off town center, much better"
1,"Went yesterday with the wife.  Mid afternoon, not crowded, great fast-friendly service.  Large menu selection.   All meat items were great. short ribs, shrimp, maui maui, and teriyaki chicken.  The house teriyaki sauce is very good.  Rice was rice.  Mac salad could be better.  Portion size was large.  Dinning area was very clean, and comfortable.  Clean fresh restroom. We will definitely go there again, often."
1,Got my hubby to go the Three Amigos.  Great Choice!  The service and food was wonderful.  We hardly have leftover when we dine out.  But this time we did. The servings was good.
0,"I was here last week with 3 girls friends. It was a Wednesday night so it was not very busy. We ordered some sushi and drinks. I had the only Chardonnay they offer and the second glass tasted pretty off like it was old.  I had each one of my friends at the table take a small sip and everyone agreed there was something wrong with it. When I told our server she took the wine and said she would bring me a new one and she did.  A few minutes later the \""manager\"" came over and was asking \""who had the wine\"" and he had an attitude about the way he asked. He wanted to let ME know that it was the same wine and nothing was wrong with the first one. I said well it tasted off and instead of apologizing he proceeded to tell me it was the exact same... pretty much trying to make me look stupid.  Definitely wont be back unless its happy hour and I won't be getting any wine. I am giving one star for management. The food and other service would be about 3 stars..."
0,Beautifully laid out store but the staff is very uptight. The prices are very high and in many cases as high as a new item. To be the only consignment store in Scottsdale to not allow pictures is strange. What are they hiding?
0,"We came in this afternoon for brunch and went straight to the bar, thinking we would only be getting drinks before meeting up with friends. We decided to stay and bring our friends here instead, so I went up to the hostess (short brown hair, jean vest and dress) to put our names down for a seated table. As I walk up to the hostess table, I had to get her attention because she was on her phone. Hostess 101, your phone shouldn't even be near you, you're getting paid to greet customers who come in. As soon as I got her attention I told her that I would like to place my name down for a table. Instead of asking what my name was and how many people were in my party, she said, no because your party has to all be here. Her tone was especially rude as there are other ways of saying no without sounding obnoxious.  The food was mediocre at best and took over half an hour to be served."
1,"Some of the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Everything was really fresh and light which sushi should be, but this just seemed better. Hard to find a soft shell crab roll that the tempura is done well. This place does."
0,"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for some beer and food.  Great beer selection for sure.  The pricing is confusing though if you're ordering flights because some of the individual tasters are 1/3 of the full glass price and some are 1/2 the price.  We neglected to ask what the cost was for each individual tasters before ordering the flights and so when the bill came we were a bit taken back by the high cost.  Had I known some of the 5oz tasters cost more than $5 I would have just ordered a glass of something.  I think they should list the sample sized cost for each of the beers on the menu, that would have helped us make a better choice instead of leaving the place with a feeling of never wanting to return.  However, the food was ridiculously bad.  The caesar salad looked like someone just opened a prepackaged bag from the store and carelessly dumped it into a bowl while the flatbread pizza looked and tasted like something less desirable than a frozen Tombstone pizza. For the cost my expectations were a bit more high.  The service was really good and attentive though."

0,"This is a BREASTaurant    - Hooters with a mountain theme.  I already know this will be a sausage (venison?) fest with exclusively miserable husbands at the bar escaping with sports.\n\nOk this is where they started and went downhill from there.  1 - no gaming - good luck in Vegas franchise from Texas!  2 - young pups (hired for hair and implants and are exactly 21) who don't know how to pour a Manhattan or hold a crowd (lots if standing around and pouting).  3- supposed to be sexy but exactly one skinny body type - no bum no body diversity.  4.  Food sucked and was $$!   Beer slushies and wings on par with Denny's - yum yum. \n\nThis place has been 4 different concepts and this will die out soon too.  There is nothing at all interesting with food, beer, or girls.  The girls are sweet but this is a hot mess of trying to be sexy when we see more on billboards here!  Alienating 50 percent of the population with SIT2P bathrooms and terrible service to females as evidenced by many Yelp reviews in other cities -- not smart! \n\nOk I got accused of being jealous by a fellow Yelper.  Not true- there are lots of places with sexy gals that I love (PT's Gold, Treasures ;) but you also need to be a good bartender!  If you don't know where Firestone beer is from or where you get the venison in the chili from you are just eye candy.  There is nothing wrong with being sexy but if this is a dining spot and not a strip club then act like it!!  Food and service was worse than Hooters - I didn't know that was possible.  You don't really come to a place like this for anything but the girls. Unimpressed.  Grapes on a celery.  No curves :(\n\nArkansas Times agrees with me.  Epic bad.\n\nThey called it, \""The worst most apathetic swill I've ever eaten.\""  Ha ha ha yep!"
0,Prepare to wait two hours for mediocre cuisine.  Go somewhere else.
0,"Food is good but the portions are small for what you are paying. The only thing you are truly going to be fully satisfied with this place is the service and the ambience. If you are expecting to get hungry after you eat here, think again. You're probably gonna end up spending a fortune over here - just make sure you have at least $5 to head over to Planet Hollywood afterwards so you can get yourself something really filling - Earl of Sandwiches!"
0,"Due to the service, I will NEVER go back. I love Indian food and have been to quite a few places in the valley.  Chennai's food was average... when we actually received what we ordered (dinner service). \n\nPros: \n-Relatively fast turn around following ordering.\n-Food was pretty good, if nothing to write home about.\n\nCons: \n-Servers had no idea what was on the menu. They came back twice to ask if \""that 'chinna' thing\"" was a soup and then seemed to point at the menu at random, asking \""is that it?\"" Channa masala. It's a pretty ubiquitous dish. And I can show it to you on the menu if you hand it to me.\n-Of the 6 dishes we ordered, 2 came accurately, 3 were entirely inaccurate (e.g. chaat when we'd ordered a curry dish), and 1 never showed up at all.  \n-They tried to charge us for dishes we didn't order in addition to those we did.\n-We had to ask the waitress for water 3x before she brought it.\n\n\nIf you're going to go there, go for the lunch buffet. The less you have to interact with the servers, the better."
1,"Best cold subs I know of.  Hot subs better than most, but Capriottis is tough to beat there.  Firehouse Subs has a much nicer dining room, though.  The soda machine is a little odd, but amazing once you figure it out.\n\nTheir variety of hot sauces is beyond amazing, but be very careful.  Some are hot pepper extracts, and are therefore much hotter than the peppers themselves."
1,I had the fish taco bowl.. Delicious! Healthy too... Grilled fish on top of brown rice and cabbage with a mango salsa on top. New favorite spot
0,"Visited today for lunch... there were 7 of us.  The food was just okay.  I had a truffle burger and we all shared side items including French Fries (shoestring fries that are HORRIBLE and cold), a house pickle plate that includes a variety of pickled items (carrots, mushrooms, beets, etc., also YUCK), and were supposed to share a plate of fried pickles which were forgotten and never brought to the table.  Aside from the crappy food, soda is served by the bottle (so be prepared to shell out $3 for each 12 oz bottle you drink).... and the real clincher: on top of the 20% gratuity they automatically added to the bill, they added AN EXTRA 20% SERVICE CHARGE simply for being a party of 6 or more.  Nope, sorry... never again!  Good luck surviving in SLS where the hotel smell alone made me want to vomit!"
1,"I love this place! the food is amazing and everything is just delicious! the wait is a bit long, but its worth the wait."
0,"I never thought I would review a place and award it 1 star, but Fresh Choice deserves it.  I went into this local food store last year to buy some fruit as their selection of fruit and veg outside their store looked tempting and mouth watering.  How wrong I was.  I bought blueberries and Granny Smith apples, and although they were both well priced, they were off and rotten inside when I ate them - such a waste of money.  \n\nIt was only recently that I discovered that Fresh Choice had been fined \u00a3300 in January 2009 for selling food that was past its use by date.  If you do go to this shop check the sell by date on thier fresh produce or perhaps stick to their dried and canned foods which can't really go off.   \n\nPerhaps not a Fresh Choice after all."
0,Crooks. Do not buy a vehicle from these people. Once they have your money they no longer care about you or the condition of your vehicle.\n\nThey only have 15 day implied warranties on their vehicles. They rig up their vehicles to break down right after the warranty expires.\n\nI do not see how they have stayed in business for so many years.\n\nAgain do not buy a car from them because you will be sorry.\n\n.
1,I am a huge fan of Re Salon & Med Spa! \n\nEveryone that works at the salon is amazing - all the special attention you receive definitely makes for a great experience. I have been going to the salon for 6 months now and have had multiple visits - everything from cut & color to mani/pedi. \n\nIf you are looking for someone who is magic with color & cut you have to see Bethany - she is definitely one of the best!
0,"I hate to give this place a 1 star.. for the effort of staying open 24hrs, it atleast deserves 2 stars. But the service there is so horrible... I seriously could not do it. I witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that could've gotten it into some major trouble if I wanted to complain about it. So instead of going straight to the health district, Im just going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future. \n\nThe other night at 4AM, I went to eat there with my boyfriend. We were around the area and decided to eat Korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20% off everything on the menu until 8AM. On first impression walking in, the place seemed clean and spacious with about three booths occupied at that time. The place itself is rather larger than most Korean restaurants, had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60+ people. It was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends. But, that was about it on the plus side of our experience.\n\nThe only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us. She was unfriendly, did not speak understandable English and looked as if she was pissed off because we had walked in and now she had more work to do. She sat us down at the table and I saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons. She didn't get us water or anything right away. I know most places, that's considered bad service, but I wasn't that picky to fuss about it at that time.The menu itself was similar to most Korean places. It had tofu soup, bbq and combination plates. Nothing too out of the ordinary, however, the price was about $5 more expensive than most places like Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. We got the combo with seafood tofu soup and Korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for $2. She did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes. When we ordered the soup, she didn't ask us about our preferred spice levels and didn't even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered. All she did was write it down, said nothing looking away, and walked off leaving us kind of dumbfounded. \n\nThe side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people. I understood we only ordered 1 thing, but it was a combination that is close to $16 with $2 extra for rice. She didn't care to accommodate the platings for the party at all, even when it was complimentary.  The soup itself came out boiling, but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot. No one bothered to wipe it off. It wasn't like there was a small amount, you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side. The soup itself tasted good, however. I enjoyed the taste greatly, but to be honest, it was the same as every other Korean resturaunt. Nothing that left a big difference. I noticed for the price they charged, our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very, very tiny.  When our ribs came out at last (the combo pretty much came out one at a time), there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry. What do you know, it was. The ribs itself was not marinated well enough, there was that sesame oil taste, and slightly sweet.. but that was pretty much it for the ribs. I did not enjoy the ribs at all. \n\nThere was 2 people sitting next to us drinking the whole night we were there. On many occasions, I noticed the waitress came over and talk to them, and kept on standing there talking to them in Korean. She payed every attention to that table, and pretty much left us in a corner the whole night. She never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from us. It was dirty the whole night we were there. She even watched TV and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table. \n\nOKAY so are you ready for this? One of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food. He took out a cigarette and lit it up, smoking in front of our waitress. She did nothing, and continued talking to him in Korean. The other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant, with us eating a booth away from them. My boyfriend and I were speechless. They ignored us and kept smoking. At one point, one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand, walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway. I could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being. If that was being allowed in the main lobby area, I wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods. I've gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let us use \""cups\"" as ash trays. But that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this. It's like management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory. I could not believe it. This place is so corrupted."
1,"Great food and great service. Unique flavors and great prices for the quality. Shogun Wagyu burger w foie gras is excellent (I'd leave off the unagi IMO) and Bahn Mi burger w beef,pork,shrimp is great as well. Peking duck buns are awesome and any of the French fries as well. Red sake sangria amazing & the Japanese white ale, hintachi or something like that was a really good beer. \n\nThe bad: we went late, 1am,and they were cleaning. The smell of bleach almost made us leave but we stayed and it disappeared eventually. Bleach the floors when the customers are gone and the sign says closed. \n\nAwesome place!"
1,How can you go wrong here?! The food is always greats quality. I can make a meal out if the Jalapeno Humus and the Fruit & Cheese plate. Good Happy Hour to sit out on the patio under the misters.  Probably my favorite local business in the Valley
0,"I can't.  I just can't.  This place will not be around for long if the owner does not figure out the true meaning behind a local restaurant.  I don't write very many 1-star reviews unless my experience was truly horrible (see for yourself by checking out my stats).  \n\nMy 3 foodie friends and I came here around 6:30 and the place was almost empty.  Bad sign number 1.  \n\nOur waiter started apologizing for their poor paper menu and that it was because they were still testing out dishes...8 weeks after opening their doors.  I get that, I do.  But this wouldn't have been so essential to my dining experience if not for everything else you'll read here.  Bad sign number 2.\n\nOne of my girlfriends ordered the sweet potato fries right off the bat and another got their jalapeno poppers.  As soon as the fries were passed by my face to my friend, I immediately knew they were extremely bad.  They looked beyond done...almost burnt to a crisp.  I can't even believe they were served.  The chef or owner or even the waiter should have stopped them right at the kitchen door.  Sweet potato fries shouldn't be brown.  She did ask for them to be taken back, very politely actually.  Bad sign number 3.\n\nThe vibe of this place is pub-like or almost like a brewery.  Even the menu had a pub type of fare.  Yet, there was a Sriracha Lime Tilapia dish as well as some gourmet sounding bruschetta.  Hmph.  Interesting, weird really.  We ordered our food:  my sweet potato fry friend got her Beer Citrus shrimp, another got the bruschetta and an order of the mixed chips, while my jalapeno popper friend got fish 'n chips and I got their tilapia.  The first two dishes came out fairly quickly.  But my friend immediately said the citrus dip wasn't citrusy at all and my other friend made a face as she told us the bruschetta bread was downright gross.  It was not toasted and had a weird taste...doesn't sound like bruschetta to me.  Her mixed chips weren't mixed and were insanely greasy.  There was actually a pool of grease at the bottom of the basket/bowl.  Bad sign number 4, 5, and 6.  \n\nMy other friend and I continued to wait for our dishes for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.  Suddenly, I felt sick to my stomach (fairly certain it was from the one jalapeno popper) and I don't blame this on the restaurant at all.  TMI, but this is necessary information for bad sign number 100 below.  The waiter brought out a plate of fries and ketchup and told us he wanted us to munch on something while we waited.  He didn't exactly apologize for the wait or anything though.  None of us ate them because we were starting to get grossed out by the food at this point.\n\nOur food finally came out about 20 minutes later.  The cod were very small (for $12) and my tilapia didn't look appetizing at all (for $12 or $14).  Sort of a bad presentation.  But I didn't eat it because I didn't want to tempt fate with my stomach.  So, I asked our waiter if I could have a box...not telling him it was because of an upset stomach, he didn't need to know about that.  He never brought it out...bad sign...I lost count of bad signs by this time.  \n\nTen minutes later, a man silently walked up to our table and proceeded to stand above us and just stare.  My cod friend and I stopped our conversation after about a minute and looked up at him.  He didn't say anything, just stared. So, finally 1 of us inquired why he was there.  He awkwardly asked if we needed anything else in the most condescending and rude way.  I was uncomfortable and felt insanely unwelcome.  I told him I needed a box for my food.  I don't know if he assumed it's because I wasn't happy with my food or what, but he walked away rolling his eyes and scoffing.  Excuse me?!  What in the hell?!  I would have got up and walked out right then and there without paying if I had driven my own car.\n\nIt only got weirder from there.  I continued to watch the owner go to a couple other tables smiling and being somewhat friendly.  What did we exactly do to this guy to make him be so rude to us?  We weren't being rude at all.  But we do know he was aware there was some unhappiness happening at our table.  \n\nThroughout all of this, the waiter hardly ever came over and the manager/owner never really did come over to apologize for the poor service, mistakes made on the food, nothing!  \n\nI am a HUGE supporter of local restaurants and love them to death!  But with poor service like this and poor food, this place should NOT be in business.  I see a lot of reviewers love the beer selection and the owner seems to be very knowledgeable and friendly about those beers.  So, maybe he should open a microbrewery or something along those lines since the whole food part seems to make him unhappy and cranky.  You can't treat customers like this and expect us to return or spread a good word about you.  Customer service is number 1 and they have a TON to improve on.  I will NEVER return!"
1,Place is awesome huge soda selection. Definitely check this place out.
0,"Yuck, just spent $35 for a lousy spinach salad, a side of bread and a glass of wine. The salad dressing was gross. The dressing had separated and was more of a jelly. I will not be back."
1,"After trying out a few other nearby places, I have been most pleased with Maple Cleaners.  First, they do all the cleaning on-site rather than have have your clothes delivered to a warehouse and then brought back in a van the next day. I'm not sure why I like that so much, but I do.  Their prices are fair and they have always done an excellent job with my suits, shirts, jackets, slacks, etc.\n\nThey offer next-day pickup and the staff is friendly.  One time sticks out in particular:  I brought in a suit I needed early the next morning for an important meeting and when I drove up, she saw me and remembered me, grabbed my suit before I even made it to the counter, and wished me luck at the meeting."
0,"I came here to treat a friend for her birthday, I bought the groupon deal.\nWe sat inside because it was too hot to sit in the patio, I ordered the lollipop drink with my groupon which was delicious, amazing presentation, it was a large goblet.\nWe then ordered the appetisers brushetta, and fried mac and cheese pops, the bruschetta , the tomatoes were old, the fried mac and cheese pops , needed to be fried more, When it came to the main course, sadly the chinese chicken salad, looks nothing like the picture on the menu, the lettuce was old, tasted weird, we had call the manager to return the food.\nOn a positve note the drinks were really delicious, the  mai tai a large drink in the goblet and during happy hour, its worth it, but i would not come here for the food, I would only recommend this place for the drinks,\nI would not return to eat here, maybe only for the drink specials."
0,"Nice Mall-scape. \nI like sitting outside near the fireplace on the sofas during the winter and read books.\n\nThe kids go krazy @ the in-ground water fountains, which is pretty annoying sometimes.\n\nNot a huge variety of stores.\n\nI got my wallet stolen at this mall at the food court yard outdoors so *watch your stuff* while you're chilling/ reading.\n\nOh,  a couple toddlers were throwing rocks at trees and hit me, and they started cracking up.\nTheir mothers were too busy talking to even notice. \nDarn those lazy b*tches and their brats! tsk tsk bad parenting.\n\nThe restaurants are meh.\nI like *some* stuff from Rubio's but thats about all."
0,"This is a casino review only.\n\nNot impressed.  Although the casino is beautiful and has a pretty good feel to it, I was continually annoyed with the dealers and cocktail waitresses.  I sat down to a blackjack dealer who looked friendly, then proceeded to pound through hands without a smile or hint of personality.  I switched to a different blackjack table with just about the same result.  I decided to try some caribbean stud and almost walked away before even playing a hand.\n\nMaybe a beer would have made the experience better, but cocktail waitresses were very sparse.  Then, once they finally got around to us, they were grouchy too.\n\nTheir partner casino (The Palazzo) provided a better gaming experience, but worse (barely possible) drink service.\n\nI can't say that my experience with dealers at some of the other stuffier casinos has been that much better, but usually a table change at Bellagio when I get a grumpy dealer gets me there.  For upscale mid-strip gambling, try Paris."
1,"I am a personal assistant and I have a VERY discerning employer with expensive clothes. I have taken Tom Ford, Gucci, Dolce and Gabbana, and vintage clothing to Couture Cleaners for my employer who has never been happier with the results.

1,"The tortas were really good... we've been here before, this time we got a USA and Del Ray.  One torta easily feeds 2 pretty hungry adults.\n\nWe did have one issue - last time we went here I'd ordered a steak quesadilla, and it came with beans on it.  So this time when we ordered a steak quesadilla we explicitly requested no beans on it.  This was for a 'to go' order and the person who took the order over the phone assured us there were no beans on the steak quesadilla but made note of it anyway.\n\nwhen we got home..there were beans on the steak quesadilla.  My daughter and I cannot stand the texture of beans, so that made the steak quesadilla inedible for anyone in my family.  I called to talk to the manager, but it was during dinner rush and he was unable to come to the phone.. so I sent a message via their email contact.  \n\nas I said, fortunately the tortas as easily big enough to feed a few people each, so we split tortas and everyone was full...  \n\nbut why beans on a steak quesadilla?"
0,"I gave this gym two stars because there are really only two good things that I benefit from here. The low monthly fee of $10 (for the first year anyway) and that it's really only 5 minutes away from my house. Other than that...the employees are really Ho hum and not the most welcoming. I don't care if you're only making minimum wage or $100,000 a year, you should always treat your job with a positive attitude and if you don't like it...change or leave. Most of the time I see them gossiping at the desk as if they're picking apart everybody that comes in. Oh...and make sure you don't carry a small gym back pack, even though I was told I could when I signed up, because apparently when you put it in the hooks on the machines that were designed for it... it's a \""tripping hazard\"".  Hmmm... You'll be asked to not bring or carry it.  I'll stay till the first of the year comes around and I can get a good deal from 24 hour fitness. The employees there are always happy."
0,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one."
1,Went for cocktails Saturday night. They have a nice late night crowd with a reverse happy hour. I was impressed with the friendly bartenders. They Kept a tight watch on under age drinking. This place is well managed . I will be back!
0,"This place routinely has the absolute worst service.  The first time my 2 kids and I went there, it took like 45 mins to get served.  THIS IS A MALL PEOPLE! Now tonight, my kids have forgot the pain from the last time, but they said they wanted to eat there again. I overpaid for the kids tenders. While they were waiting for their food, I went to another restaurant and got my food.  I came back to the table where my kids were still waiting. I ate my whole dinner (slowly), while they were STILL waiting. So now as I have nothing to do while waiting for them to finish eating dinner, I'm writing this review. Smh..."
1,"The food here is everything they say it is, but the small place is not very easy to find, even with a GPS! It's to the right of Panda Express right next door to the Burger King on West Elliot, if that helps. You should enjoy this place while it's still swinging for the fences and being run by the friendly man who started it, because it will surely be a multi-location chain in the near future! Unbelievably inexpensive for the high quality product!"
1,"Fast, easy & efficient airport. Small but comes in handy. Overnight parking is easy to get to and low cost in comparisons to airport parking rates.\n\nOnly con is they are limited to just 2 airlines - Allegiant & Spirit. I would use them more if the airlines available here had flights to Los Angeles."
1,"Thank goodness I read the yelp reviews before going out to meet some friends here, or we would have NEVER found it. Ever.  Even with the tip about it being behind a big dirty parking garage, it took us a while, and then, we couldn't find the bloody entrance, not realizing that you had to go through the patio to get in. Ridiculous. Also, there are two 12\"" square signs with the name of the place on it, hidden amongst climbing plants.  I guess they're going for the secret cool spot vibe.\n\nSurprisingly, we (a group of 6) were sat fairly quickly on a Saturday night...it helped that we had a couple of 20-something stereotypically hot girls with us. We were on the patio, which was nice, and had interesting art (giant lit up potato wedges?) up above, but got pretty chilly around 10pm and there were not heaters.\n\nThe waiter?  Snarky, witty, and I loved him. Good service and just enough attitude to make it fun, but not have him be an asshole.  The drink prices? RIDICULOUS.  I shouldn't have to pay more than my meal to get a nice St. Germain drink ($14!) -- and all the drinks were served in pretty small glasses, including my iced tea, of which I needed about 7 million refills.\n\nI did like the plethora of veggie options, and my partner liked the meaty choices. She went with a BBQ sandwich, while I opted for a dinette sized AZ 88 salad and the fries with dipping sauce.\n\nThe salad? HUGE, esp for $5, and delicious.  The fries? Almost as tasty as the dipping sauces.  I didn't like the spicy ketchup, but the remolade and the buffalo blue cheese? To DIE for. Yum! All 6 members of our table gobbled their meals.\n\nThe furniture was interesting...not super comfy, but sit-able.  The women's bathroom? Odd. Really odd.  Mirrors all over, and splashes or urine on the mirrors next to the toilet as if the mirrors had confused someone as to where to actually to pee.  I did, however, LOVE the gender neutral bathroom, and how queer friendly the whole place was.  Versus the rest of Scottsdale, my partner and I actually felt like we fit in.\n\nWhile the drink prices were outrageous, the rest of the stuff wasn't, and we'd totally come back, especially now that we know where it is.  Also, their music selection was excellent!  We found out they had a live DJ spinning, and how amazing is that?"
0,"If I could give this ulta no stars, I would. The African American supervisor/manager at checkout was extremely rude. Was on her headset while I was trying to ask her questions and when I finally got a chance to speak she was unknowledgable and unaware of sales. Everything was out of stock and when I tried to find a nude eyeliner one of the employees took me to one of the most expensive eyeliners. Found one on my own by NYX that was basically the same thing. All in all I wasn't satisfied with my shopping trip. Will be going to Sephora instead"
1,"I have driven by this restaurant everyday for the past several years and never given it a thought.  Last night I tried it and all I can say is wow.  Started off with a Patron margarita, which was very well made.  I had a fish and shrimp taco.  Both tasted extremely fresh.  My wife had the fish diablo, and it was the highlight of the table.  The diablo sauce is fantastic.  Give this restaurant a chance, you will not be disappointed."
0,"Ordererd a panini sandwich. .... terrible , they toasted/ fried the bread on a stale un cleaned grill or so becouse it smell like rotten oil all over my sandwich. No coffe ready when I ask for it, panini was trown into a paper plate it was est\u00e9tically unpleasant to look...."

0,"I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.\n\nFOOD - 4 Stars\nI was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.\n\nAfter a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.\n\nI attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.\n\nOverall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  \n\nSee the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.\n\nWill I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels."
1,"Love it. Massive portions of delicious food, good coffee, great service. Being a Brit, and new to the area, I was surprised to find a Breakfast eatery with a 'Jewish twist'. I used to eat up in Golders Green in London, and this place would fit right in!\n\nI can recommend the chilli omlette, which comes with home fries to! Good Luck walking out without feeling utterly stuffed after that!"
0,"Staff was rude, really unaccommodating to a group of elderly visitors, while I was a caregiver. And they don't split checks, which they told us beforehand when we made the reservation that they did. Food was over priced, and the girl with the nasty ace bandage around her wrist serving food made me want to barf. Will not be returning, ever! This review is overdue, and it was last year that I went, but didn't know the name of the place we ate after the museum."
0,"Cold mugs, and cappuccinos the size of lattes. It's details like that differentiate the good coffee places from the bad ones. and Holley's Cuppa falls into the latter category. \n\nIf you want a legit cup of coffee served right this is not the place to go. \nIf you want a nice place to sit and relax this is also not the place. \n\nPersonally, I had a lot of issues here but, If you like your coffee to be like a sweet treat, and prefer take it to go then Holley's might be worth a try."
0,"I was a fan and frequent customer at Houstons.   After two visits, I am so unimpressed with Hillstone that I won't return.\n\nI will focus on my biggest disappointment.    I used to love their veggies.   They were awesome.    Whatever else I ordered, the veggies were a \""must.\""   One of my favorites was their cauliflower.   It was lightly breaded, crisp, and perfectly seasoned.    Now, the portion is smaller, and the cauliflower is rubbery.    What's fun about that?\n\nI could cite other details, but everything pretty much follows the same theme:  Smaller Portions.   Lesser Quality.    A business model that is pretty hard to understand with the out-of-the-gate popularity of the place."

0,"Arrived on a Monday and walked up to the front only to see yellow \""caution\"" tape across one door. \n\nOn to the front desk where we were greeted at the VIP check-in by a young lady who was obviously still in training. Not sure why someone inexperienced would be working the VIP line. When I made the reservation I asked if it was possible to check-in early. No problem they said, as long as there was a room available. Well, we arrived early asked to check-in and there were no rooms available. However, the couple we were meeting checked-in at the same time and they had a room. Not surprisingly, they found a room for us too.\n\nOn to the room. We were given a room in the Ocean View tower and the elevators made really incredible noises, shook and jerked as we made our way up to our floor. The hotel was built in 1973 and it appears general maintenance and paint have eluded each of the owners through the years. The room was clean enough although there were some minor maintenance issues. The grates on the A/C unit had been moved so that they covered the controls. The strike plate on the bathroom door was loose, so the door stuck each time it was closed. There was a vanity with mirror, but no electrical outlets. When I decided to plug in the phone charger, I noticed there was only one open outlet in the entire room. I tend to walk around in socks while in the room and noticed that the bottoms were picking up dirt from the carpets, even though housekeeping had allegedly vacuumed the room before we checked in. Lastly when I decided to get ice, there was no ice bucket. Housekeeping delivered a plastic beer bucket for me to use, which meant repeated trips to the ice machine.\n\nThe service was okay. Generally the staff was friendly, but appeared overwhelmed. The valet was also the bell desk clerk, which meant either your car or luggage would be delayed at any given time. They also weren't sure that our room was occupied. At 4:30 in the morning I was awakened by pounding at the door. When I got up they announced themselves as \""housekeeping\"" and wanted to know why I was in an unoccupied room. Shortly afterwards an alarm began sounding from the service elevator. I assume it went out because staff was using the guest elevators to reach floors. \n\nAt check-out I was presented a bill and told that my credit card was not charged enough for the \""room hold\"" and that they would have to add another $25. I had to argue that I had not charged anything to the room. I finally left with a zero balance due.\n\nIt's obvious that the property is in bankruptcy and running on a shoestring. take advantage of the cheap room rates, but be aware that this is one instance where you will definitely get what you pay for."
1,"I love this place. It's great for a quick meal if you're shopping or if you work in the area and are on lunch break. \n\nI HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend the Chopped Turkey salad. I get it a couple times a week and with very good reason:\n\nPerfectly portioned and well-priced, it's filled with chopped turkey, Vermont Cheddar, hard-boiled eggs, crispy lettuce, cherry tomatoes and corn. I prefer it with the Cowboy Ranch dressing, but there's also a vinaigrette option. All that for just under $6!\n\nI've gotten the sliders a couple times - they are delish and sized just right for what they are. I know if I am craving a big juicy burger, I can go hit up Johnny Rocket's in the mall, or better yet Five Guys when it opens!\n\nThis was a great concept and it's very nice that it's not trying to be something it's not. Take-out is obviously what the aim is here, as seating is limited."
1,"I got a great cut from Matt and, seriously, the best shampoo job I've ever had. That guy gave me an awesome head massage for like 10 minutes. Amazing. \nThe salon is super hip and they are setting up a little resale shop for designer clothes in the back.\n$50 for just a cut this time, but I'll be back for color."
1,"Awesome organic, natural products! They have a great variety of products considering the store isn't that large. I appreciate the use of local produce, etc. It's all a bit expensive, but that's to be expected."
0,"This place must be under new ownership or something, because the quality of the experience I had has gone down drastically. \n\nThe first time I'd been to The G Spot was about a year ago. The place had a ton of people in it, pretty decent music, and decent service. \n\nI decided to make another trip to The G Spot about a week ago and give it another try. \n\nWhen we walked in (me and my boyfriend), it was almost silent, and the staff was sitting at the back of the place smoking hookah. Not a big deal, whatever. When we went to the counter, the kid who was working walked up to the counter to help us. We were waiting on two other friends to join us, so we wanted to wait to decide what flavor we wanted, but the kid asked us about three times if we wanted to order without them. No. I'm pretty sure I made myself clear the first time, thanks. So we just stood there and waited, and he resumed his smoking with his other friends/coworkers. \n\nThen, when the rest of our party came, he got back up, obviously annoyed that we made him get up twice, and took our order. \n\nWe went and took a seat in one of their couch/booth areas, and waited for the hookah. When it was brought out by the same kid, it only came with one coal. Really. One coal? I'm pretty sure that it's normal to get two coals with your hookah, like every other place does. But we ignored it and smoked it. Once our coal ran out, we had to shout at the kid to get his attention so we could get another coal. He shouted back from the other side of the room \""ONE DOLLAR.\"" meaning that in order for us to get another coal, we'd need to pay a dollar more. Not trying to sound cheap or anything, but why on Earth would you charge a dollar for something that should have been included in the original price of the hookah? Whatever. He brought the coal, and then proceeded back to his area. \n\nThen, we ordered a refill, and he brought the hookah back, and had even more of an attitude that he did in the first place. Really. For being one of the only two parties that were in the room, it's probably not necessary to be an asshole..  \n\nThe hookahs are moderately priced. $15 per hookah (suitable for 4 people), and $6 per refill. But don't be prepared to pay the prices they advertise. You have to pay $1 per extra coal, $1 extra if you want to pay with a card (ridiculous), and extra money for the \""hookah condom\"" things that you get (you're only given one per hookah). \n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning. This place has become a joke"
1,"The Miracle Mile is a decent mall for the average person.  As opposed to going to Caesar Place's Shops and feeling too poor to walk into any of the stores, this mall has stores you can actually afford!  \n\nThe best part is the \""thunderstorm\"" that happens in one area about every hour.  Another one of the best FREE attractions in Vegas, be sure to watch the storm as the \""sky\"" of the mall darkens, thunder rolls in, and it \""rains\"" over the ponds in the middle of the mall."
0,"This is probably one of the most disappointing h&m locations I've visited... Located in the Miracle Mile Shops of Planet Hollywood, it is about the same size as most small-town mall venues. The pictures posted for this location are inaccurate, and are of the 3 story location inside Caesar's Palace Forum Shops.\n\nThis location has a dingy cramped feel. The selection is mediocre, and manages well for such a small location. However, this comes at the cost of racks being right against each other and displays haphazardly arranged.\n\nIf you want to shop H&M in Vegas, go to the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace for the 3-story crown jewel; they have a better selection, more featured and new items, and more items on sale/clearance."
0,"I visited yesterday to look for a storage unit. The sign outside indicates a number of sizes available and rates. I walked in and asked for a rate sheet. The girl at the front desk stated that she did not have one, but that she would write down the rates of the sizes I was interested in. \n\nMe: \""How significantly different are the 5x7 and the 7x10?\""\n\nHer: \""About 2 feet.\""\n\nWhat?\n\nHere are several options for what I would consider to be appropriate responses:\n\n1. A lot of people get the 5x7, but end up deciding it's too small and upgrade to the 7x10.\n\nor\n\n2. Let's talk about what you plan to store and we can help determine what size is best for you.\n\nor \n\n3. Why don't we go look at them and you can get a feel for what the sizes mean.\n\nI didn't need a math lesson. I can do math. I needed simple common courtesy or even basic customer service. I told her that her answer was rude and started to turn to walk out because if service starts off poor, I am not going to stay. I turned to look at her again, and she had a look of shock on her face. I told her that was basic math, and that I could do math. She continued to look surprised and defended her glib, non-service oriented answer. \n\nPerhaps I should lower my expectations for service. She was working the front desk at a storage unit. She probably didn't go through years of customer service training. I don't know. I just know that when it starts bad, it's going to be bad. I won't be going back and will be checking out other options in the neighborhood."
1,"Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for!\n\nI had the vegetarian prix fixe menu.  Put it this way, I was having food orgasms throughout the whole dinner!  The presentation, the amalgamation of flavors and textures are just insanely surreal.  This chef knows food, and it is truly executed through the dishes.\n\nMy carnivorous friends enjoyed all the meat and seafood dishes.  \n\n\n\nDesserts were scrum-dilly-umptious as well!\n\nAnd if the food wasn't enough, the service is just as stellar.  I swear they had a million servers waiting on you hand and foot.  There was the main gal who took our order, the sommelier, the staff who changed our dishes and silverware, the ones who maintained our beverages.  Not once did we re-pour our glasses of wine, or water.  And check this, an attendant to wipe up in the bathroom after each person who comes in.  \n\nThis is dining to the 9.  The place was beautiful!  Shades of browns from light to dark are the color schemes of the joint.  Textured walls that look  like stones surround the restaurant.  We were seated in a separated area where we were secluded from the restaurant.  The curtains blocked off the main dining area, so it felt like we had our own private room.\n\nI wish I could eat here on a weekly basis!"
0,"I can't believe that I am spending time writing a review about a bank, especially after this one has cost me so much time already!! However, after countless bad experiences with basic transactions, completely inept business bankers on three separate occasions, and an ATM that seems to accept deposits a mere seven days a year, I had to spread the word. This branch, it's tellers (both personal and business), as well as their atm's are far less than acceptable. I live 30 seconds away, yet refuse to go any longer. It's a bank, I'm never going to get ecstatic over one, but I apparently can get livid. Go at your own risk, but make sure you have a plethora or time and patience if you do!"
1,"Delicious food! The concierge at the Ritz Carlton told us about this place. I had the hangar steak and it didn't disappoint! If you want French with generous proportions, you need to try this restaurant."
1,"Went here tonight with three friends for dinner. We were immediately greeted and found a seat next to our friends. Someone came by and got our drink orders right away, and we quickly decided on what we wanted to get. Imagine my delight when I discovered they had a kids' size pho bowl! :) mmmmm\n\nSo anyways, we shared an app of spring rolls which were really good and tasted very fresh. The pho came out shortly after and was equally as good. The owner came by and checked in with us and was very friendly, and our server came by and gave us a few tips on how we could mix the sauces to our liking.\n\nIt's a really nice restaurant in a nice megamart if you will, and I'll definitely be back, especially since it's right down the street."
1,"Stopped by Delmonico's for my birthday, per a recommendation from a friend... and I would not hesitate to come again.  I had the Bone-in Ribeye and it was by far the best steak I've ever head, juicy and tender, and everything you want in a steak.  I ordered some sides but wasn't even necessary, I couldn't even finish the steak!  Service was great.  A little on the pricey side but worth spending the money at least once."
1,"Let them eat cake! \n\nDuring my stay at Caesar's Palace this past weekend I discovered the most amazing patisserie. My sister and I were heading to the Forum Shops and found Payard Patisserie and Bistro. \n\nChocolates, pastries and ice cream oh my! I seriously wanted just about everything in this shop. The pastries were so beautiful...almost too beautiful to consume! Almost. ;) \n\nI purchased a box of chocolates as a gift for someone I know who adores chocolates. Word is they are some of the best chocolates ever. I also selected a package of Madelines which were so plump and fluffy. I even saw little flecks of vanilla bean. So yummy! \n\nOne night after dinner we decided we could all go for a sweet treat. I ordered the coconut sorbet which was the most coconutty, creamy sweetest cold treat I have ever had. I also sampled a bite of my other sister's Raspberry-Rhubarb Napoleon. I'm not a rhubarb fan, but I couldn't even taste it. The pastry was so light and flaky! \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth like me, you'll definitely want to pay a visit to Payard! Bon Appetite!"
0,"I would not refer anyone here!\nFood was decent. Servers were not knowledge about menu. So many little extra charges they do not tell you about! I.e. refills, cheese, egg beaters. Even after speaking with them about the extra fees, the did not waive the extra charges.\nHash browns were disgusting, mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant from a box."
0,"A coworker told me I just had to try this place, and to definitely have their French toast, so we went. After we were told that it would only be around 20 min wait, they finally brought us our food 45 min later. The good news was, their French toast was pretty dang good. Bad news was, it was cold. Must be awesome when it's fresh off the grill. \n\nI figured that maybe it was just an off day and to give The Spot another chance. It's a little hard finding something I can eat off their menu since I don't eat pork, and I finally settled on a burger because there was an option to remove the bacon from my order. It would've been nice to know that they mixed in bacon bits with the hamburger, which I found out halfway through the burger. So now since I've never eaten pork, I have myself some fantastic stomach cramps right now, and I'm thinking that I'm done with this place for good."
1,"I am a new fan of Daily Dose MidTown!\nMy family and I ate there for breakfast, and I went for the Sweet instead of Savory, which is very rare for me, but it turned out to be yummy! I got the PB&J Belgian Waffle. Such a creative dish and so HUGE! The portions here are monstrous, so come here with a big appetite. Others at my table got the prime rib benedict, the breakfast nachos and the berry multigrain pancakes, and all were huge portions. We left full & satisfied.\nOnly withheld a star because there was a 20-minute wait in the hot sun with no chairs or benches to sit on. I feel like this would be an easy accommodation to make guests more comfortable."
0,"Short version: If you can help it, go to another Paradise Bakery.\n\nLong version: Of all the Paradise Bakeries I've been to this one is consistently the worst but it's the closest to home. Had my heart set on a Chicken Walnut Sandwich tonight but the guy said \""we are out of molasses bread\"" and just stared at me. No apologies. Just stood there and looked annoyed at me for picking a sandwich they didn't have the bread for. My bad bro. Admittedly I don't come here for the service but common courtesy would be nice. \n\nWe get catering for our monthly meetings at the one at Biltmore all the time and they seem to be better."
1,"Everything about this place is brilliant. Wouldn't be surprised to see them pop up all over the country, it's that fun (and delicious too). Hope one comes to Dallas, Tx, because I won't be back in NC for a while."
0,I had heard raves about this restaurant so brought 3 guests for dinner.  Food was just ok (the 22 oz  rib eye steak was 50% fat and bones and was undercooked; scallops just ok; frites and vegies barely warm).  Our waitress was very good which compensated a bit for the food.
0,"When I ate there the first time - they served our party wonderful food fair. From the rolls to the fried rice to the pork tonkatsu. Since I had good food and service the first time, I decided to call in an order for pick-up. I ordered a Spicy Tuna roll -\nIt smelled bad ! I could tell they served me rotting fish that had not been in a cold storage.\nThats too bad for them - since down the street from them - less than 5 miles there are several other excellent Japanese sushi places.\nNeedless to say - I will not be back there in a long time."

1,"I was very happy with my sales person and my purchase. They were not high pressure  and the ring and diamond I purchased were a higher quality and better price than other places I had been. \n\nIt doesnt stop there either, the  warranty plan we recieved was FREE and does not require us to bring the ring in at scheduled intervals to keep the warranty valid (Other stores charged for warranty plans and required the item be brought in every 6 months for a cleaning and checkup to keep the warranty valid) . After about 2 years my wife noticed one of the smaller stones had fallen out so I took the ring back and they replaced the stone no questions asked. Also we can take it back at anytime for a cleaning. \n\nI would highly recommend anyone to at least visit Shane Co. when they are looking for any jewlery item."
1,"I have ate at this Pita Jugnle over 100 times. I love it, I loved it when it was a one room order at the counter spot and I love its expanded full blown restaurant. The food is great, my favorites.. Baba ganoush, hummos, lavash schwarma, caribbean salad and the glazed chicken pizza. The herbal (I think passion) ice tea is also great. I read through many of these reviews and I can honestly say I have never had bad service here, I even frequent the place during lunch when it is packed and still have good service."
0,"Well lets see. Hidden away like a crazy uncle in the attic. Inside is very elegant and charming. There's a small area for private parties. Plenty of flat screen TV's for sports. Full bar with super expensive poorly made cocktails. This reminds me of a singles bar, dress-code looks upscale. It doesn't have that \""lets hang out and have a beer\"" feel to it- more like \""Sex in the City lets sip on the Martini\"" kind of vibe. Too fancy for me really, I'm into the bar fights and breaking beer bottles on my bar mates head ;b At least this place is open late on school nights. But thats about all. :)"
1,The food was very good and I server Michael was very engaging. A fun place to have dinner.
0,"While complaining about TSA seems useless, after flying through Las Vegas, it may be cathartic. First, the TSA staff (with the exception of one woman who really tried to be helpful) is unfriendly and uncaring. Second, the TSA staff clearly needs more training. And finally, can someone with even a modicum of expertise in efficiency design consult with the TSA at Las Vegas so that its absurd system can be redesigned?\n\nLet's start with the staff. They seemed to pride themselves on not being helpful. We were in line behind a woman who arrived late for her flight home to Hong Kong (via San Francisco). Her English was limited and she was panicked about not making her connecting flight. Not one TSA person would even attempt to listen to her, let alone help. She showed us her ticket, which showed that her flight had already started to board and that it would depart in about 20 minutes. I pointed this out to the TSA official. Her reply, \""She has to wait in line until her turn, It's her problem if she was late.\"" She then turned and walked away. In other airports, I have seen TSA help people in that situation. I guess not only what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but when you arrive late to the airport, you also stay in Vegas.\n\nNow to the staff. Our screening line moved excruciatingly slowly. In fact, it didn't moved for long stretches. Why? The screener had no idea what he was looking at. He must have routed one of every six bags for further screening. My bag was targeted. Why? They had to separately my battery backup. In the process they lost the strap to my bag, but merely walked away. That was in addition to me standing holding my laptop and being told by another screener to move while he examined another passenger's bag. How I was to reload my bag when it eventually passed its second screening - and after his cohort instructed me not to go anywhere -- was irrelevant. \n\nAnd lastly, to efficiency. Like every TSA line, it's setup like Disney World, with long lines twisting. But then as we got closer to the initial screener, the line was divided into two lines. We all thought \""Great,\"" we'll move a bit more quickly. Silly us. All it did was divide the line until we all alternated before the lone screener. Then, once we survived that stupidity, we were left to meander into the lines where we and our belonging were checked. There certainly weren't enough lines open, and when you added in the wait caused by our zealous screener, I have no doubt that others also missed their flights.\n\nWhile we made our flight, with time to spare, it seems ironic that a city that's entire existence is based on tourism would allow a situation to fester in which tourists final memory was a lasting sneer from TSA."
1,"Sorry, I LOVE 99 Cents Only!\n\nI was so glad when I moved over here from L.A. & found that 99 Cents lives here too.  They have a lot of your everyday groceries, hardware, & much more, at super low prices.  If I need something & I'm not sure if they would have it, they usually DO!  Everything here is just a dollar, too.  This is not a \""Dollar Store\"" where things are $4!\n\nThe \""worst\"" values here are like sale prices at Fry's Food, & the best are just amazing.  I see & buy items here that cost up to $20 elsewhere!\n\nThe only time I get mad is when I see something here for a dollar that I just paid $5 or $10 for somewhere else!  YES, I've had that happen more times than I want to remember.  Meanwhile, I buy about half of my groceries here, as well as most of my sundries, small tools, & so on.  Do you have a land line phone & pay for long distance?  You get 99 minutes here for a dollar, or 25 minutes to Canada or Mexico!     :-))"
1,"I ate at Rounders the other day for the first time and was super impressed!!\nThe bar and gaming area is perfect and comfortable, with great TV's for sports.

Friendly, knowledgeable, and fun, she took great care of us and made our dining experience really special!  She made the perfect recommendations, and everything was served quickly and correctly....thanks again for helping make our evening so enjoyable!\n\nIf you haven't been here yet, try it!

0,"So I went here with a friend after spending a sweltering day apartment hunting in Chandler. I was hot, irritated, and in need of a cold beer and somewhere to hang for awhile. It was late on a Sunday afternoon, and I was parked at Home Depot across the street so I walked there. In other words, my expectations were low already, shouldn't be hard to please me right? Ha...\n\nAs we approached the door, we were greeted by a chalkboard sign showcasing the featured beer of the month. August's beer of the month: Bud Light. Wtf. Already I am rethinking this place, but we're thirsty so we go in.\n\nTeeny tiny shirts and skirts on the waitresses: yeah, not my favorite part of the place. My male friend agreed, but you walk in knowing what you're getting into, so whatever. Skanky, dirty, sticky, food-coated bar during a lull with no customers: also, not so much a fan. Chose a seat and had to move because I didn't want to put my arms down on the counter.\n\nThe encounter with the bartender went roughly as follows:\nMy friend: So, the beer of the month is... Bud Light? Really? \nBartender: Yep, Bud Light. (straight, serious face)\nFriend: Uh, yeah, because clearly Bud Light is the best beer ever.\nBartender: Well, it is the best beer ever. I mean, it's my favorite beer. (still serious face, but now slightly defensive tone for mocking his beer-love.)\nFriend: Right. So I guess I'll just have a Miller Lite then.\n\nIt's not a horrible place, and I'm sure I'll end up back there. I just think documentation is necessary when a bartender says his favorite beer is Bud Light."
0,Typical chain.
0,This place is really not good each time I have come here I have gotten sick the garlic fries had way too much salt on them to the point where I had to stop eating them and I had to throw them away. The burger that I got from here wasn't cooked all the way the meat was all red in the middle like they were rushing it and the bacon was way overcooked then what it needed to be just an overall bad fast food experience at this place and I payed almost $25 for that meal I feel like I got ripped off so do yourself a favor stay away from this place.
1,"This is excellent pizza.  They had a few minor issues with dough and distribution of toppings the first few times I went in, but things seem to be getting a lot better.  Definitely the best pie on State Street at this point.\n\nIt's a nice space and Greg, the guy who runs it, is a very nice guy.  I'll be back."
0,"Just wanted a trim, got a quick perfunctory cut.  Grumpy hairdresser."
1,I would like to give this place a negative review just to keep other people away from it.  It's a hidden gem in Downtown Chandler area.  Went there for breakfast on Sunday and the food was awesome!  The service was outstanding as well.  Definitely sit on the patio.
0,"The coffee is fine, but after hours they play the music so obnoxiously loud and wear the skimpiest clothes.  I feel like I'm going to a frat party I steady if picking up a coffee. Oddly, the location around thunderbird and 101 is nothing like this....  I'm wondering id this location just hired too many teens that don't know the difference between friendly and obnoxious. The atmosphere seems decidedly different during the day. I'd be surprised if Burger King can here their drive-through customers.  Maybe 2200 hours is when they all go crazy and lose sight of the concept if \""at work!\"""
0,"Enjoyed the Pimms but that's where the enjoyment stopped.  The food was bland and service was nothing spectacular. On a later date, I had high tea there. Scones were good but the little sandwiches tasted stale and the salmon in them tasted like it was out of a package."
1,"I've been to the Morton's in the Biltmore area several times and just loved it. Perfect every time. So when the boyfriend's mom wanted a steak dinner for Mother's Day of course our first choice was Morton's. Although we shouldn't have strayed from the Biltmore location.\n\nI'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.\n\nThe reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if \""everything was okay.\"" I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.\n\nThis location also feels much more casual than Biltmore's. I guess I'm old fashioned but when I go out for a steak dinner I get dressed up. Many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.\n\nNext time we're craving a Morton's steak, we'll be heading back to the Biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service, every time."
0,Do not go to this place!!  Owner is a complete asshole!!  Every time we are there he is staring me and my kids down like we're doing something wrong. Today they topped their bad behavior for not letting us bring in food.  I frequent indoor playgrounds weekly and have never been told this. They are so rude. I can not believe they expect kids to just eat snacks. Never comin here again
0,"It was my first time here.  Read the Yelp reviews so I wanted to try it.  First of all, the service was horrible.  No one acknowledged us when we came in; the restaurant was not busy at that time.  After waiting for more than 5 minutes, we had to flag down a waiter for the menu.  After we ordered, I asked for spoons/forks for my children and the waiter told me it's behind me and told me to go get it myself.  I was shocked by that, but got up and got them for my kids.\n\nWe ordered \""Pho Dat Biet.\""  The price and portion was great, but the broth was tasteless.  I have tasted many phos in my lifetime, and never has had one so tasteless before.  We also had, \""Mi xao.  The mi was flavorful, but the vegetables were tasteless and there was not much meat/seafood in there at all (2 shrimps, 2 rings of calamari and about 4 imitation crab pieces).  I have never had one with so little meat before.  In addition, the \""Banh mi thit nguoi\"" was the worst I've had - there was hardly much meat and there was too much pepper - not too flavorful at all.  Furthermore, the \""Com chien tom\"" hardly had any shrimp in it, even though there was plenty of rice.\n\nThe chef must have forgotten to add spices to our food during this day, as my experience seems to be in the minority here. It is definitely not a place I would visit again - even though the price and portion is good, the service and food was awful."
0,"I noticed this place open up around the holidays.  It seemed to be dead whenever I passed it so I wanted to stop by and give them my business.   Plus, they have a %15 off sign up and that sold me getting a mani/pedi.\n\nThe decor is great, everything is clean and there's a beautiful water feature when you walk in.  Picking out nail polish was the best part of the entire experience, lots of wonderful colors and a large variety.  Even though they didn't seem to be busy, I sat and waited for about 15 minutes to be called back - most places will give you a pedi chair right away.  After I was called back I waited a total of 45 minutes soaking in the chair.  At first, I didn't mind because I was really into my book but then two ladies sitting next to me were sick of waiting so they got up and left and it made me aware of the time.  A woman on the other side of me started flipping out because a dead bug was on her foot so I started to get antsy and contemplated leaving.  Then, I realized that my water had gone cold and it was making the rest of me cold so I took that as my cue to leave.  I shoved my cold, wet feet back into my shoes and walked out.  I did get an apology as I was leaving though."
0,"I have heard the saying that pizza is like sex, even the worst you can have is still not bad. Hmmm. Sounds like the person that made this up has the palette of a toddler, and well.. \nIf I was to find a sexual encounter equal to my pizza experience at the saucy tomato, I would probably say it would be the encounter that is so bad it makes you switch sexual orientation. \n\nPizza came in a decent amount of time I suppose, I take the box to my kitchen and open the box to expose a flat sloppy pizza folded over on one side to fit in the box. Sauce was everywhere and I was just in awe. Chicago pizza..is not thin. It looked like the cook had made it from a Chef Boyarde pizza kit. So I called and the girl that answered told me that if I wanted the Chicago style pizza I have to specify that when I order or else it comes the way we received ours. Well actually she said, \""Ummm if you want it, like, the other way, you have to like, ask for it. It comes whatever way you got it then. Wait, did you want it flat and didn't get it or..like the..hold on....(long ass pause)...Hello? wait, wait..what did you order again?\"" \nAfter explaining to her that I had ordered the Chicago style initially and received..something else entirely, she told me that the type of pizza I wanted would take longer, cool whatever! I am always nice and patient when it comes to my food and the people that handle it, I will wait for what I want no problem. They delivered it in about 15 minutes. The delivery guy demanded to see the pizza we did not want. He then told us there was nothing wrong with the pizza and 99% of them all look like that. He was wearing an apron and so I am sure he is the one that made it and does not like criticism. ( How you like me now asshole??) He said the fact that the pizza needed to be folded to fit in the box was like a bonus for us, and the sauce splattered all over the crust and pouring out the sides was also extra lucky for us. He was very aggressive and actually made us nervous this creeper knows where we live. He continued to yell at us about the pizza, us being two women with our very young childrenalso  at the door, also getting frightened. He then left and I was both relieved he was gone and pissed I over tipped him the first tie he was here. We took the pizza to the kitchen, opened the box, and the pizza was not even halfway cooked.The dough was almost fully raw and the cheese wasn't even slightly browned. I put it in the oven, really let the whole situation settle in and decided to NOT eat the pizza, take the $30 loss and eat a bowl of Fruit Loops. \nThe fact that order was messed up, that happens, it is not a big deal. The fact that the girl was totally unqualified to answer phones and take orders, whatever man she is probably 15 and its her first job so she is fine. But the fact that they sent a grown man twice my size to yell in threatening tone at me and my children is so way out of control I wouldn't believe it unless it happened to me. I wanted to call and complain to the store but my friend wouldn't let me as this fucking psycho knows were I live and if he couldn't take criticism for making a pizza badly imagine criticism about personal relations issues. \nThe whole situation gave me an epiphany about delivery. You never know who the fuck is coming to your house until it is too late. After this experience I will NEVER EVER AGAIN order delivery food to my home no matter how tired, hung over, late it may be, I will either drive my tired ass to the store, or once again go for a bowl of Fruit Loops."
0,"my boyfriend and i stayed there last weekend. our first time at this hotel. i thought the room was clean and spacious. the smell in the hall of chemicals from cleaning the carpets lasted the whole weekend. it was not pleasant. i'd suggest water steam cleaning. food was good at the hotel. the smoke was bad. at checkout i had to step outside, felt like i couldn't breathe, and i was only downstairs maybe 15 min tops the night before. and i don't have asthma or a cough. \nthe pool area was nice, but beware of the chemicals. the hot tub wasn't bubbling but we popped in it. the chemical smells again were nasty. you could feel it on your skin. we didn't stay in it. after cleaning ourselves off we were driving home the next day and we still smelled the chemicals on our skin. it ruined my new swimsuit. it still smells like chemicals after 3 washings (one in vinegar to try to rid of the smell). it took a couple days for our skin to return to normal. that is just not healthy. we paid $40 for 'resort fees' for our stay to have that happen?\nstaff was nice. i asked for a blanket one evening (none on the bed) and was told they don't have any. never got one the whole time i was there. luckily had a comforter in the car i dragged up into the room.\ngood deal, yes, but not sure i'd stay there again for these reasons."
1,Nice airport with good dining choices. The US Airways Lounge is great too.
0,"Lively terrasse that can accommodate large groups, loud rock music playing in the back, but not so great selection of beers, or other drinks for that matter. My friends and I came here to start our night off before our little pub crawl along St. Denis, which was fine and that's probably all I'd come here for."
1,"this review is for my $7 big ass cheesecake that i failed to finish. it was darn good though for that price it was worth it. the service though is slow. we didn't get helped for awhile and it took forever to bring us just water. i believe they just created my cheesecake on the go cuz that too, took forever. our server was nice though but it wasn't enough for me to win her cuz of the lack of speed"
0,"Drove around and end up at these place b/c the place sounds good.  Unfortunately, the drinks are super sweet and my beer was stale.  Wouldn't go back."
0,"I was here in the winter of 2012 and it was great.  I just recently visited again a year later and I was not impressed!  Visited on a Friday night and the music was so loud I couldn't even have a conversation.  Sadly, we left because it was over-priced and too noisy.  If I wanted to go to a night club, I would have.  Decided to return the following day for the real reason I wanted to return there in the first place - happy hour.  Stupidly, they got rid of their happy hour due to a change in management.  BIG MISTAKE!  Due to a lack of happy hour, I left for the second time and went somewhere else.  I think this place is over priced and way too loud.  Unless they decide to have a happy hour again, I will no longer recommend this place or return.  Save your money and go to Max Brenner at Caesar's, they have a terrific happy hour and a chocolate themed menu that is delicious!"
1,"The best customer service I have ever received was from this company.  It is always on par. Specifically Lauren Warburton.  She has been helpful, professional, friendly, and everything else a person working in customer service should be.  \n\nThe  units are clean, the price is comparable, access is a little hard, but with the customer service you recieve a little hard access is nothing.  \n\nKudos to this Uncle Bob's and Lauren."
1,"Went for dinner last evening. This is wonderful restaurant. They have been open about 4 week. The service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent, can't beat the prices and most important the food was outstanding!  We drove from Surprise and will definitely go back frequently. Was well worth the 35 mile each way drive. If you fancy Calamari you will be in AWE of this dish. And a very generous serving, shared by 4. I had the Pork Belly tacos for my entree, superb!  Others had shrimp poorboy, and pork roast sandwich. Everyone loved their food. Not one complaint. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."
0,Nice decor inside and out for world wide chain.  Food good not great and higher priced.  Hiromaru better tasting for similar price.  Monta much better bargain.  Music here was so loud could not have conversation.  Who comes to these places to listen to loud 'club' music?  Hard seats need cushions.  Too many better places so would not return.
1,This place was awesome! The portobello burger was so good. I love that they fixed up that area...this is just what it needed.
1,"Breakfast is a meal I never really eat, but when I do... \n\nThe Red Velvet Pancakes with cream cheese frosting-syrup was mouth-watering-ly good and I'm glad we opted for the full stack instead of just a half stack. \n\nI always like to pair something savory with the sweet, so we got the Piglet omellette with seasoned potatoes. \n\nGrades\nPancakes -  A+; it was definitely worth the drive \""across town\""\nPiglet - C-; I don't know what it was, but it wasn't out the ordinary\nSeasoned potatoes - A; I can't pass on potatoes\n\nWe managed to beat the \""lunch rush\"" because as soon as we were seated about 5 other parties showed up and there was a huge line. \n\nAlso, beware of the small tables. The table next to us had their drink spilled on them due to lack of space. It was kinda funny and sad to see."
0,"I have never sent food back in my life, but my Shipwrecked burger I asked for medium came raw. I sent it back and the bartender told me \""Don't you know beef are the cleanest animal.\"" \n\nI know raw ground beef is not safe to eat even though I like my steaks on the raw side. She then said, \""I guess you're one of those people that knows everything.\"" \n\nI'm a judge advocate in the Marine Corps out with my buddy trying to remember the holiday for the right reasons, and we had to put up with this. The burger came back after a half asked re-firing on the same lettuce and bun. It was still raw. \n\nThe beer selection - I had two - was nice, but I left immediately after. With competent service this place would at least be acceptable, but this experience nearly ruined my Memorial Day evening."
0,"I was hoping for a good (drunk) time but nothing. I like many others got the Groupon deal of an open bar for $10 from the regularly priced $20. Even if you don't have a Groupon, Blondies advertises the best happy your in Vegas: All you can drink (beer or well drinks) from 3-6pm or 10pm-1am, excluding game days. Blondies is located inside the always busy Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood. It's a great place to catch a game compared to other pricier places on the Vegas strip.\n\nMe and my lady friend went in on Friday, January 17 and we're expecting a wait but it was pretty dead for 10pm on a Friday night. Blondies has some serious square footage and there's a plethora of sports memorabilia and flat-screens littered throughout the bar and grill. We were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted and we headed towards the back bar. However, we quickly made our way back to the front bar after the bar tender informed us she was closing up.\n\nAfter seating ourselves, a server was quick to tend to us and we let him know we had the open bar deal. He went on to put a bracelet on us and began serving us well drinks. Simple vodka and juice drinks. The first drink was nothing to brag about. I felt like I was drinking expired cranberry juice while my girlfriend drank orange juice. I knew then and there we were not going to get drunk. Five drinks (each) later we were exploding from a big dinner and tons of cranberry and orange juice. Not even a buzz. We decided to call it quits and take our loss. \n\nI think my biggest gripe is the inconsistency in drinks. The bartenders were great guys but one was making us real drinks while the other was serving us juice. Regardless I was nice enough to tip every time. The TV at our bar was playing an old UFC fight and my lady was forced to watch some guy get his head and nose bashed in while we drank our watered down drinks. We could have asked to change the channel, but didn't feel like bothering our bartenders. I'm sure this isn't a bad place by any means but I'll have to dispute their claim as the best happy hour in Vegas. \n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\nFood (Drinks): 1/5\nService: 3/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 2/5\n\nPros:\n+ Full bar\n+ Open 24 hours\n+ Drink specials\n+ Lunch/dinner menu\n+ Cute hostess' and bartenders\n\nCons:\n- Open bar drinks vary in strength"
0,I am only giving two stars because of the actual vet herself. Jade Tenberg was the first vet in four years to spend time talking to us about Gidgets skin condition. That's another story though. We are thankful to her for actually caring about her condition and our talking to us about our options. It is the front desk that is ridiculous and not just one time but every single time I have ever had to call. If you make an appt. I highly recommended calling to confirm what day and time they actually scheduled you for. I would also recommend calling to confirm what they put down for the reason for the visit. So far I have had to correct them almost every single time. The other issue is the check in and check out time. They are sooooo slow and have no idea what they are doing. Bansfield should be embarrassed. As far as the wellness plan it is over priced and a scam. You are better off going to a regular vet not inside of a Petsmart. Today was the final event and I am calling to cancel my plan with them and finding a different vet.
0,"We were looking for a place to eat one night and were just going to randomly choose a place, and then we walked by here and saw that it was jam-packed, line waiting to be seated and so we all looked at one another and walked in thinking: \""Wow, the Pho must be amazing!!\""  and... it was ok, definitely not the worst Pho I've had but it wasn't the best either. I guess I just don' t get it because the Pho back home is so much more rich and flavorful, this just tasted like slightly flavored water to me.\nThe service was ok, and the seating is tight so be prepared to sit next to someone who you don't know.  I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't be a in a hurry to return here."
0,"If you are booking a room because of the price, then let me tell you......STOP!!! This place is terrible! There is a reason why the rooms are so cheap! \n I arrived at 2 am on a Sunday with my friend. When i made my reservation i made it clear that i needed separate beds. After checking in and  totally exhausted we get to our room and find out that its one bed. so i go back down stairs with all of my luggage and talk to the lady at the front desk. I tell her the situation and all she says is whoops! then she puts us in tower 4 ( if you are staying here, request to not stay in tower 4! its a maze to get to.)and doesn't ask if we want help with our bags or anything. Parking was terrible also! Please reconsider before booking. Scrap up an extra $30 and stay somewhere else. The only good thing about this place is that Hash House a-go-go is located here. (amazing food! and the best breakfast you will ever have!) Hash house will receive a separate review."
0,"Had dinner Monday night. Had the Fillet $43.00. it was the size of a large ping pong ball. overcooked and too much salt. Way WAY overpriced. It was literally three bites. I was with a group, so did not send it back. I should have. I all most that it was a practical joke. I quess I should have ordered a simple pizza!"
0,"Well what to say about Zenobia....\n\nI used to be a big fan. I would have recommended them to anybody. Then I went in on a Friday night (Saturday morning) at 2:45 am after wrapping up a nice night of clubbing. \n\nI don't expect pristine service at 2:45 am, but nobody in my group of 4 was either belligerent or rude. We were very friendly and happy to be in Zenobia. One member of my party actually ordered 2 kebabs, for himself and his girlfriend at home. So 4 of us purchased 5 kebabs. The man was friendly when selling to us, then when we finished our purchases, I asked for the toilet, and he said they had no toilet...... odd.\n\nThen, at 2:50, he said, \""in 10 minutes, we close\"" ... at 2:55 (because I check my watch constantly, I knew precisely the time he gave us) he kicked us out. He was very rude, and there were about 7 other diners with us....all given the boot. \n\nI understand kicking out the drunks at closing time, but I was with a group of three, along with a group of 5, and we were all given the boot 5 minutes before closing. \n\nI appreciate Zenobia's five \u00a3 mixed kebabs, which are not cheap, but I protest the horrendous service! I was regular customer, but now I will definitely be going elsewhere for my kebab needs!\n\nAs to the \""healthy\"" food mentioend by Marj C on 19/7/2010: I was never asked what sauce or sides I would like with my kebab. I do not want sauce, and was never given the option.... Omitting sauce by default is not the same as offering \""healthy\"" options, but rather it is simply omitting the OPTION of health."
1,My sister and I always go here as did my father when he was alive.  They are always polite and remember our names.  I've taken others as well and they enjoyed it!!
1,Zink has a new menu. Drop what you're doing and go order the NY Strip sliders (maybe a couple orders) and you will be transported to hamburger heaven. Easy as that!
0,"Worst experience for a first timer, which just made me a last timer. I will never go back to this place. They couldn't get any of my orders right. I ordered 2 Salmon sandwiches, ended up with only one, but was charged for 2. Then I thought a coffee sounded good, they got one of them but forgot mine, so after I reminded them, they couldn't grasp what a blended decaf peppermint mocha was. Once I tasted it I sent it right back and asked for my $ back. I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE."
0,"If I could give this ZERO stars I would. My boyfriend had service with this company on a quarterly basis. They were instructed to call each time they were coming so we could have someone meet at the house to let them in to do interior and put the dogs away for the exterior. Right off the bat they would just show up and then call saying they were there when no one was clearly there to put the dogs out. They did this for months! Then they just starting leaving their service slip saying they did the back yard and would call to reschedule interior yet we never received a call. They could not do the exterior of the backyard due to a lock on the gate that we have so they were only servicing the front yard and not calling to reschedule anything. We tried calling them to find out what's going on and nothing got resolved. They then stopped servicing all together cause we refused to pay for a service we were not receiving. We then received a letter saying they wanted us to pay them the remainder of the contract (mind you a contract we never received) and it was no small amount or they were sending us to collections. I have since called them spoke to a Robin and I asked her to pull all the service tickets and also the so called \""contract\"" who informed me on 9/5 that she would email everything. 9/5 & 9/6 came and went and nothing received so I called and spoke to Robin again who told me give her til 9/8. 9/8 came and went and still nothing! Now, we have to fight with the collection agency because they wont cooperate. I DO NOT recommend them to anyone! I do not know of any pest control company that has contracts anymore other than 1 and that is only if you get termites. Other than that no one has contracts. They can not provide us with the signed service tickets nor this \""contract\"". Fed up and frustrated!"
0,"The Yelp review I was going to write when I left the store lost a full star by the time I got home, for one simple reason:\n\nDickey's can not get an order right to save their effing lives.\n\nEvery time I've had takeout from there, something has always been missing. Sometimes it's something small, like the onion and pickle that are supposed to come with every platter but only show up about half the time. Sometimes it's something medium and annoying like a missing side. Sometimes it's something mission-critical, like the bacon on a baked potato. They did, however, make sure to include BBQ sauce! With my baked potato, so the bag had a smoked meat aroma that taunted me in the absence of the missing bacon. #fail\n\nIt's a shame too, because the food here is actually decent. At $4, those giant stuffed baked potatoes are a great deal. Their BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but it's certainly good for a quick-service counter joint, and I'd sooner eat here than the flavorless Famous Dave's and the stupefyingly overrated Memphis Championship BBQ. And they get bonus points for serving smoked turkey year-round.\n\nOther good meats include the pulled pork and the hot link. The best sides here are the waffle fries, cole slaw, potato salad and baked potato casserole. The sweet tea is as it should be, and they offer complimentary pickles and soft-serve ice cream, which is a nice value-added touch.\n\nThe BBQ sauce is perfectly acceptable but nothing special. They have sweet and hot variants for a little spice of life. I prefer the hot, although I don't think it even has the slightest bit of heat to it.\n\nBottom line on this place? Decent BBQ, especially for the price, but be sure to audit your order, because the only thing you can depend on with their service is its complete lack of dependability."
0,"It was very crowded. I was pleased that the wait time for a table was not long, but that was my only pleasure from this place. The service was poor. I asked for a glass of water that I never did get. It was hard to flag down my waiter, who I think went on break after taking my order. My food was barely warm. Then to top it all off, I had to wait in a very long line to pay my bill. There was only 1 cashier working, until they got enough sense to get a second cashier. Gee, the line goes down the restaurant, we better get a second cashier.  Why did it take so long to figure this out?"
1,"I was excited to try Windsor since I'm such a huge fan of Postino, and didn't know what to expect. I ordered the corn dog poppers as an appetizer and the burger as my entree. The sandwich was satisfying and what I expected, and I am looking forward to getting one of Windsor's signature cocktails when I go back. They have a nice open patio I plan on enjoying this summer with bigger groups of people, and Churn next door looks amazing."
1,Quite a spread.  This place has a little of everything.  The real amazing part is that everything is excellent.
0,"DONNABELLAHAIREXTENSIONS.COM\nSELLS NEARLY ALL THE SAME BRANDS AS CAYON FALLS BUT FOR 1/2 THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!                           Kimberly A., You are correct the hair did not wave like I expected it to. That is because I asked Mary to sell me wavy hair. And she told me it was. I could not find any writing on the packaging specifying wether the hair I purchased was wavy or straight so I trusted in your store manager that she was telling me the truth. No customer can walk into your store and walk behind the counter and pick out the hair they would like to purchase. They have to ask for help and one of your store \""managers\"" gets it for them. But yet when I call and ask why the wavy hair I thought I purchased was straight they tell me I must not have properly communicated what type of hair I wanted, and to come in and spend another couple hundred dollars. Superb customer service! In the future it might help to improve your return business if you could properly train your \""store managers\"" to know the difference between silky straight hair and body wave hair."
1,"As if the atmosphere in the Hotel Valley Ho wasn't already fantastic, this little area near the hotel' lounge and bar area is understated and upscale at the same time. I went for happy hour and truly enjoyed the options. I went with the ZuZu Senorita which was a signature cocktail while my friend got the sparkling wine, both $4. I liked my drink but the rim needed salt and perhaps a little less tequila (it was a very HAPPY hour). We each ordered a side. I got the prime rib dip and she orded the pretzels with chips and cheese. Each of us were in food heaven. The prime rib dip came with an au jau sauce and had the most melt in your mouth cheese on top. The meet was fall off the bone good and the bread was perfect. Two little slices were enough to satisfy a happy hour hunger. \n\nI would def go back here for fancy drinks with a friend, hopefully grab a sit on the patio outside. Parking is complimentary valet and the car boys are very sweet."
1,"I sometimes get annoyed with American establishments that try to use Asian cultures/ concepts as an \""exotic\"" marketing gimmick so I secretly try to avoid Tao a few times when I was in Vegas. But when my friends and I stayed at the Venetian and kept getting little invitation cards, got put on the guest list, and eventually saw the \""red carpet\"" outside the club, I gave in.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful night. Things started a little hectic at the beginning as we admired the \""girls\"" and the dancers while we tried to stay on our feet. We were pushed around for a while in the crowded dancer floor and after we finally got some drinks, we decided to find a better space-we ended up in a much smaller room with much lower density. Despite some asshole spilling his whole drink down my friend and I, we were able to recover from the disaster, had good drinks, dance around in a decent amount of space, met a super cool couple and had a blast!"
1,"My mother in law was in for a visit and we were in the mood for soup and salad. I had been wanting to try Caf\u00e9 Zupas and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. As we walked in, the young lady at the front door explained the menu and offerings - this was very helpful seeing it was our first visit. It was busy, but the staff at the counter took the time to explain things and let us taste a few of the soups, which was very helpful. \n\nI had the chicken enchilada chili and the BBQ chicken salad. Both were great. My mother in law loved her food as well. The meal also came with a chocolate covered strawberry. It actually was a lot of food.  The only bland part of the meal was the bread that came with the soup - it was nothing special. \n\nThe dining room was very nice and the attendant in the room was a really sweet, helpful lady.\n\nI'll definitely plan on returning in the future."
0,Staff is nice enough but EVERY TIME I come here it over an hour wait and the doc has the bedside manners of a turnip.

1,"Really good smoked meat sandwich.\n\nHere's my dilemma when it comes to delis...\n\nthe sandwiches are made with a ridiculous amount of meat. seriously, who eats like that? so, i always have to take some out just so i can wrap my mouth around it. but then i have a pile of useless sandwich meat begging to be eaten. \nCan i should i ask for more bread and eat the equivalent of 2 sandwiches? or do i just leave the sad pile of meat? \n\ni usually do the former followed by a trip to the drugstore for some alka-seltzer."
1,"Awesome east coast style deli food with a fresh and healthy update, this is the best, we go there all the time"
0,"In my previous review, I made the argument for Charcos in how they avoided the dreaded \""drama plate\"". I ordered something interesting and it managed to taste great without any sort of micro-management.\n\nAlas, I must step down a few paces from my previous praise, because the drama has creeped back in. What used to be gourmet chicken on a budget is now a roll of the dice.\n\nThe confidence from my first visit seems gone. Employees seem confused; not sure whether to charge up front or when the food is done. Or what goes on a particular sandwich. The wait time has doubled. The \""wraps\"" sometimes use burger buns instead of pitas. The fries sometimes come without that seasoning that worked so well. It's like a roll of the dice with your twenty dollar bill on the line.\n\nWhere is that Charcos we were first enthralled with? I hope it comes back soon, because I'm not sure it's worth being burned a third or fourth time by something on the production line."
1,"I had never used Sixt before, but did so over the holidays since they were about 33% cheaper than any of the \""major\"" rental companies. I had used Fox and Payless in the past and did not have good experiences, so I was a little wary about trying Sixt.\n\nWhen we arrived at the counter, we were the only ones in line. The other counters had long waits, so that was a plus for us. I signed up for some automated kiosk check-in, but learned when we arrived that it did not yet exist. Kind of strange, but since there wasn't a line, it wasn't really an issue. \n\nThe car we rented had low miles and still had the new car smell. Leaving the lot was easy (almost too easy... no person in a booth to check our credentials before leaving the lot), and returning was just as simple. The agent checked the car upon return and emailed us a receipt. They did put a hold of $250 on my credit card when we left the lot, and though I don't recall other rental car companies doing this, it didn't really affect me. I didn't need to cancel or change anything, so I can't speak to any issues with that. Overall, the process getting in and out was a breeze, and the car was above average."
1,"This place rocks. As other reviewers have said, its not the newest, fanciest or most technologically endowed theater, but its clean, comfortable, and shows some independent and foreign films. \nSince moving to the Westside of town, we've enjoyed this theater on a couple different occasions. We've found it to be very clean, have friendly staff and never be too full. The prices are still consistent with other theaters, so you won't be able to save a ton of money, but you won't have to deal with  the smoke of a casino or the crowds of some of the newer theaters. \nThere are a lot of great places to eat around the theater, which makes it very convenient for a date night, and it is not too hard to find a close parking spot which is nice for a cold winter night or hot summer day."
1,"Their pistachio frappe is soooo delish! But because I went around 7pm, not a lot of desserts to choose....wish there was a Henderson location so that I could go all the time!"
1,I've been to several Brazilian Steakhouses in and out of the USA and this was definitely the best. The food and service are both amazing.
0,"Location: Plateau-ish area, near Laurier metro. Street parking available but pay attention to the signs.\n\nThe place: It's small, decor is minimal, and there's a pool table that in't very strategically positioned in the middle of the place. I'm still trying to figure that one out since if you happen to be sat right behind said pool table, you risk having your back or arse poked with a stick. Anyway. The theme here, is 80s-90s, which I can tolerate in small doses but not so much for an entire evening. The wait staff (at least the gals) are outfitted in retro 80s gear and the music being played is genre, Londonbeat, Madonna, Micheal Jackson etc. \n\nThe food: I went for Burger week. Will I go back? Nope. I orderd the veggie burger, also known as the Humus burger; while the bun itself was actually quite good, the patty was just this brown lump that, at first glance, didn't look very appetizing. Was it good? It was OK but I've had better Falafel-style patties elsewhere. Half my burger was missing the bottom so I basically ate that half with a knife and fork while I ate the other as a burger should be eaten: with my bare hands. The burger was topped with lettuce, tomato, exactly two sweet potato chips, and was accompanied by coleslaw. No fries included. As far as burgers go, it was dull. The coleslaw was spicy and just not good. Spicy coleslaw just doesn't work for me. My date ordered a meat burger that she said was burnt, and the accompanying fries were cold. \n\nService: The service was fine, but the waitress didn't explain the two different burgers that were on offer for Burger week (we told her that's why we were there). It was also incredibly slow to actually get our food - maybe that's why the fries were cold. On the up side, we weren't pressed to leave when were done. \n\nPrice point: $11 for the veggie burger. Personally, if you're going to give me a mediocre burger and not include fries, $11 is overpriced."
0,"A chain, so the items are still the same famous coffee we have all grown to love. The staff is very courteous, I don't know what it is though, no matter how small the order is, they ALWAYS mess up my order.\nALWAYS.\n\n\nIf I don't get to work on time this morning, because I had to come inside to fix an order I told them precisely in the drive through, today will be my last day here. \n\n\nHappy trails!"
0,If you like pizza that taste like it has a cardboard crust than this is the place for you
1,"Excellent Filipino BBQ at this place.  I was visiting Phoenix for work and needed to satisfy my Pinoy craving and this place hit the spot.  I'm not sure what the owner's name was, but she made sure I was taken care.  The liempo here is one of the best I've ever had so make sure to order that.  The place is located in a shopping plaza so keep that in mind when you're looking for it."
0,"When dining at the Bellagio, I'm aiming for a 4 or 5 star experience.  This was way below expectations! The service was extremely spotty.  \nWe had a large party, and I do understand if certain mistakes are made during busy hours.  However, they weren't super crowded.  Took a while for everything to come out.  What I really disliked the most was the waiter dropping off everything at certain spots of the table.  If you're a fancy sushi restaurant, wouldn't you at least know or remember who ordered which food and where it went? Also, there was clearly timing issues, and dishes came out one or two at a time.  For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it.... And the waiter was pretty clueless also! The food itself was pricy, yet it was decent. The edamame was good, as it was well seasoned.  Besides that, definitely not worth it.  I would only go here again if I was forced to... If not, definitely visit other sushi places on the strip!!"
1,"This is one of the nicer Noodles and Co restaurants.  They have a nice open dining area, a pretty nice view and an ok balcony/patio area.  The patio is a little small.\nOur food is always excellent here.  \nThe staff could be a little bit more friendly.  Sometimes I get cheerful and other times I get disinterest.   Give me some smiling faces and some new flavors and they could go to a 5."
1,"I came here for my birthday a few days ago and I have to say that I really do enjoy the food and ambience of the restaurant.  Our meal began with a bowl of flour tortilla chips (fried) that were simply tasty and memorable.  The salsa was a green (tomatillo) and a slightly hotter red salsa.  The salsa and chips cannot be beat!\n\nI ordered a Hatch chilli and chicken combo that was true New Mexican in taste.  The one thing that I truly love about the food is that the sour cream is on the side, not all over.   I have a problem with dairy and sour cream can easily ruin my meal.\n\nThe server (part owner) was attentive and knowledgeable.  My son decided that he wanted to play with a small armor suit in the background (sans the knight).  The mask fell apart, but the restaurant and management were supportive and light hearted about it.  He had a smiley face pancake and fries, quite the meal for a four year.  My wife had the fajitas.  It was served with the hot peppers on the side, not to overwhelm someone who does not cherish the finer qualities of chiles.\nThe restaurant is small and has a romantic/quaint setting.  The price for a couple dining (no alcohol) is about $30.00 per couple (before tip).\nMy only suggestion - serve some desert!\n\nThe ambience plus food for $30.00 per couple is a well deserved treat, just do not touch the shining armor in back!"
0,"Mastro's has me so spoiled that I find Ruth's to be like a deflated balloon. I've never been a huge RC fan, but I think they used to be so much better once upon a time! At this price point, I can think of several much better steak houses!"
0,You can do better than this. Incompetent doctor(s) and office staff. I am a nurse and to characterize this office as nothing but a frustration is a compliment.
1,Some place warm. A place where the beer flows like wine. Where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talkin about a little place called Poppys.
1,"My boyfriend had a conference for work here at the M Resort. It was Wednesday-Saturday and I tagged along. The room was amazing. The beds were comfortable and everything looked new and clean.\n\n The bathroom was LARGE with double sinks, a large soaking tub with a window view into the rest of the room/looking out at our view of the pool and in the distance-the Strip, a large shower with bench seat and even a t.v. screen built in to the vanity mirror!! I could watch t.v while putting on my make-up or doing my hair which was a nice perk. \n\nRestaurant food in the Resort was delicious!\n\nThe gym was fancy! Not your typical hotel gym with a few machines. Looks like they took the time to make it nice (you have to pay to use it but if you are needing a workout while on vacation it will be worth the money).\n\n\nParking was free, albeit they didn't have a place for you to pull up to the front lobby and unload. That was reserved for Limos/Taxis and Valet only. So if you self park, you have to carry your luggage through the Casino to get to the guest room elevators. But hey, it was free so I'd take that over having to pay for resort parking at $10/day like other places I've been to. \n\nNow, the only reason I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because they have a ridiculous schedule for their pool. It is seasonal only--so forget about swimming or using the hot tub if you visit in the off season. It's Vegas---tourist town. People like to swim, sit in the hot tub on their vacation!! It is also only open from 10am-6pm during the open season!!! The pool itself is great. It has a perimeter of shallow calf-deep water where they have lounge chairs in the water. Then the rest of the pool is only 4-5 ft deep. Perfect for cooling off when the weather is hot. Plenty of lounge chairs outside the pool and they have cabanas to rent and awesome pool side food and beverage service. Free ice water if you don't want to drink alcohol but want to stay hydrated. So it sucks if you are in a business meeting all day and then want to relax in the pool in the evening, like my boyfriend. It is 90 degrees at 6pm and they close the pool. It doesn't make sense that a resort in the desert would close their pool when the sun is still out and the temperature is hot!\n\nOverall I had a great time and I would defintely stay there again."
0,"I visited this place earlier tonight, I was told by a bouncer the entry fee was $27 which included a two drink minimum, my friend was told the entry fee was $12 which included two drinks by a different bouncer. We were searched for weapons without notice or being asked for consent, then were taken to the cashier. The cashier asked for $28 per person and said that was for two drinks and a \""free\"" cover charge or we could pay the entry fee of $66 total for entry and drinks. My friend said he didn't want to go here anymore just as I was paying, the bouncer physically grabbed him, pulled him away from me and took him to the door as the cashier grabbed $30 out of my hand and handed me two pink receipts for drinks and told me I had already paid and couldn't be refunded. He long story short is this place ROBBED me, ASSAULTED my friend, LIED about prices. The bouncer also physically kept his hand on my shoulder as the cashier snatched my money away."
0,"I finally gave Sprinkles a chance. One star for interior decoration and another star for decent service. I'm pretty picky when it comes to cupcakes, but I came out of here thinking that I could make myself a better cupcake with my own oven/kitchen. The cake itself was really dry and crumbly and I'm not really a fan of thick icing. Maybe I should have tried their ice cream or sandwich, but with just their basic cupcake really lacking, I'm not sure the specialty treats would have been too much better. However, I would say try it out for yourself, see if you like cupcakes made the Sprinkles way!"
1,"It's true. This is not the same Beijing Noodle cafe any more. And we definitely want to know if they opened shop elsewhere in town.  Having said that...we had a great experience here!  We ordered some of our old favorites from this place to compare: pork pot stickers, Mongolian beef, and General Tso's chicken. All were fantastic!  A nice little spicy kick in the entries and lean beef and white meat chicken. The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely continue to come here!"
1,Yummy pizza and great service! I will return !!!
0,"Poor Management!!! I wish I would have read the other reviews before eating at Bandera tonight. I was a long time fan and I'm still a big fan of Hillstone on Camelback. But will not go back to Bandera until I'm notified the manager \""Mark Poltntan\"" is no longer employed by Hillstone."
0,"I'm on a lifelong quest to search out restaurants that celebrate the kitschy Polynesian fanciness of the 1950's. Flaming pu-pu platters, drinks that come in tiki mugs and suckling pig. The whole Trader Vic's experience. It means that whenever I find a place that promises such a shangri-la, I am forced to try it. \n\nI am regularly disappointed. Tonight is no exception. \n\nThe decor is ok, but the ambience and menu are 100% cheap family restaurant. I feel utterly betrayed. \n\nOh well. At least my Mai-tai is strong.\n\nOh, and the kitchen is slow. Score."
1,"I'm a Starbucks freak, however had had horrible experiences at some locations. But this location is great. I would stop in on the way to church or work. The drive they is always quick and they have never messed up an order. Recently the price they have me for my drink was high, so I questioned them about it. For the inconvenience they gave me my drink for free! Great customer service and the baristas are down to earth! Try this Starbucks out!"
1,"Yum yum yum!\nI'm usually not a fan of gelato cause most places make gelato that's way too sickeningly sweet (especially in the States). This place, however, has changed my mind about this frozen delicacy just a bit. Serving gelato, froyo, and icecream, Kem CoBa has a wide assortment of almost any delicious frozen treat you're craving on a hot summer's day. My bf and I stopped by this place after hitting up Montreal's two big bagel shops (Fairmont and St. Viateur's) since we were melting from the afternoon heat and needed something cool and refreshing. My bf got a scoop of matcha green tea gelato and I got a scoop of mango. Both were delicious! The matcha tasted just like green tea should; earthy, grassy, fresh, slightly sweet but not overpoweringly so. The mango was tart, light, also the perfect level of sweetness, and again, very fresh (like it was made from fresh mangos).\nIf you're stopping by Fairmont bagels, you might as well stop by here on your way down the street cause they're literally a few steps from each other (I think, if I recall correctly, they're only separated by one shop in between).\n\nFood: 4/5 -- delicious!\nService: 4/5 -- friendly, prompt, welcoming\nAtmosphere: 4/5 -- clean, brightly colored, fun and quirky (a wall of bubbles), but no seating area (although there's plenty of benches outside to sit on so it's not a problem)\n\nOverall: 4/5 -- great!"
1,"This restaurant is my first experience with Malaysian food.  I really enjoyed it and have been back many times since. The beef satay is one of the best things I've tasted in Chinatown. This is family owned and they are the employees.  I LOVE supporting family owned businesses, especially when the family is actually there working!\n\nPROS: The menu has a picture for EVERY item listed.\n             Homemade Green Curry \n             Lo Mee ~ noodles in homemade soy sauce, topped with chicken & mushrooms\n             Hokkien Char Mee\n             Roti canai\n             ***The COCONUT PUDDING**** Served INSIDE a coconut ~ ice cold!! \n\nCONS: Could use music or something atmospheric.\n\nThey also have really cool lighting fixtures if you happen to look up.

0,"It pains me extremely to give Amore only 3 stars!!  We have been going to/ordering from here very often for over a year, even when I was diagnosed with Celiac and had to go gluten-free. I waited patiently only ordering Chicken Vesuvio, until they recently started carrying gluten-free products.  \n\nNow I realize when ordering in I take the risk of being contaminated, but thankfully not only am I very aware  but as well am a bit paranoid...  I have never had a problem ordering from there gluten or otherwise, until tonight!!  I ordered gluten-free pasta and received the complete opposite in WHEAT!!  I called questioning and it was treated nonchalantly as if a pizza arrived with wrong toppings rather than the fact I was almost poisoned, which would land me in the hospital immediately...  Not only were they completely flippant about what just happened,. I even needed to be the one to bring up about being refunded!  After a brief verbal brawl I finally just gave the phone back to the delivery guy, since he was yelling for it back, he gave us our refund and I handed him back the re-made meal, there was no way I was eating their food ever again!\n\nAs I said before, I hate deducting stars from a place I love so much but if them giving me wheat pasta wasn't bad enough they showed little to no remorse to a VERY FREQUENT customer!!  Not cool!!  Not to mention even if  it didn't work out for me to eat there again and feel comfortable, I have a very hungry boyfriend whose always enjoyed the taste of their foodlll Until the truth of their personalities came out!\n\nUPDATE: This review has gone down to 1 star after being treated in such a POOR manner by the manager/owner.  He truly lost me as a customer when he said \""I only ordered this stuff for YOU POEOPLE.\""  And continued on stating that he would take if off if he could.  I have never thought the bigotry I would endure in life would be because of an illness which limits what I can eat!  Shame on this place!  I could have become seriously ill from their mistake and his only response was a chuckle saying, \""What, am I supposed to sign off on all Gluten-Free items that leave the kitchen?\""  No Jackhole, you are supposed to educate your staff when you take on the responsibility of serving a very large community of people who are doing this not by choice but for survival!"
0,Its airport food. Had the Cesar salad with chicken. My husband ordered a pizza with pepperoni.  My salad came 10 min before his pizza. I thought that was odd. By the time I finished his meal had finally arrived. My salad was very over dressed so make sure you ask for dressing on the side. His pizza was okay.  Would not come back.
1,"Best dog park hands down. Believe me I would know ive been to all of em in town but they dont have anything on this park. The dog park is on the corner of eatern and warm springs and there are 2 sections: dogs up to 35lbs & 35lbs and up. I take teddy to the 35lbs and under and its usually the same regulars and their dogs that I see there which is great. Everyone knows each other, cleans up after their dogs, help clean water bowls, they are even a few people who make rounds around the park with a pooper scooper just making sure to pick up anything someone may have missed. Most dogs are friendly I have yet to see a fight break out just the occasional snapping at each other with a growl. No big deal. Safe enough and the dogs love it!!! Theres usually someone there at all times of the day but most people go at 6:30am-7:30am and 6:30-7:30pm. Oh and a lot of dog parks dont have any grass this one does so thats also a plus :)"
0,This place won't be open very long if they're not staffed! I just walked in stood there for 10 min & no one was there to help me so I left!
1,"Oh baseball, how I missed you!  We came here with a friend who was visiting.  Tickets were pretty inexpensive and so was parking.  It was a cheap night out at the ballpark for 3 people!  \n\nThe stadium wasn't packed (in fact I was a little saddened by how empty it was but it became a bit of a chilly evening and was early in the season).  We received friendly service from everyone there and the stadium was pretty clean.  They had your typical overpriced game food, but we went on dollar beer night and definitely got our money's worth :)  We arrived early and got to see the players signing autographs for some of the kiddos in the park.\n\nThe 51s totally kicked butt that night.  There were some obnoxious drunks heckling them from behind us but it made for an even more fun evening because of how ridiculously loud and stupid they were lol.  \n\nWill definitely consider going back, especially for some of the better giveaways, since the tickets are so cheap and you can get a good seat."
0,"Went in for a couple of burgers combos at the Glendale location and was very disappointed with size of the burger they are now serving. It use to be one of the valleys biggest burgers. That was what made it great. Now it feels like you are getting a burger the size of a big mac. I dont mind paying a little more, but dont cut the size of the burger! No more Lenny runs for us. The Burger Shop still has the big burger. Sorry Lennys!  Big mistake. You lost 2 good customers and will not recommend to anybody any more once i share my coment on Facebook. Good luck to you."
0,"Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about."
1,"Great store, my home ... They are the best during the week in the AM. Their weekend team needs to learn from the A-Team but it's still better than some other stores. I mean it's Starbucks after all... Yeah I'll wait."
1,"This wee coffee shop is always busy! They always have posters up on the walls advertising the next gig or concert in Edinburgh's ally's. Because of this, I always think it's pretty cool!\n\nThey don't have many places to sit other than a couple stools at the window, which are almost always occupied. But it doesn't really matter, you can get your food/coffee and eat en route or find a nice seat somewhere - I personally go down to Dynamic Earth and use their picnic benches.\nTheir food menu isn't substantial but is good nevertheless. It's relatively cheap and can give you a student discount if you ask nicely.\n\nI really like this place as it is en route to my classes and is cheaper than the bigger chains. Their coffee is hot though, so if you're not a heat-freak, like me, then leave it to cool down for a while. Your tongue will thank you for it."
0,"I can truthfully say that I have spent a huge percentage of my entertainment dollar in Vegas at Krave. I happened upon the place in its heyday, back when you were just as likely to see movie stars and fashion party names grooving to DJ Morningstar (seriously, once I saw Ritchie Rich AND Amanda LePore there in the same night) as you were fantastic queens and their little manservants. The staff was top notch, the mixes were masterpieces and the service in the VIP area was flawless.\n\nI wish I could still say the same today. Instead of an overall rating search, look at the trend of the ratings for Krave and you'll see that the customer experience has steadily gone downhill, perhaps stemming from the establishment's recent bankruptcy filing and reduction in quality talent. The drinks are overpriced, the cover charge seems egregious and the cocktail waiters are completely a mixed bag, some are distracted (overworked?) and disengaged while others seem to genuinely be interested in serving. The carpet in the VIP area was so dirty that my high heels would stick like glue in certain areas. \n\nWe ordered bottle service, including a bottle of absinthe, but apparently they didn't even know how absinthe should be served and had no sugar cubes on hand. I'm not asking for silver slotted spoons or anything but if you have no clue as to the appropriate mixers, you should take it off the menu, hmmm? And at $350 a bottle, if you're out of Grey Goose, you send one of the little bois to the 7-11 up the street to make your clients happy, right? Ok, and also, my diamond shoes were too tight, but let's talk about what really matters: the club itself. The dancers are stuffing their jocks with what seems to be Chunky soup cans, to the point that it's laughable, and the DJ? Oh my god. So not good. Even the staff was commenting that he sucked. What's more, despite the fact that we were dropping close to a thousand dollars in bottle service, the owner of the club decided to block our view of the dance floor and then treated us so disrespectfully when we asked him to move that I couldn't believe he was actually the owner. Seriously, if you treat your supposed VIP customers like this, I'm not surprised that you're facing bankruptcy, Kelly Murphy.\n\nAnd what used to be a crowd rife with a half dozen drag queens, there hasn't been a single queen to be seen the last two visits. Perhaps they are the club's canary in a coal mine and Krave is simply no longer fabulous enough to entertain them. The real tell here is that despite the fact that we were last there on the night that Krave was serving as the Logo afterparty for the Lady Gaga concert, at what should have been the prime thick of the party scene, the dance floor was starting to thin out considerably. It seems that most people were there just to see if the Lady herself would show up and when it became clear that she wasn't, they headed for greener pastures.  I'm following their lead and heading to Piranha next time."

1,"Let me just say, this gym is not your typical gym.  First you have to work.  There is no slacking. Prescribed workouts let you know what you will be doing for the day and take no more than 30 minutes.  But that is the most painful 30 minutes of your life.  Everyone gets a personal trainer, yes everyone.  And they make that work out easier.  Between motivation, form correction and their great attitudes, you go in thinking \""I can't do that\"" and leave wondering \""How did I just do that\"".\n\nGive these guys a chance and they will change your attitude and motivation."
1,"It's Trader Joe's!!!  If you don't do at least some of your grocery shopping here you are really missing out. Breads, cheeses, coffee, organic veggies- great quality at surprisingly cheap prices. A little crazy on weekends but everybody seems to be having fun and there is always something neat on sale. Best grocery shopping experience in Charlotte."
0,"Headline: Get the appetizers, skip the burger.\n\nI love Burgers is in the restaurant and shopping area within the Palazzo / Venetian complex.  It looks like a diner and feels like a diner, but you won't pay like a diner - you'll pay much much more. \n\nFirst off, what did I like?  Nom Noms - fried pieces of mac and cheese.  They also do a nice selection of beers, including a Chimay Trappist White, which might be my favorite beer, and it goes well with fried food.  These golden nuggets of awesome were delicious, and definitely turning up for.\n\nUnfortunately, that is the only thing good about it.  The burgers were completely tasteless.  I opted for the \""I love bacon\"" burger - which I was thinking, given the amount of bacon on and supposedly in it, that it might actually taste good.  It didn't taste good or bad - there was no taste to it.  Really bad.  The sweet potato fries were flat and they didn't come with anything to dip them into.  This was really disappointing.\n\nService was bad as well.  The burgers came out before the appetizer, the bar screwed up, and we couldn't get the attention of our waitress when we needed her.  \n\nSo - my advice - sit at the bar, order the Nom Noms, and then leave for some decent food elsewhere."
1,"The family and I decided to go here for brunch. It was my first time there and it's a cute little place with a fairly inviting atmosphere. \n\nI had the Huevos Motulenos and it was fantastic. There is an interesting mix of flavors within it but they all work very well. We also ordered the pancakes. I am not a pancake person, however those were very tasty and I would order them again. \n\nI will definitely be back!"
0,Not a great hotel.
0,I am not sure why it is a one dollar sign establishment. For a family of 5 with 3 being under six years old we spent over $55. This was without drinks. \n\nThe service was mediocre at best. The chicken kabob did have good flavor and the humus wasn't too bad. However we will not be returning.
1,"Excellent hotel! We got an upgrade to a one-bedroom suite with kitchen, two bathrooms (with jacuzzi) and bedroom. Very clean, modern, luxurious room. There is a shuttle bs to the Caesar's Palace, as the hotel is near the end of the Strip. I would definitely return to this hotel."
0,"Ok, so the grand opening hasn't even happened yet for this place, but sorry Im gonna miss it.  Not...\n\nA group of eight of us show up tonight for \""dinner\"" and drinks.  We get seated way the hell in the back.  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd.  Two graphic designers, three filmmakers, a photographer and some friends.. ok?  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca, so the people are.. well... less classy? The guy was digging himself a hole.\n\nSo we order drinks, which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table.  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min... he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu.   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole, everyone else orders something a bit similar.  \n\nConversation is picking up while we wait for our food.  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long.  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives. Probably about 45min later.  Here's the best part....\n\nSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes, we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old.  That's right.. each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each.  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max..  pathetic.\n\nAfter our tiny little dinner, we ask for our bills..The waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once, no.. instead he brings one or two at a time. Guess he wants us to stick around? Who knows.. Finally the two filmmakers get their bill, pay and they leave.. couple other of our friends do the same.  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill.  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card.  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card.  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit.. guess how much? Oh about 50 cents.. \n\nHe signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy place.\n\nThe place actually does look pretty cool.  Too bad the service sucks and the food is barely appetizer quality at best."
0,Sooooooooo slow. Open tables all over the place but still waited 35 minutes to be seated. Once seated waited a long time for waiter to even check if we wanted water.  Food was good but not worth the wait. Hate to see how this place runs when all the tables are taken
0,I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!
1,"I like this place. It's clean and big, and always has a ton of staff. They are incredibly friendly and do fast, great work. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Plus they always accommodate you to make sure you can get in, even as a walk-in customer. They'll even stay late to make sure you get taken care of."
1,"In my opinion, the very best items at the buffet are the following: duck, waffle fries, sausage(not the jalape\u00f1o), burger shooters, miso soup self serve, crepes and lastly the sorbet. I appreciated the selection and the exotic foods, but some were mediocre. I am especially picky because I pride myself on eating excellent food on vacations, and with that said, I feel that most of the food could be better. The service was excellent; I enjoyed having the coffee pot at our table as well."
0,"Honestly, I normally do not write bad reviews, but future interested residents should read this. I do apologize and I'm sure with some company efforts to fixing these mistakes, this complex will no longer have any bad reviews. \n\nI lived here during the transition Orion at Hermosa Pointe became Trailside at Hermosa Pointe. Upon request for move out date, I first received a letter at our door stating there was a 90 day notice. Okay cool, so I put in the notice a little over a month later and they stated \""Oh sorry, your contract is with the previous company so you only have a 60 day notice. Now you owe an additional one month's rent after your lease.\""  My question to them was why would you put a letter at my door saying I had 60 days when I really only had 30? \n\nWhen I move, I like to paint the apartment to make it feel more at home. I always paint it back before I leave. I asked the lady at the office for the exact paint color and she told me the name and stated that I can get it anywhere including Home Depot. So I go and buy this paint and primer and begin re-painting when half way finished I notice it doesn't even match! I call maintenance and he comes in and tells me its the wrong paint and that I can only purchase it at a specific store. Okay... so why does the office not know this valuable information? So they ordered me the correct paint which I am thankful for that I didn't have to purchase another one.. however all of this time could have been saved if the office was more educated about these important rules. \n\n\nGate: Would always break every other week\n\nParking: hard to find if wanting to invite over a few guests. Sometimes they had to park across the street in the neighborhood and walk over. \n\nDog poop: one dog owner would hide their dogs poop under rocks. Every morning I would see squished dog poop smashed under rocks which makes the community look dirty due to a lazy dog owner. I honestly think it takes more effort to find a big enough rock and squish their dogs poop, instead of simply picking it up and throwing it away. Never got a chance to catch who was doing this. \n\nTip: Perhaps installing doggy bag poles around the complex like other apartments have will help this issue. \n\nBest thing about living here that I do miss is the convenient location of being next to North Mountain. Close enough to run to and a beautiful view of the city. Also, the convenience of living next to Scramble was a plus as well. Awesome breakfast."
1,"I would understand why this place currently holds 3.5 stars. But for me, Eli's was a great night out! The live band was actually pretty damn good (even though they hadn't much of an audience), and the service was even better.\n\nMy waiter was especially accommodating and very enthusiastic about the menu - usually a good sign. I ordered the petit filet mignon with mashed potatoes and garlic-sauteed broccoli, and WOW was it great! \n\nThe only downside for me was how expensive the mango daiquiri was... but hey I'm on vacation."
0,a disappointing trend to a what used to be a pretty good quality place?\nhave always eaten here multiple days during visits. our latest trip brought us here for dinner. The dinner special was a seared ahi salad for $12.95. Now by vegas standards $12.95 means something extraordinary. What we got was an iceberg lettuce salad with an overpowering asian vinegar dressing. Top it of with a medium rare ahi with strings in the middle!!!!! totally unacceptable. I've never had a bad meal here for years until this past week.\nso sad..once my favorite place drops to the bottom of the list. dared not try to order the sashimi and sushi for fear of more poor quality.\nis it the economy or lazy chef?
0,Sucks you have to give 1 star. Don't waste your money. It was dead when myself and 2 friends walked in. Machines are tight as hell. I ordered wings. Got 8 wings for $8.95 no no no don't wait your money!!!! I lost $80 on the machine and still have a $20 tap. BS !!!! My friend got charged for his soda when he was playing too. Not drinking alcohol at all!! Don't don't don't waste your money!!!!!!
1,"This whole place is super nice and modern. That makes sense since its all new.... There are ample shops and restaurants around and Aria is a very nice casino. Some of the art galleries are also very interesting too and a nice touch. Totally different from the rest of vegas and I like it. \n\nNot too much else to say, this really is a place to just go see!"
0,I really wanted to try this restaurant.  Since we're eating Mexican food tomorrow I didn't want to get a full meal so I ordered some guacamole as a good indicator of how the food is.\n\nI was disappointed.  The guacamole ($2 for 4 oz) was really peppery.  Not spicy with jalapeno peppers but black peppery.  \n\nBased on the guacamole I probably won't go back for a full meal.  Too bad because the food really did smell good when I walked through the restaurant.  The employees were also very nice.
1,This place is actually pretty good. Pretty much your run of the mill Chinese food. The staff is nice and the service is quick!
1,Pretty good subs. The pastrami is to die for.
0,"This is the tropical smoothie at the Stratosphere hotel, 2nd floor. It is not a full cafe with tables and chairs, just a walk up counter to order from. \n\nThey have a more limited menu and do not feature the full list of smoothies, including ones that have been around for a while. They do offer wraps and some breakfast items, however they do not carry all of the sandwiches found at the other locations. They also do not add punches to your VIP card for frequent users. \n\nTypically I have only seen 1 person working there at a time. Since this is a slower location I can understand limiting staff, however there is no 2nd person working so I have gone by a few times and was told by a neighboring retail shop that the trop smoothie is closed while the agent was on break. Also on slower days I find that they don't open at their scheduled time\n\nAs for quality I have no complaints, smoothies were good and so were the wraps I have tried. However, like I said they have a limited menu so minus cool points for not having my favorites on their :(\n\nStaff is pleasant, but not efficient as there is just one person trying to man it all. When someone orders a sandwich they have to go in the back and make it and you won't see them for a few minutes. \n\nAll in all, this is a last resort if I am in the strat and want to grab something quick, since it is a healthy option, however if there is a line, no way!"
0,Food is average but better than some other local places. Found the service to be sub-par. Based on some of the reviews I expected much better. With an improvement of service I may have given 3 stars.
1,"I took my 1989 Mercedes into Martin's yesterday to get a few items repaired, an oil change and a complete checkup since I just bought it last month with 175,000 mi on it and it has been running a tad rough and stalling once in a while and the ac fan went out and it wasn't the fuse. The  did the oil change and called me to say that whoever changed it last had stripped the drain plug and they wanted authorization for a $14.00 helicoil kit to retap and thread the plug. Very good since I told them I wanted to preauthorize any work or parts but I was very imopressed that they actually did so since no mechanic has ever done that. especially on such a cheap item (extra star for this).\n\nWhen the end of the day they said they didn't have the proper tools to check the ac fan motor or adjust the oddball fuel injection system but they did the complete checkout and found several major repair ityems in need of being done now or in the very near future and quoted me a written estimate for all needed work which I will use to get a second opinion at a German specialty shop.\n\nThe facility is as neat and clean as a dentist's office and both Staff members I dealt with were very helpful, informative and polite. I won't take my car back since they aren't equipped  for some of the work this  vintage Mercedes needs now (frost plugs, fuel injection and ac fan) but I will go to them for work they can do like oil changes, radiator/coolant flushes, tranny service and brakes.\n\nI live one block away and they are good but I have a 21 year old car that is also a fairly rare model (300CE). They are located on the morning drive side of 16th Street and open at 7:00am and close at 5:30pm."
1,"I had the fried pork chops , the chops were perfect . Nice crust and very moist. It came with cream gravy and mash potato. Oh yeah it came with two chops . Service was friendly and efficient."
1,"The other reviews for this place are really spot on. Cash only. No seating. Take out only. Be prepared with what you want (kind of feels like the soup nazi a little bit, and I am slow to make decisions - panic mode!). But it's pretty darn good.\n\nThe chicken is fresh and crispy. I had the 1/4 chicken dark meat meal. Really good chicken. They don't do fake/over processed  chicken, no boneless anything. And when we asked the lady at the register if they did chicken strips, she smiled and said, \""no, baby, this is real thing only.\""  Perfect response.  I'll definitely come back here, with a little blanket to sit on the grass."
1,"I bought a LivingSocial for Shawna's massage services and it was a decent enough massage. After some confusion on when I was supposed to come in, I made the appointment for a couple weeks out. Her salon is in a weird office building on Lake Mead in Henderson and is pretty much the only thing like it in the building. \n\nThe LivingSocial included aromatherapy, and she had about six choices to choose from. The room temperature was fine, the pressure was fine, everything was a-okay.\n\nI probably won't be back because I am a whore for cheap massages....LivingSocial and Groupon know how to get me. I can't justify going back somewhere and paying more when I know there's someone just as good who is offering a cheap-ass-cheap massage for a limited time. I would, however, recommend Shawna as her office is located nicely where no other massage is located and she did provide a good massage on a dime."

1,"There are a lot of detailed reviews here so I'll just list the main points:\n- HUGE club, indoor and outdoor.\n- Plays Top 40\n- Drinks are Vegas priced\n- Line up early @ 9:00pm to get in without a super long wait.  The line will be LONG.\n- Lots of azns (^_^).  That's kind of a no-no for me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm half Chinese, but I like to hang out with a more diverse group of people than the attention whoring Asian chicks and the rice rocket B-Boy crew.\n- Gets extremely crowded around midnight.  You won't be able to move.  Seriously.\n- $30 cover for men, $20 for women\n\nOverall, it's one of the best clubs I've been to and my husband, who hates clubs actually liked this place too, so have fun if you're deciding to come here while you're in Vegas!"
0,Save your $ and eat elsewhere. Their bar is good though.
0,The price is a little high for me.  They don't give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also
0,"I came here because I had gotten my eyebrow pierced in 1992 at the shop in phx by the original owner. So much for being unique and different, just kind of retro. They were so professional then I automatically thought of them when one of the holes in my ear closed after 30 years. When he told me he could just push something through and save me about 25 bux I thought. Well I guess I could that on my own but hey he's a pro and probably less chance of infection. But when the bill came for $78 I almost lost my teeth. Holy shinola, remind me to buy a pair if gloves and dip a straight pin in alcohol."

All Rights Reserved.  \n\nDateline 7 May 2009\nScottsdale, Arizona\n\n    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, \""That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.\""\n\n    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, \""I really like the onion naan.\""  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.\n\n    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was \""...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.\""  This has not substantiated, however.\n\n    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was \""Yummy.\""\n\n    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.

0,"We love a good dive bar. The atmosphere is unique. When you walk in thus place you are instantly confused. Pranksters Too can't make it's mind on what is wants to be. \n\nA live music venue? The Jester Room is a cramped little area to watch live music. Cool. But 'tis a dump. A sports bar? Yeah, TV's are everywhere, but I think they were purchased in 1995. HD...ever heard of it? A dive bar? Normally dive bars make up for bad music and out dated TV's with service. Not Pranksters Too. I finished my beer, asked for another round, and waited 45 minutes. Did I get a teeth cracking cold brew? No. My check. Easy to tip on that service. It was a Tuesday night.\n\nIf you have options, venture down to Dukes. Don't bother with Pranksters Too."
0,"Not quite sure how this place is pulling in so many five star reviews.  The only way I can see it is if you are ordering beef or lamb chop.  We were a party of 8 people and the 4 people that ordered the fish dishes were all disappointed.  I had the lambchop which was pretty good but did not blow me away.  Our friend who's 40th bday it was and is a BIG Bobby Flay fan loved his pork tenderloin and that was the most important thing since it was his birthday.  \nIn terms of service, they definitely lose a star ( or more ).  Was not impressed.  Our waiter was friendly enough but just going through the motions, this is Vegas buddy, there are a million places to eat, you gotta step it up !!  There was nothing terrible about the service through out most of the meal but nothing that stood out as good either.  The real kicker came though at the end of the meal when birthday boy went to the bathroom and I asked the waiter if he could bring out a piece of cake or something with a candle in it for the bday boy.  He said \""if you buy a dessert we can stick a candle in it \""  Excuse me!?!? We just dropped $800 and you can't splurge for a piece of cake, he came out instead with a ramekin with whipped cream and a candle stuck in it, was actually embarrassing.   Yes, we could have bought a piece of dessert but at that point it was the principal of the matter.\nThe other annoyance ( which happens at most places these days ) Is the automatic 18% gratuity for groups of 8 or more.  We were forced to tip this amount for sub-par service and spotty food.  \n\nHaving been to Vegas 9 times, I would say that I would not rush to eat here, there are soooooo many other better choices.  I have walked by this place about 50 times and never had an urge to go in, my hunch was right."
0,"Dr Fish is an ok oral surgeon.  However, his financial practices are shady.  He gave us a high estimate for surgery, 6k; we had to pay 4k before the surgery.  He then lowered the estimate after the surgery but refused to credit our card; we had insurance that paid 2k.  Two months later, we received a check for a small amount of the overage.  Their office person told me they dont do credit card credits.  I then called our insurance company and learned Dr. Fish had received $1800 more from us than the insurance co allowed in Dr Fish's agreement with the co.  Now we have to go fight him for the refund. His office person said, oh, insurance co's dont like to pay.  Hmmm--why contract with them then?  I would say, look elsewhere!"

Also, if you have a decuctable to meet make sure they are going through your insurance. As my son had two office visits at $100 and our decuctable is still the same. When I mention it to them they said we could be credited with our next office visit. I don't think so... we won't be going back!! Ps. Watch out for their PA, she's not that competent."
1,"Best. Doc's Office. EVER. \n\nMy primary care doc is Dr. Mansfield and she is AMAZING.... as is her assistant. I don't know what I'd do without them. I've also been to other docs if I'm really sick and can't get in to see her, and they've all been great. The front desk staff is very friendly and quick with processing people through. You never have to wait long with an appointment and they have a streamlined process to get people through to a doc quick, but not so quick that you feel like you're just a number. They listen to what you have to say and don't just give you meds for the sake of giving you meds.... which I LOVE! These guys rock!!"
0,"First time coming in with my husband and we both agreed it was worth a shot. The minute we walked in, it was pretty empty and my husband and I waited by the door. I assumed it would be like other restaurants to wait to get seated. And I was wrong. We waited 20 minutes before a worker finally acknowledged us. Keep in mind, it was pretty empty in there with 5 workers just walking around. He let us know we can sit anywhere. At that point my husband was irritated and we just left. Service was not great. Never coming back."
1,"Great lunch specials, rivaled only by Venezia's pizza. This is however Chicago style pizza."
1,"First off - this place is definitely NOT closed, we just went there yesterday.  Second, it's cash only.  Third, you should definitely hit up an ATM and go because it's delicious and run by very inviting and friendly people who seem to take great pride in their work!  We had the Ox Tail and Chicken Stir Fry.  The Ox Tail was extremely good, I'd never had it before and although the idea kinda tweaked with me a little I gave it a try and successfully ignored the weirdness factor until it was well established in my brain that I loved this dish! ;)  My wife got the chicken stir fry and loved it (I tried a small bite or two and confirm it was very good.)  We also got a special home-made Jamaican drink which I can't pronounce (but it was good) and a slice of rum cake to-go (my **favorite** of all the cakes!)  All in all we both filled up on a great meal and took home enough for a good sized lunch!  We'll absolutely be back!"
1,"Really good, perfect balance quality price. The portions are big and everything is very tasty. I was amazed by the spring rolls, that means something. I found the Pho (soups) to be ok, nothing particularly amazing but still quite satisfying. Do yourself a favor, take a bubble tea, best I've had."

1,"Take two food items which are awesome at anytime of day and build a restaurant around them and this is what you get. I don't think i could eat this fare everyday but when you're in the mood, boy does it hit the spot. The service is very good and the premises is well maintained.  The only negative thing i can say is that they serve pepsi rather than coke."

0,"I have to say I was not impressed with this place at all.  It has a good gimmick.  When entering there is a huge sign on the door stating cash only and you are reminded of this by the nurse who is positioned behind  a glass wall. She kindly reminds you that it is cash only and they have an ATM if you need it.  All \""patients\"" must wear a hospital gown. \nWe were sat near the paddle station but sadly positioned so we really couldn't see what was really happening except the beatings. :) (You are beaten if you don't finish your food.  in reality, you have to buy one of their souvenir paddles.). \n\nIt took a bit for our waitress to come over to us to place our orders.  There really isn't much variety on the menu, it is a burger or a chili hot dog.  I got a single burger and my husband order the chili dog with fries.  The burger was bland even with chili on it and the fries were just soggy not crisp at all.  My husband's chili dog didn't have enough chili on it to cover the whole thing. Oh, and you can't just order a glass of water, you have to pay for bottled water and the Coca Cola bottles are the smaller kind.  Paying $3 a pop was not pleasant. \n\nWe were entertained while we ate as several tourists were being \""spanked\"" but all in all the place is not worth a repeat.  Food was eh, service was eh, and the prices were eh."

Daniel Bouloud for a meal... or just enjoy the general casino area..  \n\nThe rooms are sweet.."
0,"I came here for breakfast, mainly because we had 2 complimentary buffet tickets as part of staying at New York New York, and MGM was just a bridge walk across the street. We arrived a little before 11 AM on Saturday morning and didn't have to wait all that long to get in - after getting through the first line (for the register) and the second line (waiting to get seated), we probably were all seated within 10 minutes. Since you serve yourself, there's not much to discuss in that arena, although the waitresses are very keen on refilling your champagne glasses without even asking if you want more...I would imagine it's quite easy to get yourself quite loaded before the morning is even out.\n\nAs for the food - most of it is standard brunch fare, but a great deal of it isn't all that fresh. The bacon was all over the map -  some pieces were too chewy, other pieces were overly crisp. Scrambled eggs were okay, if not terribly fluffy given how long they were sitting there. While I liked the flavor of the corned beef hash, it was way too dry. The tiny biscuits were good, but again - some were too dried out from sitting under hot lights for who knows how long. The spicy Polish sausage was probably the best thing I ate here, but that's not saying much - I've had better (and fresher) sausage elsewhere.\n\nIf you get your meal comped, you may as well show up. Otherwise, I'd probably stick with seeing what a traditional breakfast joint in Vegas would be like. If anything, it reminds me of why I haven't been at buffets in a long time (aside from encouraging me to stuff my face more than I should)."
1,Place is super clean and great customer service!! I think the guys who serve it are the owners because they do a great job at representing the place.  The yogurt is good but the toppings are even better.  By this I mean the fruit is always fresh and I'm pretty sure the use name brand candies because it tastes better then generic stuff.
0,"The only thing good about this place is the fortune cookies and the free entrees you win when opening. \nFirst time visiter: Started out by walking in on a Saturday night and the place was dead. That was a bad sign. Placed our \""take out\"" order (large teriyaki chicken, small honey chicken, and a kids meal) $23 total! We were really excited about eating some fresher food than the nearby Panda Express. Took a long time to get our food and when we got it we were missing our spring rolls. The manager gave us a $7 off our next visit. \nGot home, and the small entree was THE SAME SIZE AS THE KIDS MEAL. There was NO flavor in the dishes. My 10 year old daughter couldn't even eat her meal cause she was so disgusted. It tasted like those frozen Chinese dinners that you buy at the grocery store. Kids meal had probably like 5 pieces and the small entree had the same amount. They were like chicken fingers from the freezer. I was so disappointed and will ONLY go back one other time cause of the $7 coupon, and the free entree fortune that came in my cookie. \nThis place will be gone in a few months."
0,"For some reason all the other Indian restaurants are closed on Monday, and since I had a hankering for Indian food, I checked up coriander's website and saw that it was open till 10 pm , since it was already 9:25 I called them up to ask if they would still serve us and upon receiving an affirmation we made a reservation reached there 10 minutes later. Upon reaching the ma\u00eetre d' seats us. \nThis is when things start going wrong, the owner turns up and refuses to serve us, we actually had to get up from our seat. When the owner left the ma\u00eetre d' offered to take order for a take away and then tried to push drinks on us ( not free, and no discount either).While we were waiting another person from the establishment suggested that we were pretty lucky that they were taking our order for a take away.\nThe food was pretty average, with the chicken chettinad tasting nothing like a chicken chettinad.\nSo to sum up if you wish to eat average Indian food and not feel welcome, Coriander India Grill is the place to be"
1,"The food was very good and service great. The portions are not small at all from their appetizers, sandwiches or plates. They have a nice variety too."
1,"So glad there is a new fantastic place in my neighborhood to frequent. Fantastic service, lovely people, delicious things to linger over in the shop or take home, I am so pleased such a place exists! Far more charm/personality and life than across the street at Starbucks...\n\nBrought a friend for lunch and she loved it as well. Also, the BEST baguettes for miles ;) Will 100% be a repeat customer!"
1,"This location gets super busy for lunch.  Stay at home mom's galore with their giant strollers!  Even if it's really busy, you usually don't wait for longer than 10 minutes.  They also have bar seating, which is usually empty.  The service is hit or miss.  This is a common lunch spot for my coworkers and I so we go here a lot.  Sometimes the service is fast, and sometimes it's slower than watching paint dry.  \n\nThe food usually comes out in a reasonable time, so that's not what I'm talking about when I say slow.  What I mean is that the server will forget to refill your drinks, or will take forever to bring you your check, or take forever to bring you back your check to sign.  \n\nThe food overall is good.  I've never had anything here I didn't like, but it's not spectacular or anything.  It's a great little lunch spot and other than the occasional slow service, there are no complaints."
0,"Don't tell me the delivery will be 45min - 1hr if it's going to be 1.5hr. Now 4 people have missed their lunch hour and will have to wait hours to eat the cold delivery. \n\nDon't ask me on the phone if I'm paying in cash, not tell me the total, then NOT give your driver any change. Are you effing kidding me? he's 30 min late instead of telling me $40 is ok instead of $42, he tells ME to go ask coworkers for $3 since he can't break a $20. NO APOLOGY OR explanation for the lateness. \n\nWorst customer service, never ordering again. I signed up for yelp just to write this I'm so irritated."
0,"This is part of a small chain, based in Miami Beach.  I had lunch here.  Service was inconsistent.  The initial greeting was friendly, and I was seated quickly.  Water was quickly offered, and a very good bread basket arrived shortly thereafter.  However, the server took a long time to bring me a menu, and seemed in a hurry.  This slow-to-return then in-a-hurry attitude would recur.  Oh yeah, I was never even offered dessert, just handed the check.  Isn't this place famous for its key lime pie?\n\nI had never had stone crabs, so I gave them a try as an appetizer.  They were OK, but I guess I'm not a fan.  Also, I thought Joe's was known for its mustard sauce.  None was provided.  One nice touch: after I was finished, an assistant came by with a lemon, and squeezed the juice over my hands into a waiting bowl.  He then gave me a hot, wet towel.  Much appreciated.\n\nI had glazed black cod as an entree.  It was a big piece of wonderfully moist, flaky fish.  The glaze was excellent.  A trifle sweet, it began to cloy after a few bites.  Not to worry - half a lemon was provided; the juice made the sauce perfect.  On the other hand, I could have done without the pedestrian French fried sweet potatoes."
0,doesn't deserve a star..not a great Insurance group.don't bother signing up I was a member for 2 years then what did u guys do I got laid off and denied my claim...don't waste your money.
1,Boba and donuts..great combo. The donuts are awesome. Moist and delicious.
0,"Worst experience ever.....: I ask for a jersey and get told \""not gonna happen\"" and then ignored after that........ Never coming back with your poor customer service poor selection."
1,Have eaten at the Jade Palace several times this past winter. Always excellent service and food. It gets busy on the weekends so plan ahead.
0,"I'm really disappointed in this place. I went on a Tuesday and my waitress was slow and dis organizationed, but that was not the reason for my bad review.  It was the food. It was just bad. We started with brushetta. Kinda tastless. Dry toast with tomatoes covered in cheese. Then dinner; I had the lasagna.  Mostly bland sauce and noodles,  some sausage and a touch of ricotta cheese, clearly a couple of days old reheated with cheap mozzarella cheese on top. Asked for bread, it was re heated to ye point it was burnt and dry. My dates food was just as bad...."
1,"I would of given it 5 stars, but the 20 dollars a day resort fee was made me minus 1 star.  \n\nThis place is beyond amazing. I loved everything about our suite. Its beautiful, clean, and really stylish. The walk to the MGM Grand is a wee bit tooo far, but I didnt mind it too much.  My boyfriend and I definitely utilized the fully stocked kitchen to reheat our left overs from dinner the previous night. When youre in Vegas, there isnt a point to take home left overs, but with this amazing in suite kitchen, we were allowed too. We didnt have to buy lunch the next day! \n\nStaff is extreamly friendly and helpful. Nothing bag to say about this place, other than that dumb resort fee!"
0,Whoever manages this joke of an airport should be fired for their incompetence. If they aren't incompetent they are willfully negligent. Flying air canada for the past five years and more to pass to the US is a joke. Terrible signage. Security guards and baggage people telling you to pick up your bags and go thru customs; the airline telling you don't have to. Miscommunication; misinformation. Long lines. Staff who couldn't care less. No food stores to buy food for my son for the connecting flight (in the rare instances when I do make my connection thru the nightmare transfer system). It's like they are trying to punish anyone flying from another country or Canada to the US. It's almost as if whoever runs this place have no experience running anything except a poutine stand.
1,"Montreal has good beer, and this was a good place to start."
1,"Just had dinner at Angry Crab for the first time and loved it!   Our server Noel was awesome.  He talked us through the menu and explained everything.  We went with a $20 deal that included 1/2 lb each of king crab knuckles, Dungeness crab, crawfish and vegetables.   We also ordered another bag with blue crab.  Just an FYI: this stuff is spicy!  I love spicy food and ordered a 3 and 4 and wished that I had gone with a 2 at least!  My mouth was on fire!\n\nNoel was amazing.  Constantly checked on us. Brought everything out quickly and cleared the table as we ate.  Even brought crayons out for the kids to draw on the butcher paper table covering.  He really made our first experience at Angry Crab something to remember.   Super friendly and extremely knowledgable about the menu.  Steered us toward ordering the right things for our tastes.   \n\nThe only reason this place got 4 stars and not 5 was the value.  It's a bit expensive for what you get, but definitely delicious!\n\nA couple of tips:\n\nThis is a meal where you will literally get your hands dirty.  Don't be shy about wearing the plastic bibs.  You will definitely need it!\n\nThe French fries are delicious and help if your mouth is on fire from the spicy food.  \n\nNot a first date place.   No plates or utensils so you will be using your hands to eat and the entire table is your plate.  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  \n\n\nSay hi to Noel if you go in. Enjoy the laid back atmosphere and be prepared for a unique experience!"
0,"There are so many clues here, where do I begin? Well, uh first off I don't do AYCE sushi because of this very reason, IT'S NEVER FRESH! Korean marinated sushi is what it is. Secondly, the name says it's all, when it called a \""Japanese and Korean BBQ restaurant\"", an third, like the others yelpers said, the place was dead. All of these signs, yet I still decided to let my friend talk me into eating with her here. \n\nLiterally 4 other people when we came here at 8:00pm, we were sat at the bar and presented the AYCE menu, which always baffles me, let's see how many rolls we can change the name of and trick the white person. My first roll was not good, so I gave them a second chance and ordered something else, which of course tastes the same but the salmon on top looked old and dry. By this time I had lost my appetite, it is then you make the decision to waste $30 on dinner and call it a loss or chance getting sick on sub par, not sushi grade fish.  I called it a loss. \n\nThe waitress that came to refill my tea kept sniffling, and then I saw here wipe her nose with her hand and then go in the back, come out and do the same, I know she didn't wash her hands. Then proceed to lean over me and do the same. At this point I'm pissed because this is not only common sense, but clearly rude and not hygienic. \n\nNo way would I return or recommend this dump."
0,"I went here on Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner. The waitress was so nice, very helpful and very knowledgable. We had a big party and people trickled in slowly and she didn't seem to mind. Everyone ordered and the food did take awhile to come, but that wasn't a big deal.  We were going out drinking after this, so I ordered the burger. I know places like this tend to serve small plates, so something greasy and filling seemed like a better idea. I ordered my burger meduim. When it came, it was well done and so dry I couldn't eat it. It was served on a large ciabatta bread, and the burger was tiny compared to the bread. It was very disappointing. The fries were okay, though some were covered in chili powder. So the food was disappointing but the atmosphere was nice and the company was great, so it wasn't a total loss. Then it was time for the bill. The waitress kindly split the check, and a gratuity was added automatically due to our party size. Everyone but myself and another person paid with a card. Our bills were about $30 with tip included. We both left two twenty dollar bills. The waitress dropped off everyone's cards very quickly and then said, \""Have a great night,\"" and disappeared. At first we gave her the benefit of the doubt, \""Oh maybe she does cards separaetly from cash and she'll come back with our change.\"" She never came back with our change. We tried to find her, but we couldn't see her anywhere. We had another reservation so we couldn't stay and complain, so we just left without making a big fuss. I was completely floored by someone being that presumptuous and giving herself that huge of a tip. She essentially gave herself a $15 tip on a $25 bill twice. I will never go back to this place. The food is fancy but isn't worth the price. And I will never go somewhere that steals from me so blatantly."
1,"It's one of the best cup of coffee in Phoenix, if not the best.   Their coffee is always fresh and DELISH.  They have some very tasty baked goods as well.  Their lemon bars are fantastic, sweetness with a lot of tartness = yumfest!  \n\nSure, they seem to be busy all of the time but there is always room for a few more people.  The layout at Lux is surprisingly more spacious than what most people think.  \n\nThis is a great place to meet up with some friends over some fantastic coffee and some goo eats!  Looking forward to seeing you there!"
1,"We had a GREAT time with Andrew (our host/promoter) on the VIP UNLTD club crawl! There was a group of 5 of us (3 guys, 2 girls) and this was my first club crawl experience. What a solid introduction! \n\nWe snagged a deal for this crawl from Yipits and we couldn't pass it up. The price was too good!\n\nMy group showed up at around 10:15 pm at the Evening Call at Mandalay Bay for check in, but right before that Andrew texted me, asking if we were on our way, and he was willing to wait for us since we were running a little late. Upon arrival he was really friendly and funny as HELL! Definitely provided us with laughs and good conversation the whole night. He also provided us with several rounds of shots between stops. Pretty dope. \n\nThe venues were NICE! We hit up Light, Mix, and the Foundation Room, which are all inside Mandalay Bay. The final stop was LAX inside Luxor. They were all nice and super fun, especially FR and LAX because they had a nice mix of EDM as well as radio songs/hip- hop. Overall we were satisfied though. We never waited in line more than maybe 3-5 mins and everything went smoothly. Each stop was roughly an hour. \n\nI'd totally do a crawl with Andrew and VIP UNLTD again! I look forward to another in depth discussion about hip hop with him, haha! Good times!"
1,"This place is ree-diculous, and I mean that in a good way. A month or so ago, I pulled into the parking lot to go to Milagro Grill and spotted Nothing Bundt Cakes. I said very loudly, \""Oh my god!\"" To which my daughter replied, what's wrong mommy? I told her I saw my favorite place in the world for sweets. And that is not an understatement. I first tried this place in north Scottsdale and the Arcadia location has the same great quality. Moist cakes with a variety of flavors and sizes. I especially like the samples they have at the front. Just the other day, I tried an awesome cinnamon swirl sample. Delicious. \n\nOn a recent evening, we had dinner at Milagro and went here to get me some dessert. On the exact minute they were closed, we were at the door. I almost had a heart attack that I was here and couldn't get my fix. The employees didn't hesitate to let us in which was so cool. My husband picked up a red velvet cake ($19 serves 8-10 ppl) and it was hit. The red velvet is my favorite with the cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips in the batter. I typically get the bundlet which is about $4. \n\nI pretty much need to stay away from this area because otherwise I will pig out on their delicious goodies....."
0,Terrible service.  NOT kid friendly.  Restaurant should be ashamed of themselves for the way they treat customers. I was with the Vivianna and could not believe the service we received. Will never return to this restaurant and want to the restaurant across the street that was packed. No wonder this restaurant was empty.
0,Looking through yelp someone posted a picture of the prices which is not current. Today we went for brunch and with the B connected card it's actually $16.99 instead of $13.99. Regular price is 21.99. The b connected card applies for 2 guests so since there were 3 of us 2 of us ate for $16.99 and the third person was $21.99.\nAsked for a high chair for my toddler (didn't have to pay for) they brought a highchair that was filthy with old food glued to it. So disgusting. Requested another highchair which was clean.\nFood: was OK I was disappointed but my husband enjoyed it.  A lot of variety especially in the desserts section it was overwhelming but out of the 4 desserts that we sampled the pecan bar was the best. Overall food lacked flavor not worth the $ go elsewhere.
0,"I stayed at the SLS during opening weekend and everything was fantastic but this place is a FAIL! Although the service is excellent and they are open late (which is perfect for those late night noodle cravings) the food is just not good, in fact its horrible.  Go to the Griddle next door instead, you won't be disappointed."
0,This wasnt bad pizza. I just lived in a city with a really great pizza culture.. so i was really let down when i moved back home. This wasn't  horrible this wasn't great ... is was just okay . \nTHe garlic knots .. just okay .. and the wings ... and service was meh
0,"2 stars here at Yelp is \""Meh. I've experienced better\"".\nAnd that is exactly right. The Spaghetti with Kobe meatballs was absolutely bland with tomato sauce straight out of the 55 gal barrel.  The steak was decent however, once you scraped off the burned exterior... come on guys, you don't serve burned steaks an hour after appetizer.\nAppetizer was a pasta fagioli soup... meh. \n\nThe sommelier and his wine choice was a bright spot. Picked us a nice Super Tuscan for a relatively cheap $100 per bottle (this is vegas).\nI've enjoyed meals at Pasta Pomodoro for infinitely less."
1,"Dressler's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Amazing food, friendly staff, and wonderful service.  It's an upscale restaurant with a friendly down home kind of feel.  In fact the owner, Jon even came by our table last time I was there to introduce himself.  You won't find that at too many upscale restaurants.  If you're looking for great food and welcoming atmosphere I would recommend that you definitely check out Dressler's!"
0,"I sometimes wonder if I should bring a bloodhound with me to the store so that I can have it find an employee. Then again, when I do find the employee they take me to the empty shelf. Except for one cashier, they seem unable to converse in English in even the simplest and rudimentary fashions (like Thank You or Good Day). Recently they moved things around in some parts of the store, so now you have to hunt for what used to be familiar. Pulled out the Harvey's and replaced it with Subway, so now you can have a bread sandwich after you finish your hunt for products.\n\nBought a bicycle rack here that wasn't made to actually hold a bicycle. Their own brand (Husky). I don't know which is sadder, the fact that the metal for the bicycle rack is completely contorted, or the fact that the wood rail has the edges lifted off. The bicycle rack that I do want is listed on their website as \""not in stock\"". Big shocker. Seriously, how hard is it to track the SKUs that you sell by computer? Isn't that the point of an inventory system? Maybe I would save time by driving the extra 4km to the competitors store instead of stopping here in hopes of finding products on the shelves!\n\nOnly good change, you can now get your receipt in email. It's a miracle! Now, if I could only find things to buy in the store instead of empty shelves and excuses."
0,"I went to Streetcar Po-Boys fully intent on enjoying an authentic Louisiana po-boy.  The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They're located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.\nThe menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic.\nBut here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.\nThe food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the \""Ragin Cajun,\"" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed \""meat,\"" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \""meat.\""  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.\n\nOverall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death."
1,"This place is absolutely amazing! If you're looking for tasty, authentic Indian cuisine this is the place to try. We had the chicken tikka masala which was amazing, the salad with tandoori chicken, na'an bread and the chicken tandoori. Every single dish was absolutely amazing, the whole family agreed on 5 stars. There were multiple people coming around to refill drinks and get you anything else you may need, the owner came by multiple times to make sure everything was great, just as he promised it would be. This is a must try for people just visting from out of town or the locals, just east of the strip (Las Vegas Blvd)."
0,"DO NOT listen to any of the promoters for this club. They lie and lie and lie. Ours promised us bottle service for a certain price and then totally took it back and tried to make us pay up once he got us inside. SUPER SNEAKY LIARS!!\n\nWhen they relized we couldn't pay up they had security escort us out the back side of the club down a dark hallway and we ended up by a kitchen and by the freight elevators...it was so bizarre and then we got tagged like under 18 years old at a 21+ place with X's on our hands. All our our friends were super dressed up, we had 50/50 girls to boys ratio....it was BS."
1,I really like Thai food and I really like this restaurant. Lunch is a great value since you automatically get soup and spring roll with your order. I love the Pad See Ew and the curry dishes. Nice decor and speedy service.
1,"Great lunch, great people, fantastic place to eat.  Make sure to check yelp for the free appetizer."
1,"I celebrated my birthday and my friend's together on a Saturday definitely had a blast!! Everyone was great as far as customer service from the front door to the bathroom lady to the other people partying. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I requested one song yes ghetto (Young Money - Tapout ) but never heard it and I tipped the DJ like 60$ yikes lol First time buying a bottle and it was worth every penny \""the confetti\"" was just baller!!"
0,I must express my utter distain for the way my family and I were treated when we entered the restaurant and refused entry because of our baby. We double checked Resto-Mtl and the Facebook page and there was no indication that it was a exclusively a bar (which does not allow children) and not a resto-bar which does. The hostess was rude and did not show any empathy for the fact that we had drove over an hour to eat at this venue because until now had heard good things. I'm sorry but as a result I strongly do not recommend this restaurant to my friends and family and to other people with small children including newborns. If possible I would give it zero stars.
1,"Plenty of parking, not crowded at all! I was amazed at how sparkly clean the bathroom was! I really enjoyed my time here, and I learned a lot about all the different animals and cacti, from reading all of the informative signs. Who knew how interesting these things can be!?! Definitely will be back!"
1,"I've been waiting for a place like this to open up since freshman year!! (For reference, I am now a senior, kind of, graduated early.)\n\nAnyway, sample the flavor before you commit. Not every one is for everyone. Ask for a sample cup, you won't regret doing this.\n\nThat being said, personal favorites are Honeydew (best Honeydew I've had to date even compared to places in Cali. The flavor itself is rare too.) and Mango.\n\nSide note: The green tea was nasty (way too tart, not enough green tea flavor). If you're like me and looking for an almost too bitter matcha heavy green tea experience, this isn't the place to get it. Hence, the sampling step.\n\nDespite that, a ton of fruit topping choices and mochi is available as well. All I need to be happy. Makes stressful semesters a little more bearable.\n\nBonus: Before this place became uber popular, I had a pleasant conversation with the owners. Definitely a nice mom and pop place to support, though they probably don't need help spreading the word at this point!"
1,Looks can be decieving!  It looks like a boba/bubble/tapioca drink place but it is much more.  It is asian style cafe where they cater to both the togo drink customers and in-store dinning.  We were with a Tawainese friend who ordered for us.  Everyone really enjoyed the food.  Everything was delicious and pretty authentic for Mesa/Phoenix area.  I wish they had heavier hand with the spicies to really make the flavors stand out more.  I would come back.
0,"Mustang Sally's used to be a nice dinner, with the 50's or 60's atmosphere. It has changed so much, with a look of barely alive, trying to look like a  Star Bucks dinner, yet falling short of that mark. The counter where the cash register used to be is dusty and it looks like it is basically ready to close down. The people that wait on you are not trained for a restaurant, but simply order takers that act like they don't want to be there. Another nice place gone away; it is too bad."
0,"Not good.\n\nFirst, beware of the scammer who's gonna greet you and ask you if you were interested in fixing \""the chips' on your windshield.\n\nThen, are you interested in paying +$15 for a car wash that doesn't bother cleaning your cup holder or empty your car's ashtray?\n\nLastly, even their express car wash machine is terrible. It left deep scratches and swirls on my car.\n\nThe owners should save their dignity and close this place or consider giving customers better service."
0,"Large variety, poor quality. There's nothing here I've tried that wasn't a huge let down. The food is bland, leaves plenty to be desired. I've tried the spring rolls, they are too big and not crisped, the pad thai, green curry, potato curry, and fried rice. Everything smells better than it tastes. The only positive is that they delivers and they take online orders through GrubHub."
1,"Everything was prepared fresh and the  shawarma and gyros were tender and flavorful. The grape leaves are the best I've ever had. However, the grilled chicken was rather dry but beautifully presented. The yoghurt is the best in town!! Make sure you order the fresh lemonade with mint, perfect for summer. Overall, homemade Mediterranean, so healthy!!"
1,"i dont eat the burritos here. i'm that annoying person who gets the same thing every time (chicken nachos) --- but why fix something that isn't broken?! yes, the caloric level is ridiculous... i even took off a star for it. but its cheap. and good. and reminds me of college."
1,"You cannot beat this hotel's accomodations and location for the price. I stayed for 3 nights at a rate of $41 per night. My room was clean and orderly. Television, internet connection, fridge worked. The rooms were fairly up to date.  I liked how they tried to be classy and equip the rooms with two mediocre bathrobes. I enjoyed the heated pool in the mornings, along with the bird chirping going on from the large bird cage nestled in the courtyard."
0,It's ok... very cheap at $20 for two entrees at lunchtime but ingredients clearly not fresh or best quality. Also a bad smell in men's toilets.
0,"Service would normally be better here, but our server was either a bit confused or couldn't hear us? We had some problems communicating with him sometimes.\n\nThe mussels were good, and the desserts we had were good as well.\n\nThe seafood salad was very bland, and the cioppino was just okay.\n\nAll in all, we wouldn't jump to return."
0,This is the second time I've seen KA and sadly they totally changed the ending of the show! Yes they had a major accident last year with the death of a cast member. But as many yelpers have mentioned they literally took out the best scene in the entire show and replaced it with some cheap blurry CGI wannabe fight scene! I mean cmon isn't this suppose to be Vegas?? Go BIG OR GO HOME! The show also seemed to lack that energy level I remember when they first opened. Maybe they've lost that passion after performing for so long. Yes i was literally falling asleep instead of staying engaged during our show. \n\nKnowing the and personally knowing and meeting the original caste members they would definitely be disappointed in what the show has turned into.\n\nAnyway for those considering seeing this show i would say save your money or at least do NOT pay full price and use those deal sites or book through mlife. You will be disappointed if you pay for this one.
0,"We have been a few times. Usually they were fun. Our most recent time I spent 50 minutes in line waiting to place our order then 20 minutes for our food. Once we ate our toddler was ready to go,  I spent all my time in line and waiting, it was a disappointing family outing. Perhaps they can figure out a way to expedite the service."
0,"Went to San Felipe's Cantina on the 4th of July.  Their Chips and Salsa are excellent!! I had the grilled Fish Tacos and they were very dry.  My server  was good as well.  The reason for the one star is that the AC was out and according to our server it had been out for much of the day.  We were not informed of this until after we were sat and ordered a drink and dinner.  As you can imagine we were miserable and just wanted to eat as fast as we could, get out and cool down."
0,"Went there for lunch time. I think they didn't like to serve us at all. They jus put the plate on the table and walked away without asking anything ok for u guys or u need anything else. Brought out the drink without the straw . When we asked for that, they jus like ok don't ask anything anymore. Made me so uncomfortable on that day. I will never come back to that anymore."
1,"New to the area, my husband and I have already hit the highest rated sushi places in Pittsburgh. And while many were good, this BY FAR is the very BEST we have had!\n\nNewly opened, the restaurant is a good space. The front room looks small, but there's another dining area in the back. It was quiet when we came--a Monday night before the dinner rush. We were seated, given water and menus, and had our order taken fairly quickly. Miso soup came out right away.\n\nWe ordered the spicy tuna roll, the yellow tail roll and the hibachi chicken entree. Both rolls came out together and let me say: the fish is incredibly fresh! The sushi was absolutely delicious. We were so happy with it, we wanted to order more rolls just to take home with us. Luckily we didn't, because we ate the entire hibachi chicken entree. Cleaned the plate, it was so good. The staff was friendly, and the owner came around and asked us, and all the other diners, how our dinner was.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the owner brought us our check and gave us each a Hello Kitty chocolate marshmallow. It might sound odd to mention it, but to us, it was a sign that the owner really cared about his customers. He wanted to make a lasting good impression. Well, he did. We plan on returning frequently."
0,Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.
1,"This is one of those places that is too big for its own boots. It is no secret that this place is good. Often during dinner service there is a wait to get in here. The quality is there. The seating is European style. Meaning you could be at a table close to someone else. [I like this style, it makes some uncomfortable but get over it] The food is good. The only thing I've been slightly annoyed with the service, is that at lunch time they have a pizza buffet, which the server never mentioned to my group. The buffet is cheaper than a single pizza. \n\nCONS: \nThe bar area really isn't defined. There can be issues if you are sitting near the bar and people try to participate in the bar at a second level deep. This is more of a staff deal [which should stop that]\n\nGiven that, I would go back here. The food is good, the combinations of the pizzas are unique. \n\n[ BTW This place is owned by the same group that owns Flying Biscuit and Monkey Joes in charlotte]"
1,"I finally got to try the famous dumplings! Having heard from some friends who love this place and read very good reviews on Yelp, I eventually bought this Russian dumpling. It was one bad day for me as I just had to pay a lot for my new macbook battery but the dumplings had really made my day! The dumpling is tiny but tasty. I usually have Chinese dumpling but this one tastes different. If you happen to be in the downtown, this place deserves your attention! The owner is easy to talk to. And the good news is that I live so close so I know I will be their regular :)"
1,"When it comes to cheap lunches on the westside of town, nothing beats Thai BBQ on Jones. Many a time have coworkers and I stopped in for a great meal on the cheap. \n\nHave tried it a few times outside of lunch which just means the portions are a little larger and prices higher but still great Thai food. Oh... and the service is awesome! \n\nThe only thing I have against this place is their water tastes weird to me, but things like hot tea or ice in my sprite are all good. Odd.... Maybe it is just me."
1,"Always had good, fresh food and friendly service. Their chicken tacos are some of the best I have ever had, and I will always be a customer because one time I ordered but had lost my debit card, and they still fed me and just told  me to come back the next day and pay. There are not many resteraunts or businesses that will do that anymore, and I was impressed.\n\nThey also make a pretty good torta and the carne asada is pretty good. \n\nCheap, fast, and yummy...."
0,"STOP.  Please just stop.  That is not a uniform.  That is a swimsuit.  It would also help that the \""girls\"" looked good in them.\nCan we have a classy place please!  This isn't fooling anyone.  It is barely dressed college girls (which does sound good on the surface) but they are all suffering from the freshman 40 (lbs).\n\nI never thought a place could make Hooters look good... but they do.\n\nAwful location too.. but that might soften the blow when you never hear about the place.\n\n\nRe:Review/Edit\nYeah it is funny that someone could give it 5 stars and it doesnt open until today.  Odd how it sounds more like a commercial then reality.  And yes... BINGO you nailed it \""Friends and Family\"".  I gave my honest opinion.  Obviously you as... let me guess manager? didn't like it.  Tough, you earned it."
1,"Superior customer service is hard to come by in fast food establishments. This Rubios is absolutely fantastic. The woman operating the register, Marina was wonderful. Always smiling and keeping busy. As a good employee should do. I would hire her in a heartbeat. Keep up the great work at this location guys."
1,"I ordered the lamb burger rare. The waitress took the order as if all ok... then I get my burger, and its cooked medium well!! I sent it back. She came back with the manager saying they can only do medium rare+ for lamb. I said that's fine and to make that. The waitress later applogized saying she is new and didn't know... but still, the chef knew, so how come they didn't ask me when they got the order.\nAnyway, the chef delivered the 2nd burger. And the manager checked up on me twice.  It was very good the 2nd time around.\nI also ordered the jalapeno poppers... they were good, but only 3 come!! (they are real and hand made).\nAlso got the Nutjob shake.... Omg, best shake I have EVER HAD!!!!!!  Everybody at my table tried it, we all fell in love with it. soooo good. I highly recommend the Nutjob shake!!! \nIm giving this place an extra star just for the great shake."
0,"Je suis all\u00e9e 2 fois au Mr B, la premi\u00e8re fois ce fut une belle exp\u00e9rience le tartare de Saumon est d\u00e9licieux! Le restaurant est tr\u00e8s petit nous \u00e9tions assis juste a cote de la cuisine il fessait chaud.

0,"THIEVES! Do not pay with a credit card here! My co-worker and I ate here one day, and her husband the day before, and ALL THREE of our credit card numbers were stolen and fraudulently used. This restaurant was the only common denominator between the three of us. Unbelievable."
1,"Great Bar!  Do not confuse with Bostons Gourmet Pizza.  Much different and better - excellent bar food, lots of quality TVs, satellite and a staff that gets them to all the events.  Lowest tab you are likely to find and good but fun trivia competition.  Try this place!"
0,"I had very limited choices here in this plaza when my friend wanted to stop at El Pollo Loco (which I won't eat). It was that, Subway or Qdoba. \n\nHaving had good experiences with Qdoba in Seattle/Bellevue, I figured I'd just give it a try. (I'm not much of a fan of Subway either, tbh.) \n\nI went in, walked up to the counter and waited... and waited more... About 5 minutes passed and I still haven't been served because the annoying employee is having social time with either a friend or obnoxious customer over at the register, babbling on and on about how he's in school and blahblahblah. 'Scuze me? A little service down here?\n\nOf course, after a few minutes I gave the employee the patented Condi Rice \""stink-eye\"", and I'm glad I did, because this place has a big ol' B grade for their health department grade. Ew.\n\nI did an about face and walked right out, wishing the next guy in line luck with actually getting some service. \n\nI'd give 0 if I could, but +1 stars because the ignorant, incompetent employee's behavior caused me to notice the B grade, and realize that I probably don't want to be eating at this location."
1,"I'm one lazy bitch. I have four bottles of moisturizer spread throughout my house. Why? So I don't have to go all the way to the bathroom to get it. Some days I sleep on my couch because my upright is laying on my bed and I don't have the strength to move it (but also because I have a tile floor and no hard case). I'm so lazy that I can't even be bothered to think of creative screen names. The URL for my yelp profile is the same one for my myspace, livejournal, and gmail. \n\nThey may even all have the same password, too, but I wouldn't know. I just check the \""remember me\"" box on all of them so I don't have to put in my info again when I sign back in. Fuck, what IS my password?\n\nI'm so lazy I can't even be trusted with simple tasks, like preparing my own lunch. \n\nFridays means I get out of work at 1pm, which means I have the house all to myself for a couple hours to play my upright bass as much and as loud as I want before other people start showing up and start demanding to able to hear the TV. Haters.\n\nAnyway. \n\nSo Fridays means getting takeout for lunch. Because I know that if I actually try to prepare a lunch at home, eventually I will get caught up in something else and bam, there goes my practice time until everyone goes back to bed. \n\nUsually \""practice day\"" means Dragon Garden Express, but on my way there I spotted Big Daddy's Frankfurters.\n\nThough I've known about Big Daddy's for years (how could I not? I live within walking distance), I've been hesitant to give them a try. Not just because hot dogs are the rat bastard of the meat community, but because with a name like Big Daddy's, deep down I expected to walk inside to be greeted by Danny DeVito's crazy sex offender third cousin who gives me a big smile and says \""Welcome to Big Daddy's! Whose your Daddy?!\""\n\nOh, hai, I'll get a chili cheese dog and a pillow to scream in.\n\nIn spite of these fears I bravely opened the door and stepped in to find a well-adjusted-looking gentleman sitting at the counter who perked up, literally jumping to his feet the moment I stepped in. Judging by the time of day I imagined business was slow. \n\nI ordered an all-beef dog and a bratwurst. Now, personally, I've never understood the \""all-beef\"" craze. While I applaud their honesty, I just think that it's a grim reminder of the reality we face with \""non-beef\"" dogs.\n\nA hot dog vendor saying \""Our dogs are made with 100 percent beef\"" gives me that same foreboding feeling that hearing the girl at Sephora say \""and the best part is, none of this stuff has been tested on helpless animals\"".\n\nAt Big Daddy's, every dog/sausage comes with four free toppings. I opted for cheese, relish, sauerkraut and grilled Italian onions (don't judge me). \n\nAs he fixed my lunch the man at the counter, who I'll assume is either Big Daddy or at the very least Large Uncle By Marriage, said \""Man, this stuff is going to get messy when you get it home, but boy will it be good\"".\n\nPersonally, I appreciate that level of honesty. I cannot begin to tell you how much less complicated my life would be if occasionally the girl at the Pane Bianco counter would say \""You're going to break your fork trying to cut these fresh tomatoes but they will be soooo juicy\"", or if the bartender would say \""you're going to ruin someone else's shirt later but this drink will be delish\"" when he handed me a hurricane.\n\nTo put a cherry on my sundae, he gave me a bag of chips \""on the house\"". Though to be honest I think it was more a manner of cleanliness than customer service. One, I didn't complain (surprisingly), and two, it was the last bag in the box. Either way, I was being undeservingly rewarded for trying a place out for the first time, and I liked it.\n\nI rushed home with my lunch in my passenger seat, wondering exactly what he meant by it would get messy. Perhaps the sauerkraut would crumble, or the onions would be greasy.\n\nImagine my surprise when I opened my little styrofoam box to find my frank and brat covered in cheese sauce. None of that mincy shredded cheese you get at Taco Bell. Cheese sauce, thick and gooey, like the kind you get at a concession stand or gas station.\n\nYou'd think that cheese sauce and sauerkraut would be gross. And by Eris, how you would be right. It was the nastiest, messiest frank and brat I've ever had, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy that, just a little. Okay, maybe more.\n\nMy poor choice of complimentary condiments aside, the franks themselves were amazing. They tasted like they just came off the grill, like the hot dog carts that hang outside of strip malls and Home Depots.\n\nBy the end of it my face was a train wreck, like a bulldog eating custard. I scraped off onions and cheese sauce from my lips and chin, realizing that while I may have had the perfect lunch, it cost me my dignity. Which is fine. I'm actually surprised I was able to trade it in for so much.\n\nThere was more I wanted to say, but I don't feel like typing it, so I guess I'll end it here.\n\nLe sigh."
0,"I am so dissapointed! \n\nIt started off good. I ordered 3 dishes from the menu they dropped off at my house ~2 months ago and the food was delivered in 20 minutes instead of the 45. I'm thinking 'OK, awesome', super fast delivery, the food is packaged in these neat snap-top plastic containers, everything is looking good! The portions were on the small side, but that is not unusual for delivery. \n\nHowever, there were a few big problems. The first was that the delivery guy was super rude, just grunted at me and shoved a receipt in my direction. The biggest problem was that the food was not good. Then to top it off,  the menu prices had all increased by at least 2 dollars in the last 2 months. I understand menu prices change, but 40$ for 3 dishes of Panda Express quality food.... Definitely will not eat here again.\n\n\nTofu Lovers- 3/10 \n-Most of the tofu was overcooked, the rest was UNDER cooked (how did they accomplish this???). The sauce was bland.\nSilver Noodles- 5/10\n-Noodles were over-cooked so they stuck together in a huge, dry clump. There were not enough vegetable for my liking. 5 or 6 broccoli florets and a handful of bean sprouts. The flavor was decent it was pleasantly spicy.\nDrunken Noodles w. Shrimp- 7/10\n-Shrimp was clean and cooked well and the sauce was flavorful."
1,"Friendly staff, love everyone but Sam was super helpful today! James is epic at nail art and French tips- highly recommend!"
1,Just had another great meal from Zaw's.  I have tried something different every time I've gone there and they do not disappoint.    \n\nI love Zaw's and will go back soon.
1,"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing about it!\n\nIn MY opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in terms of authenticity.  I know there are a lot of trendy mexican-fusion type joints but this is just your old fashioned get your grub on type Mexican.\n\n\nThe GOOD:  The salsa is very good...fresh ingredients give it a little bit of chunk and the flavor is perfect.  It is a little runny but I don't like salsa that has been thickened by paste or because it was pureed.  I would rather the flavor with chunks of onion and pieces of cilantro--and that is what this place offers.  \n\n\nThe BAD--They serve the salsa in a very small dish and they have a disclaimer on the menu that indicates only the first two rounds of chips and salsa are free.  I mean, what?  I understand we are in a tough economic situation but you can't be a mexican restaurant and charge for chips and salsa.  We have managed to avoid that extra charge so far.  We usually just ask a different person for more salsa every time...I know, a little dishonest, but I can't help it!  I expect a charge when you go to some random place and happen to order chips and salsa as your appetizer (like Chili's or something) but any standard, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place should NOT do such a thing.\n\n\n\nTHE EXCELLENT:  Their fresh, tableside guacamole!  WOW!  I had no idea avocados could have so much flavor.  It was fantastic.  The flavors were bold and boasted of fresh cilantro, onion, and lime!  It was such a perfect combination of flavors.  I have had it with the jalapenos and without...either way was incredible!  \n\n\n\nI typically get the veggie fajitas and that is another reason why I love this place.  TYPICALLY, if I order veggie fajitas I end up with onions and peppers marinated in salt.  Azteca sends out grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes, squash, broccoli and mushrooms.  They are not weighted down with sodium and dripping in a fajita sauce....they are grilled and fresh.  It really is perfectly done!\n\n\n\nThe beans and rice and pretty basic--nothing to speak about.  The flour tortillas are great and their pico de gallo is fresh and flavorful.\n\n\nOne other downfall is that they don't give you the option for black beans on the side.  But, what I found out is that black beans are not as authentic in terms of Mexican food.  Muy interesante!\n\n\n\nIt is definitely worth checking them out...even if it is just for their guacamole.  You may want to bring your own jar of salsa though....just kidding"
1,Ate here while on a visit back to PHX and glad to see this corner of 3rd st and Roosevelt getting a face lift.   Very open/comfortable space with good coffee and food.
1,"What a gem! The Spicy Miso here was freaking delicious and we loved that we found this place in Vegas.\nThe place was not busy at all, and it's not far from the strip! 5 minutes to get delicious ramen while on a Vegas trip?? Heck yeah!"
0,"I've been to quite a lot of Lee's Sandwishes in southern cal and this place was packed. I figured what can go wrong. I have to say my Banh Mi was really nasty (I didn't even finish it, it's that bad). I usually love any Vietnamese style coffee. I have no idea who made mine coffee, but the drink I got was the worst tasting drink I've ever had in the last 10 years. I had such a bad taste in my mouth I felt sick for the rest of the day. I had to buy bottle water just to rinse the taste out of my mouth."
0,Although they are courteous and thorough they are SLOW. You can hear people in the back having personal conversations while you sit and WAIT. My quoted half hour appointment took an hour and half. I waited a half hour before I was even seen initially.
1,"Mmmm... paper thin crust. Love the sausage with light sauce. I will warn you it is not very filling, but mighty tasty. Again, note they are only open Thursday through Sunday. Absolutely delicious pizza! We have ordered from here for  over 15 years. My wife and her family for over 20! As long as Johnnie is around, the quality and taste just can't be beat!"
1,Darn it i hate this place for being so far away from the house on a positive note wonderful and yummy i had the kimichi fried rice (raised on it so im slightly picky) was wonderful just the right amount of heat and the flavor was great prices low food quality high a place to come to
0,OMG... Why is every local Chinese place completely greasy & disgusting....EXCEPT   for the Panda on Rainbow near the Best Buy/ Home Depot?? I just can't get a decent meal!! \n\nGive me a Pei Wei!!! Give me a Pick up Stix. Please. :(
0,"The staff here for the most part are nice.  But some are real pieces of work.  I love the nail polish and hair product selections here and I like the variety of lines they carry.  The store is always bright and clean.  The hair salon in the back is also nice.  But I'm not too sure as to why I made an appointment when I had to wait over 45 minutes to get my hair cut, and that's not including the time I waited before hand.  I really wanted to give this place more than 2 stars but their staff needs to work on talking to customers and less with each other. Why am I sitting and waiting for so long and no one even looks at me, when I established I was here for a hair cut appointment?  It didn't help the situation at all and needless to say, I don't want to get my hair cut there again.\n\nKatrina is a very nice and wonderful stylist, who once she was finished with her prior customer was able to give me a hair cut that I wanted and took great care of me.  If you are going here for a hair cut, ask for her.  Just be mindful that the staff do not know how to book appointments correctly and there will be a wait."
1,Great salsa and chips! The atmosphere is a bit bright in the restaurant area. I like the shredded beef nachos a lot. Good margaritas too. The guacamole was a bit salty the two times we ordered it though.
0,Change is not good!  The special 777 changed for the worse. No more salad included. They now give you Broccoli instead of a dinner salad.  What the hell?   Why change an old school staple?  Every restaurant in the hotel is constantly changing and it's not for the better!
1,"I had a hankering for pasta and Lavo hit the spot. After parking in the Palazzo and trekking it to the Venetian, did I realize the Lavo is in the Palazzo.  My suggestion is park in the Palazzo and look for the signs showing guest registration and you will run into Lavo. They do accept reservations so call ahead especially on busy nights. \n\nAfter three weeks of low carbing, pasta was the only thing on my mind. With a plethora of Italian restaurants off the strip, out of all the reviews, Lavo seemed to fit.  I chose to sit out on the patio, despite being 10pm it was still a cool 93F outside. With EDM playing in the background and the glimmering lights from the strip, it gives Lavo a very trendy feel.  \n\nThey start you off with complimentary garlic bread wrapped in foil to keep it absolutely straight out of the oven warm. Paired with a red dipping sauce, it melted in my mouth. What was a portion intended for two people did not hold a chance once I began to devour the little bites of heaven. \n\nOn to the entree. Spaghetti carbonara had my name or should I say my stomach written all over it.  The plate looks deceptively small but once you dig in to the mound of pasta, you know you are gonna walk away satisfied with the portion. The spaghetti carbonara did not disappoint. It was rich in flavor and solid meal all around. It's not the best I have had but considering the location and the ambiance, Lavo definitely deserves 5 stars.  \n\nI finished the meal with a white chocolate breading pudding. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but wow, what a surprise. It wasn't overpowering or too sweet. It had all the warm elements of a bread pudding with a slight bitter but sweet white chocolate taste. I had had gone into carb heaven a almost went comatose. \n\nIf you are looking for a trendy Italian Las Vegas hot spot, Lavo will not disappoint."
1,"Love the atmosphere. What a cool find. Too bad about the loooong wait for food.\n\nWe heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on New Years Day after going to the dog park downtown. \n\nWe placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes. Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one, or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary, and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system. \n\nThe self seating system can be a little chaotic, and you may have to wait around for people to leave. Many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours. The patio is dog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs, but be warned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.\n\nWe polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant. It was perfect. My bloody mary was awesome too, brimming with garden goodness. My only complaint is they are damn expensive. $9. Kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.\n\nThe 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait. The staff apologized profusely for the delay. I guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly. Luckily we had the day off and no where else to go, so we didn't mind too much.\n\nMy hubby and I both had the egg sandwich, but mine without bacon. It was scrumptious. Every ingredient was top notch. My only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole. The problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion. I DESPISE raw onion. If I would have know I would have skipped the guac. May sound finicky but I scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before I ate it. \n\nWe also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum.\n\nThe staff is helpful, warm, and a lot of fun. Even with the raw onion issue, the expensive bloody mary, and the long wait for food, the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to sample the rest of the menu."
0,"Sorry to say but I will not be giving my business to TI in the future now that it is under new management.\n\nWhile there are great reviews about TI on Yelp, my experience leaves me rather disappointed. It should be noted that I visit Las Vegas regularly and I know what level of service to expect from a major resort.\n\nMy party and I arrived to find an hour long line at checkin which the hotel was not staffed properly for and when checking in, the hotel did not have the room type booked available and suggested that a rollaway cot can be delivered to the room in 60-90 minutes.\n\nThe mandatory resort fee included perks that simply weren't available such as VIP access to the Sirens show which I didn't care for it but don't advertise it as a perk if you are not prepared to deliver.\n\nOur original reservation had us staying two nights and when we decided to inquire whether a third night stay is possible and what rate would be extended to us, the reservation agent simply stated $199/night. Now, I have been in Vegas enough to know that rack rates are a bunch of bull, especially on a Sunday night during Christmas. I asked again if there is anything they could do on the rate and the agent again stated no.\n\nI took my business across the street to the Venetian at $208/night and if you have stayed at the Venetian, you know there's a world of difference there. Fast, courteous service from the Venetian but not TI."
0,"I don't think I have ever seen a more overrated place in my life and I have been to a number of hipster places in Chicago.\n\nFirst off, the people working at the actual restaurant location are a pretty inane lot forgetting they have you on hold or even not putting you on hold so you can hear their loud and annoying voices do other things.  One time I clearly stated my order with all the details needed (wheat pita etc.) and they still had to go through the litany of standard order questions.  It seriously came to the point where I did not eat here solely because I didn't want to go through the ordering process.\n\nHow's  the food?  Well it's obviously decent enough that I ate here multiple times despite the incompetence at the front desk.  They make good ingredients, in particular their hummus is really good.  Unfortunately, they can't make a sandwich worth a damn.  There is no balance to how the ingredients are arrayed in the sandwich with sauce maybe lightly coating the top or bottom if they are not passing it off in a side container.  Sometimes the chicken is cut up into manageable pieces, others you are left to rip the unwieldy pieces up yourself.  With my last visit the pita itself fell apart when I took it out of its box spraying toppings all over my floor.\n\nIf you want a good pita sandwich I recommend a place called New Amsterdam in Omaha, which is cheaper, better and gives you more food.  Basically the only thing Omaha has ever added to civilization.  Meanwhile I suggest you skip the Banzo cart and try the Thai cart or the Peruvian cart or the Indonesian cart where they are serving up something tastier and more unique."
1,"Best Italian Beef in town, as far as I'm concerned.\nAwesome fries - they're those lightly battered crispy fries.\nServe yourself soft drink refills (which is always a plus for me in a counter service place).\nI don't know what Skip B is talking about with regard to being dirty. I found this place exceptionally clean. Even the window sills were free from dust. As for the dining room being empty, they seem to have quite a bit of drive through traffic at lunch time. Besides my husband and myself, there were also four other tables full of guys - mainly construction/manual labor type guys.\n\nAll in all, it was exactly what I was looking for - a great beef sandwich in CU. YUM!"
1,The Best gyros in town being from Chicago I know what I am talking about \nTzatziki sauce needs to be thicker but tasty Prices are fair and service excellent  Give it a try you will enjoy
1,"Plus points for the open bar (maybe you had to pay for that? not sure since we got pretty hooked up). Negative points for not allowing beer included in the open bar. Lots of beautiful and fake bodies. Particularly the bartenders/cocktail waitresses who all had tall and incredibly toned bodies who catches everyone's eyes as they walk by. So you come here particularly for the crowd, as the music is simply ok, the area is very small as well as the one pool itself, and daybeds are limited."
0,"I stopped by on a day where they were having a test drive event along with free food like burgers and hot dogs.\n\nWhat a complete waste of time. They completely ignored me when I walked in. For the 15 minutes I was walking around and looking at the scooters, they didn't even bother to ask if I had any questions or if I wanted a test drive. They were more interested in talking to each other and their friends that were just there hanging out. \n\nI thought the idea of running a business is to make money. Perhaps I am sorely mistaken because it seems like they didn't want any customers bothering them during their conversations.\n\nWhen I decide to purchase a scooter, I will go look elsewhere even if I have to drive across town. I suggest you do the same and take heed of all the rest of the bad reviews for this \""business.\"""
1,"I love their Mediterranean pizza and they also serve great beers.  Piranha ale is my favorite, and definitely worth the drive to the suburbs."
1,"Looking for an \""off the strip\"" place to hang out at? I'd make this an option. The drinks are way less expensive than the strip, the service is good. Call in if you have a big group because you might save more with a $100 bottle service. \n\nThe band, most of the time hits the note. I wish they would  bring back the band that plays mostly 90's songs... \n\nIt's close to the strip - but far enough to be a local spot. \n\nThe first year this was open, it was great because I could connect with my 20's and 30's crowd. But for some reason, the geriatrics found the place. And all I see are cougars and dirty old men. Shame on me - but shame on them too. \n\nIt's halfway a bar, lounge and well, don't call it a club. Their security acts like it is though. Anyways - don't come here alone lest be prayed upon by your moms and dads friends looking for young blood to hook up with. \n\nDont get me wrong, if you're coming with a group - you'll have fun. \n\nThe selection of martinis are as good as the selection of beer that Yard House has below and the selection of license plates that The Cadillac Ranch has next door - with that being said: If you don't like the crowd here, go to Yard House or Cadillac Ranch."
1,"Really enjoyed the clam shooters. First time having clam I was a bit scared. No worries, it worked out well. Our waitress Suzzanne, was an attractive 20-something that knew her food well. Her personality definitely made the meal fun. The blackboard menu was a kind of cool tre-shiek touch, but unfortunately as a dumb American, I don't speak French. However, Suzzanne was helpful to figure out the menu and made some great recommendations.\n\nI also went to Garden Manger and thought that was better than this place, but overall, would definitely recommend this place."
1,"Great lunch food! I especially like the spicy pork bulgogi--a generous portion and lots of flavor. Maybe not the best thing to eat on a hot summer day (the spiciness will overheat you for sure) but it sure tastes good. Lunchtime is crowded and loud, but not unpleasantly so."
0,"Went here mid-afternoon when it wasn't too busy.  The server was really nice and the place has a great country western atmosphere.  Drink specials were very good, but the food was AWFUL.  Ordered fried zucchini and mushrooms and they were burned beyond recognition and cold.  Completely inedible - we had to return them. Pasta sauce was worse than what you'd get from a can.  I'd still recommend it as a good place for drinks and entertainment but do yourself a favor, and have dinner first!"
1,The first time we are here our waitress was rude but the food was amazing. Thank goodness we gave it another try because it's become our Friday night happy hour spot. Love that they give you a large portion of chips with salsa AND bean dip which is really good. They also have a FABULOUS skinny margarita and amazing fish tacos. We have never had a bad meal and thankfully that rude waitress is no longer there. Ask for Vince and you will get the best service. Portions are big enough to take home and to-go orders usually come with chips and dips too! This place is just easy and the outdoor patio is nice especially when a fire is lit in the fireplace.
0,"This was the worst place I've ever eaten in Nevada. The staff was rude and very unprofessional. They offered a wing club card and didnt have any on hand. They advertised items on these yellow cards which sounded like a neat idea but trust, it was not. I could hear the kitchen staff in the background talking trash about the patrons in the dining area. It should have tipped me off when the only other people that came in besides the 3 people in the room walked in and walked right back out. They asked us how our food was (wings & burger) and we had to be honest. Horrible.I didnt know you could ruin hot wings, but apparently you can. I've never left food on the plate like this before.  I ordered 12 and left 10. I ate the first one b/c i was trying and the 2nd to make sure it wasnt just a fluke. Ah well at least now I know.  If worse comes to worse go across the street and eat at Mulligan's.  see their review fmi."
0,"Tony B review on 11/27/10 states he had a hair on his fruit.  The EXACT same thing happened to me.  \n\nYou don't get very much food for the price, but what you get tastes good.  If it was a little cheaper and I had not gotten hairy fruit I might have gone 3 stars on this.  I will go back but this is not one of those places that I would rave about."
1,"First time calling! was right on time. Kids almost fainted when they seen the giant 24\"" lol. Had to cut there slice in four haha. Garlic knots are best ive had around here."
0,If you don't care about quality Chinese food panda is the place...\nI don't mess with meat there
0,"I hate dealing with this location, they're slow as hell and rude. Every time I place a call for a pickup there's always a 3+ hour wait for pickup and when you go into the actual location for a sit down dinner you'll spend 3 hours waiting to be seated and for your food to arrive. Also note the staff isn't as knowledgeable about the menu as some of the other locations so you may find yourself telling them about things on the menu.\n\nI questioned them about this long wait and was told it's because they're the only location on the west side....we'll the 10th St & Camelback location has been catering to the ENTIRE Central Phoenix area for years with no issues and the manager just looked at me.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and call the 10th street & Camelback location."
1,"Give me some of that \""peanut butta sauce\""\n\nYou probably don't want this if you're not drunk, but otherwise, c'mon I don't care if it sounds gross to you, no one I know doesn't think this shit is delicious once they've tried it. Withhold your reservations, don't be a snob. Just ask to have some of that warm PB poured all over those greasy fried noodles then squirt some Sriracha and Soya sauce on it. Sounds good, no? That'll be 2 bucks."
1,"So I had no idea this place was so close to me nor that it existed. I got the smokey crepe, which was turkey chorizo Gouda and avocado. It was so delicious! Staff was very friendly. They gave us on-the-house granola and two little toasted rose marshmallows with dark chocolate sauce.\nEnjoyed the atmosphere, felt unique. Next time I'll try the coffee and baked goods! \nAs well as a dessert crepe."
0,"I saw the mixed reviews, and thought, let's give it a chance.  It's close, it has delivery, and I might get lucky.  Even after placing the order with the lady who didn't speak a lick of English (and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times), I thought \""Hey, she can't speak English, it must be authentic!\""  Well, that logic fell short.\n\nThe sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while.  I'm not being a snob.  I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices.  As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh.  Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland.\n\nOn the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content!  So here's to my health."
0,"This company did beat the competitor Chase in rates and fees. My broker seemed legit and wanted the business. Little did I know that he would pass the buck off to other people to finish our loan process. Our escrow was two months... TWO MONTHS and they still waited until 3 business days before closing to request more documentation from us, then threatened to extend the closing date due to us not getting the paper work to them.... I tried calling and pushing 0 \""if this matter requires immediate assistance\"". On hold for 20 min only to get a voicemail every single time!  No return call until days later. Communication = 0 in this company.  They don't treat their customers with respect. They treat customers like they are doing favors for you just by giving you a home loan. I would go elsewhere if I had more time.  The only positive was working with Nathan who gets it done quickly if you speak directly to him."
0,"Nothing I've eaten here has ever been good.  Sure, it only means two meals to review but I'm not a masochist so that's the best you yelpers will get out of me.\n\nI had some lemon grass soup, it tasted as if someone had poured lysol into it.  In fact I stopped after the first spoonful out of concern for my health.\n\nThe fact that this place is still open pisses me off.  I blame the trendy vegetarians who don't know how food is supposed to taste because they've accepted it as a casuality of their dietary choice.  Unacceptable!  Cook at home and wise up so that these places can follow their natural progression to extinction."
1,I LOVE their Oktoberfest! I'm gonna have to check out this place more often! I don't really know German food - but the brats I had were delicious.
1,This was our first visit. The French onion soup was fantastic definitely a recommend. The steaks were done just write and the wait staff was great
1,"The iced tea is amazing, as are the baked goods. I have been known to eat an entire maple scone before even getting back to my office.  I don't drink coffee but I hear it's amazing.  Pass by the Starbucks on the corner and head to Cartel!"
1,"Fitting to write a review of Fat Tuesday on Fat Tuesday so here it is!\n\nIt doesn't matter what day of the week it is, everyday is a good day for a Fat Tuesday.\n\nNeedless to say, one yard dog is more than enough to guarantee you a good time.  Thanks to Jaymie S., my first drink here was a 190 Octane with 2 shots of Everclear.  A total of 8 shots.  It was quite the struggle to finish it once it came down to the last bit, but it wasn't too bad prior to that.  Just make you do a lot of stirring and just inhale your drink like no other.  Get past the brain freeze and you're good to go (plus your taste buds will thank you for it later).\n\nMy party each had our own yard dog and let's just say we were all giddy and giggly for the next couple of hours.\n\nBe warned.  These babies sneak up on you, but thank them, they bring you a bundle of fun."
0,"I feel like it won't be long before this establishment is on the list of failed restaurants that have previously occupied this same space.\n\nThe service is not there, the food isn't appetizing.\n\nThere are other options to choose from within Town Square- I wouldn't recommend McFadden's as one of my faves."
1,"I couldn't be happier with Horizon View Medical, I've had two appointments and each time I got in at my appointed time. Dr. Dunsmoor is wonderful, you won't find a more caring Dr. The staff is great, they are friendly and very efficient. I feel very fortunate to have found this practice!"
0,"I called the casino to ask if I could check in early at 1:30 they said \"" we can't die to our system being down\"" so we came back at 4:00PM they line was put through the casino. I have been in line for two hours. Vegas is not the happiest place on earth. It's not worth it there giving us water and cookies but I'm still dissatisfied with the lack of communication. I will NEVER go to this place again!\nAlso the groups of managers STANDING AROUND IS ADDING TO THE PROBLEM! No one should be smiling who is not helping a guest.\nTwo converging lines open bays of computers no explanation! \nFinally got helped the guy can't hear me because of the loud line and music. Everything they have done has made the situation worse. I don't want 2 for 1 drinks I don't drink!"
1,"History, tradition, star power, kitschy vibe, massive portions, big strong drinks and decent prices......what's not to like?"
0,Low rating due to customer service issues not furniture. Sales person lied about what was in stock rather being honest about back ordered sofa. Stated it was in AZ ready for delivery then a week later after the sale I find out it was actually on back order. Instantly lost me because of lies. Still love my sofa and love seats. Quality is good. When the couch was ready they have me the wrong one. So the low rating was mainly due to poor processes and customer service rather than the furniture. This was the second purchase at Ashley. The first time was smoother with no issues.
1,"Excellent food, excellent service.  Pricey, but definitely worth it.  The ambiance is cozy and classy as you sit in a room with just a few other tables.  The Pot de Creme is amazing."
0,"I never thought I could find an italian restaurant that is worse than Olive Garden - well I just may have found it in Buca Di Beppo. About 15 of us showed up there on a Monday night and all across the table all I heard was that the food quality was terrible and the service was pathetic. Personally, the food that i had (spaghetti/marinara) tasted horrible. The bread was even worse than that. Don't plan on going to this place ever again."
1,This is my REI of  choice in the Valley.  Mostly due to its proximity.  But I have been coming to this location since I lived in the wilds of Northern AZ and would make my way into the valley on the occasional escape to socialize.  REI was my decompression chamber of sorts  before I hit the mall and then hit the town....\nFour years later I am back in AZ and actually living in Phoenix and this REI is my goto place to look for everything from quality outdoor gear or practictical quality clothing.
0,"Seriously disappointing experience at this restaurant. The service was so slow and our waitress was beyond dull and unfriendly. I'm usually crazy about any type of Mediterranean bread, but the bread I had at Husnu's was dry and thick. When our food finaaaaally came it was another disappointment! Everything on my plate and on my husband's plate was smothered in yogurt sauce. There are way, way, way better Mediterranean restaurants in Madison - this place was not worth the money I reluctantly handed over."
0,"Umm, what did I just eat? 9:47 pm and I had a sweet tooth, it was way in the back lol. I had just taken my kids to Baskin Robbins a few days earlier but I didn't get anything that' time, my kids really loved it, but they're kids lol. Anyway I call them up to see what time they closed and to my surprise they were still open, close at 10 pm. I'm there in 5 minutes and decided on my favorite ice cream of all time, Butter Pecan. It was disgusting, extremely flavor LESS! I'm not sure if it was the ice cream or the cone but there's a burned taste in my mouth, never again will I go there, the employees were nice though...  My 2 scoop waffle cone was $4.56, not to expensive but I still want a refund."
0,"Wazuzu isn't all that great but it is better than Red 8.  Service is a little better.  Sushi to be overpriced should be super fresh and a wow that was tasty!  May sure you make reservation or you'll be waiting forever here.  My friends wanted to go early, like 2 hours before our reservation time and they had to wait close to our reservation time. \n\nI would rather do Nobu, Yellowtail, or Blue Ribbon."
1,"For Bar Food, Beer and Atmosphere - It is as good as it gets in PGH."
1,"The Skinny: Extremely good value for a pretty tasty three course menu with white linen tablecloths - for now this is a lunch only place (4) Service is super friendly (4).\n\nOpus Too is the Art Institute's Culinary school restaurant. Yes, it's the training ground for the chefs of tomorrow. They are open 3 days a week for lunch only during the school year. They also require advance reservations.\n\nThe choices are eclectic (to introduce the students to different types of cuisine) so do check out their website before you go to see what they offer. They serve something very different every 1-2 weeks. The food is pretty good (3 stars-ish) and has an outstanding value ($10 for starter, entree, and dessert). Service, albeit untrained, is enthusiastic and pleasant.\n\nIf you have the time one day during the week to check this place out, do go. You won't be disappointed."
0,"Thank you for deleting my review because it shines the light on how terrible this hospital is, Luckily - I have it saved so I can paste it as many times as I'd like, and have shared with everyone I know to avoid this horrific establishment: \n\n\nAbsolute Garbage. Worst hospital I've ever witnessed in action.\n\nMy father fell and fractured his hip.\n\nDay 1:\nthey withold my father from eating as they say hes going to have surgery that day\nwe keep asking, nurses have no idea when he's having surgery\nlunch rolls around, dinner rolls around, still no food and still no surgery (He has low blood sugar, diabetes, and is 74)\nat night they say they realize it wouldn't be able to happen that day, tell him and ask if he wants dinner (which took another hour to be delivered to him).\nMy mom took off work, which cut into her schedule and really screwed us over.\n\nDay 2: surgery scheduled for 3 pm.\nmom gets off work early, we get here at 2 and wait. (Granted I have school, she took off more time for work, and my dad's going without food again)\n\n3 doctor rolls on in, states some genius had a hole in their glove and contaminated all the work equipment which would take an hour to fix. 4 pm rolls around. 5 pm rolls around. 6 pm rolls around. We ask every hour what in hell is going on, still receive no information - at 6, we finally learn that an emergency case came in and they used the room which they had prepped for my dad, and said it would be another 20 minutes.\n6:30 rolls around. they come in tell us another 20 minutes.\n7:15 rolls around. my dad is raging, and we're trying to calm him down but he hasn't eaten all day and is in a lot of pain - I don't blame him for being pissed at this horrendous system they call a hospital.\n7:30 rolls around and they finally get him in, but I forgot to mention the nurses who all gathered his information all went home (boy lucky them) so we got some potato head genius's who roll in asking all the same questions, which just makes this situation feel even more smooth.\nAll in all, this is the biggest joke of a hospital experience I've witnessed.\nIf I was there for the first day, I would have had him transferred to another hospital.\nSurprised my mother didn't. If I was there the first day, I would have probably exploded at the staff about how incompetent they were.\n\nwould not recommend anyone with a sick or injured family member to come here. we came here because it was closer, but next time will definitely tell ambulance or whoever to take the injured person out of their way to banner baywood or banner desert.\n\nPROS:\n- friendly nurse staff\n-clean environment\n-good hospital food\n\nCONS:\n-terrible communcation skills (Between staff and staff-to-patient)\n-horrible bedside manner in shift transition (potato heads waltz in asking redudant questions with a cheeky smile on their face when we've waitied for days and are irate beyond belief. how about some communication if you don't feel like getting yelled at).\n-awful time management and design scheme, how about we make patients wait for days when they have conditions that could put their life in danger if they don't eat.\n\nI would give this place a 0 for their service, and a negative score for trying to hide my review. Disgusting."
1,Encore Hotel ohlalla~\nIt was great how the inside of this wonderful hotel seemed like.\nThere was an big open view when you press the open or something button near my bed the curtains flow across the window and I could see Las Vegas!\nIT WAS WONDERFUL\ni couldnt go to the swimming pool since it was closed so that was the bad part. BUT when i ate at a near by inside restraunt i ate the most DELICIOUS pizza there! it was so HUGE and great! \nhope i can visit again and again! :D and i got kinda confused where wynn was and encore but i got the hang out it haha(:
1,"Stopped here for breakfast today.  Had a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant.  Hit the spot!  This location is right near my office and is very convenient.  I'm not really in the habit of getting breakfast out, but this place makes it very tempting to do so every day!\n\nInstead of coffee I had tea with milk and sugar - interesting combination (first for me) but it was good and it was a good way to start the day.\n\nThe donuts here look pretty amazing and the place is kept pretty clean.  The parking lot can be a little bit of a death trap (depending on how people decide to drive through it).  Good place.  I'll probably frequent it when I start craving donuts or a hot breakfast meal.\n\nThis location is a Baskin Robbins location as well - so ice cream is here.  Donuts & ice cream could fuel me all day... but that would be one bad sugar rush and crash."
1,A solid spot for burrito's! All the staple items with fresh ingredients and great offers... Tuesday & Thursday!
0,"I have tried so hard to like this place because of their great location in the Jean-Talon Market, but a coffee spot on the edge of Little Italy has to do a better job than this. I'm not a fan of their espresso nor of their brewed coffee nor of their beans. (I guess the last item on my list probably covers the other two, eh?)"
0,"Dumpy hotel.  Room was TINY and the darkest room I've ever been in.  TINY and DARK.  Yeah.  Don't stay here...even if the lobby is amazing.  And plus, you're so far from the center of the strip -- that walking is impossible.  So unless you're going to rent a car, buy a bus pass, or use the monorail (yeah right)...then don't stay here.  In fact, I would rather you stay at the less dumpier Imperial Palace than this place.  The Luxor is THAT bad."
0,"I don't expect much from any fast food restaurant.  Truth be told, no honest person does.  It's fast food.  If we wanted a lot, we would just make it ourselves.  What I do expect, and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\n\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30, and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55, and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday, this location is open until 12:00AM, and on the weekends, they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\n\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off, they would be aware because the signs are off, the exterior lights are off, and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\n\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight, but because of the unreliability of this location, I spent my money elsewhere.  \n\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said, the sign-lights were off, the drive thru lights were off, the interior lights were off... on the whole, the place screamed, \""Don't spend your money here!\""), then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\n\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell, but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location, I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \""This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\"""
1,Newly minted McDonald's. Double drive thru which they actually utilize. You definitely get through the line faster.
0,"Its a standard Subway. Unfortunately some employees speak barely english, which makes ordering or asking questions extremly hard. Now, English is my second language too, but at least I able to communicate pretty good.... One lady tends to be rather rude, and ignores people and/or their questions. She sighs a lot when you ask her if she would please (Yes we always say please and thank you!) put more dressing on the sandwich or whatever.\nLiterally, she sigh's! \nMaybe i would be too if I had to work at Subway and all those americans come in and order in english but I dont speak nor do I understand english. \n\nHow rude of us to order in english!"
1,"I think Vic & Anthony's is, by far, the best restaurant downtown. I live in downtown Vegas and try to patronize the area as much as possible and I'm glad I tried V&A.\nMy wife is in a wheelchair, and we had to wait a bit for a table, even with a reservation, because of the stairs to certain parts of the dining room.\n\nNo matter, the servers were all very solicitous, without being overpowering. All of our needs were met quickly; we never waited for anything.  Everything was delicious...Darlene had the lobster and filet special; I had bone-in ribeye. I've dined in many steakhouses here in Vegas, and this is up with the best (LV Weekly had it in its 2nd town). It's the slightest notch below CUT/Carnevino/ Prime triumverate. If I could award 4.5, or 4.7, I would. I just cant give it 5 stars, due to the ADA-unfriendly dining room and the fact that the above 3 (and apparently Ramsay and Old Homestead)are ridiculously sublime. But on a price/location/quality nexus, this place is in the top 10 in town. (Going back next week)"
1,nice store real busy real friendly
1,"Relatively speaking, Le Village Buffet is a great deal for $25.  I recently went there for the dinner buffet and happily waddled my way out after about two hours.\n\nFor the non-meat eaters, the veggie options are really good.  You might not get your 25 dollars worth on veggies, but the grilled veggies, mushrooms, cheeses, and cooked carrots are delicious.  \n\nLe Village Buffet also has a crepe station where a very nice man makes you your very own sweet or savory crepe to order.  There is also a wide variety of dessert items and the mini creme brules are a must have.  Go ahead... have five!\n\nThe meat items are o.k. and the seafood is what you would expect to get in the desert... a little too fishy for me.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful too!"
0,This was my initial visit to this place and I found it wanting.   If you don't drink like my wife and I there is really not much on the menu for you.  When we went there was a total of 4 pages of food on them menu this was a whole book.   The food left us looking for something to balance out the salt and our water was not doing much.   The plates of food were small and the food to price value is low.  The food was fair to good at best.  I have had better for the price.
1,You certainly won't find any better Thai food in Matthews!  This is the sister of the East Blvd. location.
0,"Participants: \nMyself, My Husband\n\nSetting: \nPhoenix, AZ \n\nBackground:\nWe find ourselves at 11a needing to find a decent hotel in the Tempe-ish area with wifi for the night. We have about 3 hours of solid work online to get done, and plans to head out to the Giants game at 6p. This was a frustrating turn in the day, and I had not yet had the chance to shower or eat breakfast, so I was really looking forward to everything running smoothly. We booked this hotel through Travelocity, and the ratings looked satisfactory, so to the Clarion we go....\n\n12:30 - We arrive at the Clarion.\n\nMe:  We have a reservation.\nFront Desk Clerk: Our system is down.\nMe: Oh, does that affect us getting our room?\nFDC: I don't know if you have a reservation.\nMe: I have the email on my phone, is there something you could do? Just give us a clean room and we can straighten this out later?\nFDC: The system is down, there is nothing I can do.\nMe: Uh...Ok. We will go get something to eat and come back. \n\n2:00 - We arrive back at the Clarion after eating (btw, Biscuits restaurant down the street, fantastic) \n\nFDC: The system is still down.\nMe: Ok, that seems not to be getting fixed very quickly, could we please just have a room?\nFDC: There isn't anything I can do, the system is down.\nMe: Seriously? You can't simply give us a clean room and we can figure this out later? \nFDC: I dont' know what rooms are clean, the system is down. \nMe: There isn't anything you can do?\nFDC: There isn't anything I can do, the system is down. \n\n2:45 - We arrive back at the Clarion after taking a drive. \n\nFDC: The system is still down.\nMe: Im sorry that it is, but we would really appreciate just getting into a room, any room. Ill let you know if it is dirty. \nFDC: Let me have you talk to my supervisor.\nFront Desk Supervisor: The system is down, but I can call and check your reservation. It should only take a few minutes, if you can just wait. \nMe: Thank you, I really appreciate it. \n\nImmediately after this, the Front Desk Clerk gets engaged in a conversation with someone that walks in. Granted, it was about a recently retired coworker that passed away, Im not a monster, and give this moment its due. The conversation continued for several minutes while we waited. Finally after close to twenty minutes of waiting, we were given a room key.\n\nI realize at this moment that I should ask about the wifi password when the \""system\"" comes up. She gave it to me, and I was happy to finally get in the room. \n\nWe get into the room and not only was the table covered in very visible crumbs but there is no wifi, even when the \""system\"" was up. All they had was DSL. This was key as we BOTH had to work. \n\nI had to cancel a client meeting, the room was a total joke, and I would give it a value of around $60-70 instead of the $130 we paid. This was the most expensive hotel on our trip, and by far the worst. \n\nDuring the entire exchange with the staff, no one seemed to have any interest in stepping up to make certain we could get what we needed, which was the room we had already paid for. It should not take close to three hours to check into the hotel room. \n\nThis was horrible customer service, and the hotel was mediocre at best to begin with. FAIL."
1,"Everything about this place is COOL. My wife and I brought our 2 boys (ages 7&8 both well behaved) and they accommodated our family very well, especially during desert, our server didn't hold back with the ice cream toppings. Great service, food and view! We will definitley be returning soon."
1,"Surprisingly good. I had my doubts since it seemed overpriced from a glance at the menu, but it was quite good. I had their chicken francese, which is nothing like the typical francese sauce one might expect (creamy, with artichoke hearts and mushrooms). My boyfriend had the lasagna and enjoyed that as well. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is fairly good. They are especially attentive with the water for some reason! We could see parts of the fish tank outside from where we sat in the back...a nice view. Overall, a great experience. Expect to pay $15-$25 for your entree, however."
0,"Went to Bicycle Ranch some years back for a bike fit with Paric (not sure how to spell his name). Never did get fit. He took several measurements, but was never really paying attention as he was busy talking with my wife the entire time. In the end, he moved my cleats back a few millimeters and told me that I need physical therapy to loosen my hips. He did nothing to address my issues with discomfort on the bike. So much for getting what you pay for. Pick another shop if you expect to have a professional fit. I won't even step into that bike shop anymore."
1,"Visited REI today looking for Eagle Creek luggage packing cubes and packing folder.\nThis packing folder is the slickest thing ever for dress shirts and slacks for minimal wrinkle packing.

0,"DO NOT waste your time or $ here!! I ordered a canvas that came with a thick white line going across the whole top.  Their customer service is terrible and refused to send me a new corrected canvas.  I even sent pictures to prove.

I was going to order several more from them until this! I will be spending my $ somewhere else."

0,"As I have fibro and OA, was interested. However, when I called to find out if they accepted any insurance, the RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL guy on the phone said I was asking the wrong question. Then he asked me what I had. Then how long. It was clear what was coming--the standard \""You're miserable, so you should be willing to pay ANYTHING to come to us.\"" I will NOT go there at all because it's clear they do NOT value patients. Their attitude is all wrong. When someone asks a question, give a respectful, honest answer. I would have been FINE with, \""We don't accept insurance. However, for an initial consultation of x minutes, the charge is $y.\"" That's being professional and honest.\nI do NOT for one minute believe these people will do anything other than take your money and do nothing you can't get elsewhere. IF they were really good, they'd treat you with respect and be honest.\nFellow sufferers, many of us are disabled with VERY limited incomes and we've spent THOUSANDS out of pocket in search of help which simply is not there. I'd avoid this place.\nHe just star 69ed and started the sales pitch. This is not a professional organization."

1,"Sears Grand, thank you for saving me from mall hell. If you liked the Sears of old which was usually stuck on the end of some archaic 1950's style barely hanging on for dear life mall then you won't like Sears Grand. And if you're looking for a WalMart competitor you won't like Sears Grand. But if you want a modest selection of clothes, a nicely sized electronics department (albeit staffed by a clueless kid who wouldn't know a plasma from an old tube style TV), a well stocked Craftsman tool area, and an overpriced and small grocery section this is the place for you. \n\nThe jewelry counter is staffed by friendly staff who know their stuff and provide service with a smile. The two people who helped me in the tools section were knowledgeable, and if you know your prices there are deals to be had here. There's also a lot of stuff that is way overpriced. Buyer Beware!\n\nOverall...I still like this place and will come back. 4 Stars. \n\n1st Tip: Don't buy appliances here without checking out the Sears Outlet over on Eastern Ave. first. If you don't mind having a not quite perfect appliance you can save hundreds of dollars. \n\n2nd Tip: Checkout can be painfully slow. \n\n3rd Tip: When you walk in the door grab a sales flyer...chances are it has a coupon in it for a percentage off your purchase or some other kind of helpful deal."
1,"My son recommended Justin and Wright AV to me. We had moved into our house three years ago but could never get our sound system working optimally. True, it was not a high end system but we weren't interested in an upgrade at this point in time. I had three different companies look at it and none of them really had it working well. Generally they were trying to sell me an entirely new system costing thousands of dollars that I wasn't interested in spending. Justin came over within 24 hours of my calling and in short order had my system working beautifully!! In addition to being very reasonable he explained the operation of each aspect of the system. I very highly recommend the work of this ultra professional young man!  Charlie B."
0,I really don't want to give this place any stars... This is the slowest and rudest place in town. I was so disgusted by the rude service that I asked to speak to the manager and sadly enough she responded that she was the manager..  I will never never go to this location again..
0,"Decor is quaint.  We had a bad experience here though .  As we where being seated, we passed 5 open booths.  hostess sat us down at a wobbly table, so we asked to move to a booth.  she pointed at a row of 4 occupied booths, told us to sit here and wait for one of them to open up.  Waitress showed up twice.  once to take order, and once to give check.   food delivered by other staff.  as for the food.\n\nTasteless for the Asian / middle eastern pallet.  no rich flavors\n\nTea -  from a tea bag.  \nbottled water -  smaller than usual bottles.  can fill up 3 guest glasses\nchicken tangine - served skin on, very tender but no taste.\nlamb shwarma -  street vendors in london do better job  \n\nroast lamb.  get 5 pieces of tenderloin sliced -  no taste, very gamey taste that comes  from it being of a certain quality.  high quality lamb does not have that much game taste\n\noverall, not going back.  better middle east options in town for fraction of cost."
0,"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."
1,"This is my favorite place in charlotte, with my grandmothers nursing home across the street and me traveling all the time on an fixed amount to spend per city it's great too just sit by the pond and people watch."
1,"Taste -WONDERFUL\nIt was my second time going to Backthorne for lunch and loved the food. I'm not sure why there are bad reviews on the food but we thought it was excellent. Maybe they switched cooks since last year. I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich with goat cheese and my mother got the butternut squash soup and a chicken salad sandwich. What I like about Blackthorne is that they put a nice twist on their food. The chicken salad had pears and thyme in it which sounds different but was very delicious..I managed to grab a bite. The butternut squash soup had good flavors and my mom wouldn't stop saying how good it was. My grilled veggie sandwich was plentiful with a huge portabella mushroom and other grilled vegetables. The goat cheese and balsamic complimented it well. We both got sweet potato fries with our meal...they were great. Only complaint is that I wish they served it with some honey mustard or something other than ketchup. \n\nPrice - EXCELLENT \nFor lunch, you can get a meal for $10 which includes the meal, a side and a drink. You will pay that at a fast food place or Panera. It's described as an upscale place, which I agree..the atmosphere is very chic. But, you can't beat the price for what you get. \n\nOverall, I'll be going back."

Ordered rotiserie pork tacos, yuk hunks of   fattty greasy  meat..  I would have thought sheredded.\nUncomfortalbe  high stool chairs to sit on with a table that every time you touched it, it leaned way over.  Could not be fixed - we tried putting a knife under the table"
0,"My friends were in town and they wanted something to eat so I decided to pick this place because I haven't tried it yet.\n\nWe ordered family style for the 6 of is except 1 of my girlfriends is a vegetarian so she ordered her own veggie dumplings.\n\nThe lady brought out the food and she was confused about what she brought out. She told us one of the plates were a vegetarian dumpling plate so my friend tried it only to spit it out because there was meat!! How rude! How do you not know what you're bringing out!\n\nWe then proceeded to tell her that they both had meat in it and she was like 'Ohhhh okay.' We were all a bit frustrated because we wanted to wait so we can all eat together.. By the time here came out, our food became cold.\n\nThe juicy pork dumplings were not the business and the rest were meh. I've had better at small hole in the wall places in vegas.\n\nI only enjoyed the chicken wings and the fried dumplings, that's something to enjoy!\n\nI'm giving 2 stars because the lady that was making the dumplings actually came out to apologize when our own waitress didn't."
1,"Neat little frozen yogurt place. The flavors change all the time from what we found out. I would recommend trying the flavors to make sure. I had the NY cheesecake and it was very good. The prices are a bit high, but they have specials that make up for that. Free WiFi also made it a nice little place to hang out.\nThe only downside were the chairs. They need to have some type of stoppers on the bottoms of each as the noise from the chairs sliding on the floor was grating."
0,I have been here way too many times but I am officially done giving them chances. So frustrating that this place doesn't step it up! It is pretty much an overpriced bar. They have a large selection of just mediocre bar food. I love the concept and it's tons of fun for kids. But I can't bring myself to go here again because I can't bare the food. They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!
1,"The Fairmont Princess seems to have gotten its service act together. We stayed here during Baseball Spring Training, and the service was much improved! \n\nNow, if they can only install wi fi, they move up to 5 stars! Note: The Gold section has wi fi. Service is spotty, but the rest of the resort does not."
0,"I went there today after not going since my kids graduated from school 2 years ago , I was shocked to learned they expanded. I thought that was GRRRRRRRRRRRREAT, until I noticed, there was no line at the door anymore or at least two people waiting for them to open, there was a INCREASE In their cost for Donuts. Well I said to myself I will try it. So I noticed the 8.99 per dozen I was going to get two then I thought I better get one .. As I got the one it came up to 9.72 I said what are you CHARGING to use your Credit card machine, she said no its Tax. WELL funny since when you start that.. I got the dough nuts home and they had a TUN of sugar coating, Icing, and grease on them. THIS IS NOT THE Dee's doughnuts I NEW. Wonder if the owners are new. BUT they wont see my business there again. NO THANKS. I went down the street to XYZZZZZZZ Donuts and got 14 for 8.99 vs Dees 12 for 899 plus 6 holes for 9.72 cents.. Hummmm, do the math :)lol.. No thanks Dee's , very disappointed."
0,"Anyone driving out here for the first time should know that once you exit the highway, there aren't any gas stations. I nearly ran out of gas because I didn't know I was gonna end up way out in the boonies. I mean, where do all the farmers out here get their fuel?\n\nAs for the zoo itself, there are some animals that you won't see at the phoenix zoo and of course there's the aquarium but I don't really think I'll be going back. The reason I came here to begin with was so my girlfriend could see some penguins. I have to remind myself that we do live in the desert but the penguin exhibit was really sad. It's very small and although the entire front of it is glass, the entire area quickly fills up with children, obstructing the view.\n\nI think instead of driving from the east valley, next time I'll make the trek up to Out of Africa, which I've heard is quite an experience."
1,"Oh my god, Romados, you are so damn good. How I have missed you. Went on a Friday night after a little tennis session and the place, as usual, had a line out the door. Lucky for my friend and I, we were smart and remembered my tip #2 from my last review. In case you didn't see/read it, it's call ahead of time. Why? 'Cause then you get to skip to my lou to the line to the right and are out the door in 10 minutes instead of waiting for an hour in longing/hatred of the people skipping the line. \n\nWe took our orders of 1/2 spicy chicken and fries deliciousness to Jeanne Mance park as the weather was gorgeous and proceeded to chow down. It was heaven - chicken moist and tender as usual and so, so many fries. Almost endless. It always makes me chuckle how they give you a \""side\"" portion of salad...yeah right, if you want vegetables, you are in the wrong place bubba.\n\nAnyways, for $9.75, you cannot go wrong. Still one of my favourite places in Montreal."
0,so bad ! bad service and nasty food.. sorry I have to give 1 star ..never had such a bad experience!\n\nServer was rude when we ask no ice he gave us this bad look you never forget!\n\nMy chicken inside the pho was stale!

0,"If you have a similar experience to mine described below or are just not happy with Marble Express, try contacting Jason Gerber before giving up on them.  After reading my review he contacted me to attempt to resolve my complaints, personally.  He was legitimately appalled by my experience and offered to go above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of.  He obviously cares about his business but has employees that need to care.  I'm sure he is addressing this. My business was concluded with Daltile so I did not take advantage of his offer. I am glad that I let him know about the issues at his business. This may have been taking a toll on his profits and he may have been wondering why.\n\n\n\n\n\nZero stars if I could have. Avoid this place!!!!!!  Dodged a big bullet today.  I went there to buy 5 slabs of granite for my new house that I'm building.  When I arrived I had to seek out someone to help me by going back into one if the offices.  Despite the fact that I had a list of the Slabs that I needed from my design center, they handed me a piece of paper and sent me into the warehouse.  This was after a lengthy search for a clipboard which they never found.  I wandered down each aisle searching for my granite, which I never located.  I was told that a guy by the name if \""Manny\"" would meet me in the warehouse.  He never showed.  I went back to the office to tell them that I could not find my granite and that Manny never met me.  She said \""I'll try to page him\"".  After another lengthy wait.....nothing.  I went back to the office and handed the lady the paper she had given me and I told her I was going to Daltile.  She said nothing.....no apology, just reached her hand out for the paper.  She could care less.  I'm sure 5 slabs of granite won't make or break their year, but this type of customer service will ruin a business.  But, it's not her business so she doesn't care.  Sad.  I called back after I left and asked to speak to a manager. I was told her name was Dawn Bar but she was not available.....imagine that!  I later did a web search of Marble Express and found horrible reviews which I will copy and paste below.  My wife and I were talking to each other about our experience at Marble Express when we arrived at  Daltile. A contractor overheard us and laughed.  He said that one of his clients was telling him a similar story about Marble Express just 2 hours earlier. I now feel very lucky.  I've used Daltile for my previous home and am using them again.  Their operation is a class act. Here are the other reviews I found by doing a web search on Marble Express:\n\n Jamie W.\n0 friends 2 reviews\n\n\nThese guys are thieves! We ordered and paid for 4 Full slabs of quartzite. When my fabricator received the slabs, two were missing approximately 25% due to breakage (entire corner missing). Shlomo and Leor (father and son) refused to return calls to rectify the situation. We eventually drove (3 hours round trip) back to Marble express because Leor would not call us back. Receptionist told him we were there, we walked out to the warehouse and he was with customers, so we went back to the lobby to wait. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we found out that he left out the back door. Shlomo told us that we got such a great price that we should be happy with what we got. We were charged by the square foot and shorted over $700 of product. When I told him I would take him to small claims court, he told me that it was my word against his! These guys are lowlifes! I'm taking them to small claims court...\n\n3/1/2013\nTiffany K.\n\n\nThis place is horrible...\nThey are extremely shady and it doesn't matter who they hurt. They sold our granite out from under us. Putting a hold on something and signing things doesn't mean anything here. Don't trust anyone here, especially Manny. \n\nNEVER AGAIN! \nThank you Marble Express for ruining our new construction home experience. \nZERO STARS!!!!"
0,"Terrible, terrible, nasty food. Very few selections and poor quality food. The only good part of this restaurant was that we had good service from our waiter."
0,"If it had ZERO STARS I would do that. We went here on a Saturday afternoon, pretty busy throughout Town Square and it was pretty empty inside. The only reason we finally decided to go in is because we had a restaurant.com coupon. Had we not had it I would've been UPSET to pay for mushy garbage.\n\nOrdered (don't order in other words) \n\nChile relleno=sweet outer crust with a greeeezy inside of nasty who knows what. Edible, but not great. No heat, bland tasteless cardboard.\n\nAhi Steak $20 -Overpriced for tasteless seared ahi tuna. It doesn't take much to make a delicious tuna steak, I've even conquered that at home. No taste no spice not even the seasame seeds had flavor. \n\nStreet Taco-It was OK but not great. $4 too much for bland tacos\n\nSangria Blanca was excellent-only good thing there\n\nI'd hate to hate on places but I want to warn people to not go somewhere and spend their hard earned money on bad food. In this economy going out is a special treat. I only review really great or really bad places.\nIt's too expensive and dissapointing. It could have good potential because the concept is great.\nStay away"
1,Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..
0,Freakin expensive.. small portions. I'm definitely not coming back.
1,"Burrito Company is one of me and my fiancee's favorite places in Ahwatukke. Especially now that they moved into a new, larger building, they are super fast and have delicious food! Something that sets them apart from other places is that they offer whole wheat tortillas, an option that I really like.  Everyone that works there is very friendly and we love that you can call in your orders for pick up! I would definitely recommend the Burrito Company and would also recommend that you try the #5 (carne asada burrito)!"
0,"This is my first 1-star review, after roughly 30 reviews.\nAlthough reviews are subjective in nature, I think that Yelp reviews have an air of objectivity, which is why their reputation is what it is. I follow that credo. \nSince I've lived in Las Vegas, for one reason or another (mainly to play penny slots), I've been to practically every major casino in town, at all times of day: 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, and most recently 2 AM.  \nThis is my review of the atmosphere of the Fiesta Rancho casino. I've never stayed in one of their rooms (because I'm a local), I can't remember eating at any of their restaurants, I've never skated on their rink, and I've never gone into any of their nightclubs.\nI'm still scratching my head, regarding reviews written by other locals who live in the NW, yet have stayed in Fiesta rooms (and have checked-in multiple times). Can anyone clear that up for me?\nIn any event, I've not gambled at the Fiesta Rancho more than I have at any other casino.\nHowever, I've personally heard or have been in close proximity to 3 disturbing incidents at this casino, whereas I've not seen 1 at all the other casinos combined.\nWhile playing there, I've heard gun shots coming from the other side of the casino. Many years ago, my car was vandalized in their parking lot. At the time, I didn't pay it a second thought. Last night, a woman's purse was stolen, and the robbers escaped without a security guard in sight. In fact, the woman screamed for a security guard, and one didn't come over for 2 or 3 minutes.\nMaybe this is just a coincidence, but I really don't believe in coincidences.\nLike I said...Even though my own property was vandalized years ago, I continued to play there through last night, so this review is not biased from that event.\nBut, after last night, I'll never play there again. I don't want to worry about potential wrong-doings.\nI'll gamble with money, but I don't wish to gamble with anything more precious.\nSorry."
0,"I don't know if it is just me, but I seem to have bad experiences 9 out the 10 times I come here. \n\nThe location is extremely crowded no matter what. The staff is not helpful, not friendly. I think the biggest issue I have is the lack of proper stocking. I know not all Walmart's will carry certain online items, but damn, I've been bit by this a half dozen times here! I mean what the hell is the point of a Superstore if I can never find my item in the store! \n\nThat said, the venue itself is pretty decent and it is somewhat organized. Overall I would say it has potential to be something better than it is."
0,"My husband and I used to eat at this restaurant all the time.  We always loved the food.  However, the last time we were there , the manager disagreed with where we asked to be seated based on the placement of our highchair.  We did not realize that it was a problem.  Afterall, the hostess sat us there.\n\nWhen the manager saw what happened, he aggressively approached our table, rapped his knuckles on the table, and loudly imformed us that \""this was never happening again\"".  You betcha, Buddy, because after being chewed out by this manager like I was a tardy dishwasher, we weren't coming back.  I was angry and embarassed as this manager was loud enough that people at other tables were staring at us, so I emailed the restaurant's corporate offices right there from my phone.\n\nA few days later, I received a phone call from the restaurant's general manager.  I think that her name was Lisa. At first, I thought that Lisa was going to work this out with me, perhaps apologize for her underling's poor behavior. That just wasn't going to happen.  What Lisa gave me was a second butt chewing.  She interrupted me time and again, and even accused me of being a bad mother because the placement of the highchair was dangerous and against city code, that she was more concerned about the safety of my child than I was.  Had she stopped talking over me for 2 seconds, she would have learned that my husband is an architect and has forgotten more about building and city codes than some diner manager would ever know.  What she didn't know that my husband did know was that the placement of the highchair was well within city egress requirements.\n\nShe then claimed to have reviewed the tape of the manager approaching our table and she that the table rapping never happened.  She was lying.  It did happen.  I saw it.  My husband saw it, and my baby jumped when he did it.  She either did not review the tape or there was no tape to review.  I seriously doubt that they have cameras trained on every table in any restaurant, much less a pancake diner.  \n\nDuring this entire conversation, I kept trying to get a word in edgewise to complain about the way the first manager all but yelled at us.  It was awful, and soon as she was done verbally abusing me, she said goodbye and HUNG UP on me.  I was shocked.  She never had any intention of working this out.  Her intention was to bully me for daring to complain about one of her co-workers.  And sadly, we have lost one of our favorite breakfast spots because I will not contribute a nickel to that woman's salary.\n\nI had heard, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that several restaurants in casinos had recently closed their doors.  If this is how they allow their manager to speak to people, I am not the least bit surprised.  I have since told everyone I know about the abuse that I suffered at this woman's hands and will continue to bad mouth this restaurant every opportunity I get."
1,"This is your standard Chick-Fil-A - consistently good food with friendly staff.\n\nThis Chick is located off of South Blvd in the same shopping center as a movie theater, Target, Old Navy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, Michaels and a bunch of other stuff.  The traffic pattern in the center can be a bit of a cluster, but isn't that true of most shopping centers?  Coming through a little before 11:30 am on a Thursday, I drove straight up to the call box, ordered my #1, quickly paid and was on my way.  The condiments I requested were in the bag, the lack of pickles that I requested was honored and my tea was perfectly sweet.  Eat mor chikin!"
1,This is a really nice salon! Their equipment is top notch. Even their lowest level beds have the high pressure face lamps. I have used the level 2 beds only a few times and already got a great base tan. Plus the bed has a jack for my iPhone so I can listen to my own music if I want. I did try out the upper level Prestige bed the other day. Wow. That bed is AMAZING. It instantly gave me that dark bronze color. The owner is really nice and they do those little extra things like greeting you by name when you walk in the door and offering you a free bottled water when you leave. I'm so glad i decided to check this place out!
0,"I like the brand discount tire but this one in tega cay has a bunch of kids running it.  Brought my car here to get the tires rotated and no one was here (customers) They were just standing around instead of working on my car.  I own a car dealership up in Mooresville nc and spend a ton of money on tires up at that discount tire.  This one needs help,  training and showing here crew people what a sense of urgency is.  The more cars you get in and out the more money you make.   By the way 9 employees here and I have been here for an hour.  Not coming back to this location."
1,Really tasty coffee without the burnt bitter taste of Starbucks.  Staff super friendly without a barista attitude of Starbucks. Only downside is lack of locations.
1,"The Enrico Biscotti Co is a small Italian restaurant and bakery, run by a friendly group of people.  My friends and I stopped in on our lunch break, and we really enjoyed our meal.  It was about $13 including tax and tip for a lunch portion of pasta.\n\nOur server was very friendly, and he immediately brought out a DELICIOUS loaf of bread and oil.  I could have made a meal of the bread alone.  I ended up ordering a pasta dish (name is lost) with red peppers, basil, and plenty of cheese!  It was a great portion for lunch; I was pleasantly stuffed at the end of the meal.  \n\nWhen our server brought our bill, we each got a cute mini biscotti.  With Biscotti in the restaurant name, you expect the biscotti to be some of the best.  This biscotti was definitely great.  The flavor was delicious, and it was fresh.  Who wants to break a tooth on biscotti?  Not me.\n\nOur server was really friendly, and authentically Italian in his flirtatious nature.  It's not \""fast\"" service, but it was good service.\n\nWe tried to order cannolis from the bakery twice, but both days we went, they were completely out by lunch time on a week day.  Bummer!  I'd still love to try one, but I probably will only try once more to get one.  It seems like lunch time is awfully early to be out of such a common Italian dessert.\n\nI will definitely make a return to Enrico's!"
0,Expensive. Poor process flow and service.
0,"I had rented from Enterprise a few times in the past and I remembered them as being very high pressure salespeople regarding extra insurance.  So I was prepared to withstand a sales pitch as we approached the counter, and I was amazed when the subject didn't even come up! My wife and I were given a receipt and told to head downstairs to pick up our car.  But wait, not so fast!\n\nWhen we got to the garage, instead of heading right to a stall where our car would be, we came to a booth where we were offered a \""complimentary\"" bottle of water. Then man in the booth told us it would be a few minutes because there were some people ahead of us.  I soon noticed that there were about half a dozen young men and women, all nicely dressed (men with shirt and tie, women wearing dresses), who were escorting customers to their cars.  Seemed out of place for an airport garage. At this point I began to smell a rat.  \n\nI was therefore not surprised at all when the young lady who escorted us to our car launched into the insurance sales pitch. \""Who is your insurance agent?\""  \""What is your deductible?\"" \""Do you realize that you would be initially responsible for any damage, and only later would we try to collect from your insurance company?\""  We had to grin and bear it for a few minutes before she gave up.\n\nI really feel this is something of \""ambush\"" sales technique, and I resent it, Enterprise.  I will avoid doing business with you in the future."
1,"This place is awesome. Simple, tasty, stylish, we'll be coming back here again and again."
0,"After reading the other yelp reviews I was looking forward to trying this place.  I generally like asian food. Unfortunately it didn't deliver\n\nI had the chicken teriyaki bowl on brown rice.  The flavors didn't mix well.  The teriyaki seemed more like straight soy sauce and the carrots were raw.\n\nI also ordered the lettuce wraps (I was hungry) which were slightly better.  The sauce was flavorful but the chicken filling seemed like they put it in the blender for too long.\n\nThere aren't a lot of great food options in the Charlotte airport but unless you are craving Asian stir fry, I would look elsewhere"
0,First time I went here when they first open on rancho. It was packed. Food weren't what I expected. There's at least 20 workers inside passing around food without any gloves. It was disgusting!!!! Went back here today just to see if there's any improvement. But it was horrible! My food was super greasy and told me to park upfront and wait for 5 minutes for my food. Then it's been 10 minutes so I went back to the drive thru. Serving me greasy food and they passing around my box of food. Didn't even apologize for taking forever and just hand me my food and close the window. Will never recommend this to any of my friends including everyone on yelp. It will just ruin your day. I'm a business owner myself so I know what's satisfaction means.
0,"I honestly don't like to write reviews about fast food places, because really, for the most part you get what you pay for, and there's nothing extraordinary, or un-extraordinary about the food usually...its just a quick easy fix.\n\nThat being said - really not impressed with the Chick-fil-A on Stapley. I went through the Drive Thru tonight - Friday night around 9:30. There's literally no one inside and only one car in front of me. And yet they had me waiting at the window forever for my food. Most fast food joints - you're in, you're out, done deal. Not the case here, at least not tonight.\n\nI finally got my food, and the fries could barely pass as warm. I thought maybe the wait was because the guy was doing a new batch of fries, but no, these were quite stale, no salt, and pretty much cold within a short time.\n\nThe soda - Diet Dr. Pepper - was watered down. \n\nThere were like 8 people behind the counter just messing around not doing anything.\n\nAnd it cost me over $7 for a crappy meal. Lesson learned, will not be returning there."
1,I am glad we finally have a boba/tea place up in Summerlin. It is cheap and good for the summer. I was amazed how good their spam musubi was!
1,"Good food at cheap prices. The service is very good. The servers are extremely friendly & helpful.  I had the country fried steak with eggs and it was good.  The portions are big, so you can share one dish with two people depending on how much you eat."
1,"Our first visit, right after they opened in McFarland, was fair, although the pizzas were aggressively priced.  Not to mention nearly $4 for a little pile of greens called a 'side salad'.  Ahem, right.\n\nOur second visit was much more successful- I ordered the lasagna, Mister ordered a chicken caesar.  Both were good, and the pesto hidden in the lasagna was a tasty treat.  \n\nService was good, as were the leftovers!"
1,"A wonderland of food.  I normally do not like buffet food, because I wind up getting one plate, and I'm done.  At this place, I got seconds and thirds, and it even had a good selection for my vegetarian friends."
0,"First of all, not sure why this is called a \""resort.\"" It's a motel. Yet, it was near where I was staying, and I got a deal on the room, so I decided to stay for a few days.\n\nThe room next to me had people standing outside smoking and drinking until 2 a.m. I suppose that isn't the hotels...errr....resorts fault. But I'd think security or something would check periodically and tell people like that to pipe down, or stay in their rooms, as others are there to sleep, not \""hang out.\""\n\nMy room key didn't work. They gave me another one that worked, though. Still, a pain in the butt.\n\nIn the morning, had the breakfast. There was a good spread of food. Oranges, apples, bananas. Various breakfast cereals, French toast, scrambled eggs, and potatoes (which were way too salty), and muffins.\n\nThe TV had a great variety of channels. But...the room only had one blanket, and I couldn't figure out how to turn the heat on. The room was freezing!!!! Also, it had only four small, really tiny pillows on the bed. Not sure why they didn't have regular sized pillows.\n\nThe next day...there was hardly any food for breakfast. After waiting 15 minutes, still no food (just cereal and oranges, and juices). Somebody complained, and five minutes later, they brought stuff out.\n\nOverall, it just wasn't a very good experience.\n\nThe staff at the front desk was pleasant enough. They had two computers in the lobby which I was able to use (as I'm the only person on the planet without an iphone).\n\nOverall, I just didn't think the price warranted what you get."
1,"Been here multiple times, never fails when it comes to being absolutely delicious! I'm a big fan of soy lattes, the vanilla and the Nutella are my personal favorites.  Coffees are light and just the right amount of sweet, they add the cutest personal touch by putting designs in the froth. Love coming here on rainy days as the atmosphere makes me feel like I'm a part of \""Sleepless in Seattle\"" or a rustic city which makes life slow down for a bit, letting me enjoy and appreciate my day just a little more.  I also suggest the macaroons, almond and passion fruit are my picks, but all of them are great. Check it out, great way to chill out."
1,"First visit back on May 10, 2012.\n\nFood looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.\n\n$2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.\n\nThe guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions (\""what's the vampiro?\"" \""the 'vam-pee-roh,'\"" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.\n\nThere's a/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.\n\nThe asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.  Give this place a shot if you're staying on the strip, it's on the right hand side as you drive down Las Vegas Blvd, right around the time you hit Circus Circus.  Tip: learn the side streets (i.e. Paradise Rd), and avoid the terrible traffic."
0,"Gross.  I had the Natural.  Overcooked tasteless burger with no juice left whatsoever.  Won't be coming here again.  The fries are thick, flimsy and greasy. The kids meal came with canned fruit."
1,"Whipped in here for lunch today & got situated in a comfortable booth for my first ever visit to this Macayo's.  It's a big, very nicely styled place, & I ordered from the \""Mex & Match\"" special menu that's available on weekdays.  You choose 1 or 2 main items & 1 or 2 sides.  Right away (even though it was noon), my server showed up with a BIG bowl of chips & a cup of their TERRIFIC chunky salsa to get me started!\n\nI ordered a Chile Relleno & a shredded beef hard taco for my main items, & Tortilla Soup & veggies for my sides.  Soon my soup arrived, chock full of chicken breast meat, avocado, cheese, & more.  This also was VERY, VERY GOOD!\n\nAt the appropriate time my main platter arrived, with a BIG Pablano Chile, stuffed with delicious Oaxaca cheese, a good-sized shredded beef taco, & a large serving of steamed vegetables, including zucchini, broccoli, carrot slices, & red bell pepper.\n\nPeople rant that, \""Ooh, it's part of a chain!\"" or \""Ooh it's Gringoized, Americanized Mexican food\"", or whatever.  What a bunch of caca toro!  Get your burro & get over here ahorita, because this place is \u00a1CINCO ESTRELLAS, PERIODO!     :-))\n\nMex & Match with 4 items \u00a1precio barato! a $8.79."
0,"I hate stores that attempt to \""keep you coming back,\"" and such is Kohl's.  Every day there's a sale - potentially better than the sale the day before - not to mention \""Kohl's Cash,\""  and coupons which can be found on their website or in the local paper.  Yeesh!  No piece of mind feeling you got a good deal - and quite honestly, I'm not sure a \""deal\"" can be had, as price tags far exceed value...the reason for continual sales.  Okay enough bashing, you get the picture.  So what's good?  The offering of women's slippers at Christmas time.  Fun, funky and you guessed it.  On sale!"
1,"I've recently begun working out at Barre Definitions and I've been really impressed. The classes are challenging, but the instructors are supportive and provide guidance for every fitness level. Barre fitness is great for toning, especially those difficult to train areas."
1,"At first I have pretty hesitant to try Wildflower, but my girlfriend assured me I would be pleased. In my mind I imagined a hipsters paradise next to the Changing Hands bookstore that I really would disapprove of going to. Trusting her knowledge of my stomach, I went with her there one night for dinner. Boy was I wrong. Wildflower is filled with young professionals, students, and other local members of the community and is pretty anti hipster *phew*. \n\nAt the rear of the restaurant is their counter and cashier station. The counter is filled with such amazing treats, and on wooden shelves behind here are dozens of freshly baked loaves of bread. The best part is that on fridays they have challah! \n\nFor lunch of dinner, I order the 1/2 sandwich and soup special. While they change their soup selection daily (they usually have around 4 choices), I generally order the chicken noodle and the almond tuna sandwich. This sandwich is very delicious. My girlfriend loves their pesto pasta with chicken, but they only serve it during the dinner hours.\n\nFor $7.25 you get a great meal that will convince you to come back for more."
1,"Review #200\n\nI got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.\n\nThe sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:\n\nAll of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.\n\nLemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.\n\nThumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!\n\nIs the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)"
1,Great place for dinner...  Nice setting and friendly staff!  The food came within five minutes of ordering and it was phenomonal!
0,A group of us gathering for a reunion were all so excited to eat here as we are all huge Gordon Ramsey fans. So we were very disappointed that the food was all very bland which would have been fine had there been salt and pepper on the table. We couldn't visit or catch up at all because the music was very very loud and we had to yell but still couldn't hear. So I really wouldn't recommend trying the place as it is really expensive and with all of us sampling each other's dishes we were all disappointed.
1,"Great, lunch or dinner. Comfortable room with minimal decor or distractions.  Rarely full so easy to bring families or groups without advance planning; it seems people don't know about the great food here. Lunch specials until 2pm and great selections on the menu. Best meal for the value."
1,Carlos working the grill was very courteous and respectful. Nice to see customer oriented service still is alive in some establishments.  The al pastor is excellent and the carne asada is very tasty as well
1,"Recently ate breakfast here on a Sunday morning in mid Oct '13.\n\nWait : 20 mins for 2 patrons at 10:30am. : 3 stars\nDining room : simplistic but acceptable appointments (furniture, wall decor) : 3 stars\nMenu choices:  plenty of options, and menu was easy to read : 4 stars\n\nFood : my party ordered :\nbreakfast burrito - 5 stars, \npancakes - 5 stars, \nscrambled eggs - 4 stars, \nbacon - 3 stars, \n'work' potatoes - 4 stars, \nfruit plate - 4 stars\n\nValue : reasonable prices for quality of food, good prices for quantity of food\n\nSummary :\nI enjoyed my visit and would visit again."

1,"My first time eating Thai food and La's Thai Cuisine and it did not disappoint! \n\nThai food has always been on my list but I never was intrigued enough to go out and try it until now. I'm glad I did because its absolutely delicious! We went during lunchtime on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed! After eating, I can see why. The portions are huge and cheap. What more can you ask for?\n\nWe were given an ordinary salad (ice burg, carrots, and tomatoes)  with a very sweet tasting vinaigrette. Didn't really enjoy it because it was too sweet for my liking but it was free so I shouldn't be complaining [: It took us a long time to order because I am a very indecisive person and everything sounded so good. They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai. \n\nWe end up ordering a peanut curry with chicken and pad thai with tofu. The peanut curry came with rice and the pad thai came with a mix of lettuce and cabbage. Both came with a vegetable eggroll. We asked for medium spicy which was a little bit too spicy for me because I can't tolerate it too much but medium was enough spicy for my friend. Next time, I would definitely go mild. \n\nHow it work is you pick your dish then they ask you to pick your protein. I think its between beef, seafood, chicken, tofu, or vegetable. Then you pick your spice level. \n\nOh and we ended up ordering mango sticky rice for dessert. Sweet sticky rice topped with coconut milk and a side of mango. It was delicious! My friend said it tasted like the one he had in Thailand and when we spoke to the owner, he said he makes the sweet sticky rice fresh everyday [: (I liked the black sweet rice more and my friend likes the white one but whichever one you order should be fine cause they are delicious!)\n\nOverall we enjoy the food very much. I can't wait to try other Thai dishes from here. Only downfall is I live so far away but I found out the owner lives near me out in East Mesa. Poor guy. Commuting must be a pain. I would definitely recommend this place. Now I think I'm brave enough to try other Thai places.\n\nThanks La's Thai Cuisine for giving me such a good first experience!"
0,"I used to like this place, and now I HATE this place! I would rather be starved instead of going back!\n\nI came here a year ago and the experience was good. This year I came again and it's totally worse than last year. The service was lacking. First of all, we made a reservation through Open Table, and we were very sure it's made because at first, the hostess was able to see it and be able to say my husband's name correctly. So after we got seated down, we notice that the points weren't added to our open table account yet, so my husband asked the hostess about it to see if they have checked us in. But then at that point the hostess said he didn't make any reservation, I guess they deleted it after we got seated, as we couldn't even see the record on our open table account either. The record was there before we got seated, and then disappeared after we were seated. So we didn't get to have out points on open table and it's definitely their fault, not ours.\nAt the end, when we got our check, we forgot to show them the Total Reward card to get the 10% discount, and my credit card has been swiped but I haven't signed yet. So we asked if they can redo the bill for us. They said no because the credit card has been swiped. I got too upset that i didn't argue with them and just paid them and decided not going back. I know that it's not final as long as I don't sign the receipt, they could have voided the one that I haven't signed, and redo the bill with my total reward discount. I know other restaurants would do that as that happened to me in the past. They just needed to void the charge on my card especially I haven't signed. I still give them 15% tip at the end though I am totally dissatisfied with their laziness and wrong doing (including messing up our open table reservation). They don't deserve tip but I gave 15% anyway, as this is the last time they would see me setting foot at this particular restaurant.\n\nI want to note that the service at the one in Town Square is way way way better than this one in Paris Hotel. The Town Square doesn't offer Total Reward discount (of course as it's not in the casino) but their price is lower than the one in paris hotel. Unless you really really really want to look at Bellagio Fountain while eating, otherwise, there is no point to eat at this one at Paris Hotel. You don't really see much of the Bellagio Fountain anyway if you are not sitting at the outside patio.\n\nI am not going back to this Sugar Factory in Paris Hotel ever again. I think it's either the employees lacking training, or the management of this particular one is not doing their job well in training their staff, or maybe the management didn't treat the employees well making them staff not doing their job well. \n\nIf you want to ask me about the food, the food is better at the one in Town Square as well. I always like their red velvet sundae but this time they have changed it to something that tasted so nasty in SF Paris Hotel. While the red velvet sundae at the one in Town Square is still good. I visited both within the same week, so the comparison is a fair one. And yes, I had red velvet sundae twice within the same week but at different location. The one in Town Square is much better than the one in paris hotel!!!!!! At the one in Town Square, the server and hostess are way better, they didn't mess up our open table reservation, greeted us nicely, always have smiley face. The staff (including the management, not just the staff on the floor) at SF Sugar Factory requires a lot of improvement."
1,The best fast food burger joint in the country as far as I'm concerned.  I can't wait until they make their way to Houston...it shouldn't be too long now!
0,"I went with a party of 7.  The service was exceptionally slow.  It was so slow that several members of the party nearly had to leave before their food arrived.  We pleaded with our waitress to help move things along.  When the food finally arrived two of the orders were wrong.  A warning, don't order the black stout if you have anything else to do for the rest of the day.  Instead of pouring the stout like professionals and scraping off most of the head, my waitress told me they just let it sit until the head goes down.  I had two, they took forever to get and when they arrived they had nearly a 3 inch head.  It is good stout, but I don't like paying for a lot of foam or waiting for something that really doesn't happen."
0,"Went on a Friday night - last minute reservation.  We were seated immediately and met by our waiter who was enthusiastic, friendly, witty and made us feel comfortable.  That is as good as the night got.\n\nWe ordered the Kushi oysters.  I have had them before and they are sweet and delicate.  For some reason there was way too much Siriacha sauce on them and completely overpowered the oyster.  We had to scrape off the hot sauce to salvage them.\n\nNext up was the scallop ditch for my wife and I had the Snake River Farms NY Strip.  Both dishes were so salty that we couldn't finish the meals.  The medium rare steak was exceptionally poor quality with ribbons of silver ribbon that made the steak inedible as I couldn't cut through let alone chew the meat. The steak also was finished with salt and there was so much on the top that it was crunchy.\n\nThe waiter tried his best to rectify by bringing another portion of La Ratted Potatoes which were actually very good, but the bowl only has about 2 millimeters of potatoes and didn't save the day.  Unbelievable small portion size.\n\nThe waiter sold us that he was disappointed in the quality of the food as well and that he would call his manager.  We didn't ask for anything or want any food replaced, just wanted out.  The manager was not very empathetic and tried to comp a desert or something else which we politely declined.  He didn't have much else to say and went back to the bar to continue his conversation with two lady customers sitting there. What a manager.\n\nThey did take our cocktails off the final bill.  The waiter deserves 5 stars, but the chef actually 1 star for the potatoes.  Ambiance is nice, but would never recommend."

0,Never again...never again!!' This place is terrible!!!!!!! I would never go here. Save your money!!!!!!!!!!
1,Today was my 2nd visit and must say was just as impressed as I was a month ago. Staff is friendly and helpful - explained things well when I asked several questions. \n\nAll burgers come complete with 2 patties and are very filling. Sweet potato tater tots are delicious!
0,Went for a 40th birthday party. Service was good. Waitstaff worked hard to keep up with drink orders. It was a pretty big party & some major cash was spent. Picked up my tab at end of night & very reasonable DESPITE that they added a 20% gratuity onto everyone's bills. Wonder how many drunk people accidentally tipped 40% that night?! Now here comes the one-star... a party attendee had her handbag stolen from the bar. It happens. But guess what! Half the contents turned up behind the bar (where only staff could have accessed). Cops called - big to-do. Manager was less than helpful- without talking to staff said it absolutely couldnt be one of them. Miraculously - remaining contents turned up the next day - including jewelry & cash. What an honest thief! Reeks of inside job. STAY AWAY!!!
0,"Not sure how the levels of service vary so drastically between Starbucks, but this location is literally the worst one I've ever been to. And, it is unfortunately the closest one to my house. The service is always extremely slow, so decent personalities behind the register and no noticed care for their customers. I've been at this location several times hoping it wasn't just one bad day, but it's been every time. Why does it take over 10 minutes to make a passion tea? And no \""sorry for the wait\""? This location really needs to get completely restaffed."
1,"Southern Rail, what a restaurant should be!  You can't only judge an establishment by the excellent food, you have to take in the entire experience...they crushed it!  Wait staff was awesome, Drew, our server was personable, gave great recommendations and was attentive without being overbearing.  The ambiance is phenomenal as it feels very relaxing and comfortable.  The build out is awesome from the wood plank ceilings to the southern style bar!  The food had tremendous flavor, was well prepared and very original; a decent amount of options for non-pork eaters too.  Highly recommend great times had by all, thanks!"
1,"This place was grrreat!!! The rooms were clean and the food was cheap... and I don't care what anyone says, all the native Hawaiians are cool. All the table games were cheap enough for a weekend but they still took most of my \""designated\"" gambling cash. The only problem I have with this review is not the hotel, but the area. The whole Fremont experience blows ass. The street was covered with trailer park, white trash, thuggish ruggish, drunk-out-of-their-mind, slutty, scum-baggy people. Luckily I didn't see any of those peeps in the California. The rooms were the best part but why didn't I give the full five stars?.. we paid $14.99 to watch \""Role Models\""... they saw us coming....!!!.. hahaaa"
0,"When the owner of the franchise has the customer service skills of an angry ape, it's no suprise fellow yelpers are down on this place. Purchased food through the drive through a while back and the order was filled incorrectly. So went back to the store, and after dealing with the manager just wanted a refund. He refused to provide a refund because he said we were rude. Ended up leaving food at the counter and walking out the store. Not worth the time, maybe Dickie's corporate will take it back."
1,"I've been here a few times over the past 3 years and it's been consistently good! The wait staff is knowledeable about the menu and very happy to accommodate any special requests. \n For Appetizers I've had the Calamari which was deliciously seasoned and served with a tasty blush type of tartar sauce however I asked for a side of marinara that was gladly and promptly brought to me.  The Arancini were tasty and nicely seasoned. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a good amount peas, meat sauce and mozzarella on the inside. The presentation was beautiful with basil leaves on top and served over some marinara (which was way too skimpy of an amount but they'll gladly give you more!)\nMy friend and I had the Eggplant Parmigiana and Veal Parmigiana both of which were delicious. The eggplant was breaded and fried lightly with just enough marinara and melted mozzarella on each slice. The veal was tender and well seasoned as well.  They've also got a nice wine list with  reasonable prices. I also like the way they redecorated the dining room with multicolored ceiling tile and the Trinacria. This place is always busy so I'd suggest a reservation especially if you have a larger party."
0,"One of the dullest hotels I've stayed in.  Food was subpar.  Sheets smelled of mildew and A/C was not properly working.  When I woke up, I swear I thought I was in a cheap motel and not a Sheraton.  Wifi only in the lobby area.  There is free wired internet in the rooms."
1,Amazing food and value - authentic and delicious. Very nice and hard working host - we didn't mind the wait as this lady works  real hard.
1,not the best
0,"We went in there to see what the place was all about. Eh not so great. The coffee is pretty bland. We le a good smooth coffee that doesn't taste like tea. The food really had no flavor. The sausage was eh, meat with no flavor, eggs well you really can't screw up an egg flavor wise. For the price not worth it. We will not be back."
0,"I've been coming to sushi Mon for past 10 years now. Whenever I make a trip to Vegas, I always make sure to stop by. For past 3 years, they started to decline in their taste and the quality of the sushi. Last visit I had a week ago, the food was terrible and they confused my name with another person's name on the waiting list. So my family had to wait another extra 35 min with an initial hour wait. The manager was extremely impolite and hesitant to apologize. Sushi Mon is not the same as it was years ago. I won't come here anymore. It's time to find a new AYCE sushi in Vegas."
0,"Je cherchais  un restaurant a sainte Anne de Bellevue. A quelques reprises j'ai essay\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rentes terrasses sans trouv\u00e9 un restaurant qui voulait que j'y retourne. Ce n'est malheureusement pas diff\u00e9rent ici. En ce beau lundi apr\u00e8s-midi nous sommes accueillis gentiment a la porte et nous pouvions choisir une table sur le bord du bordwalk. La serveuse Rachel est venu rapidement nous saluer, nous expliquer le menu et nous offrir un ap\u00e9ro. Je voulais commander 2 verres de vins mais elle s'est empress\u00e9 de nous d\u00e9courager de prendre un verre seulement puisqu'il est a 9$ chacun et qu'une bouteille est 'seulement' 25$. Le genre de 'gammick' pour vendre des bouteilles seulement.  Un menu lunch a 12$ avec un bar a salade inclus semble int\u00e9ressant et c'est pour cette raison que j'ai choisi le resto. Je choisi donc le sous marin au steak Philly et ma copine celui au poulet.  Les deux servis avec frites. Rien a redire sur les deux sandwichs. Pain et ingr\u00e9dients frais. Mais pour les frites c'est manqu\u00e9. Des frites congel\u00e9es sans go\u00fbts. Pour ce qui est du bar a salade, rien d'impressionnant. Salade verte, de l\u00e9gumineuses et de p\u00e2tes. Malheureusement , un autre restaurant qui je vais ajouter sur la trait\u00e9 liste de restaurants pour touriste."
1,"A golden hotel without a casino. You think Trump would have built an elevated golden sidewalk to lead his masses from the hotel to at least Fashion Show, but sadly no... A bit of jay walking, dodge that taxi and loffers in the dirt get you to the strip. On the bright side, the 49th floor standard room has a GREAT view of the strip, is super spacious, has free Wi-Fi, kitchenette & a WHIRLPOOL Tub! Well worth the Jay Walking ;D"
0,"Sushi . .  baklava . . .  Brazilian BBQ? Is Brazilian BBQ the new trendy food option that everyone pretends to like just to be down? Maybe. I'll reserve my judgment because this was my first and so far only BBBQ experience. \n\nHere's how it works: They have a buffet with salad, beans and rice, which is good. Then people come to your table with different types of overcooked meat and put it on your plate. They have a turkey meat that is basically turkey sandwich meat in cube form. At $40 per person, the food was disappointing. \n\nLuckily, our waiter probably sensed we were underwhelmed and put an imaginary $40 off coupon or our bill. However, even at half the price, I wouldn't go back to Pampas. I'd rather get room service and listen to Nancy Grace tell me her opinion of Tiger Woods."
1,"What a gem of a place in old town Scottsdale. Has it all from ambiance to service. They use as many local products as possible, great bruch sparkling wine selections. Prices are great and portions spot on. This place is must try, I will be going there again!"

0,"The owners of this establishment are the strangest, most bizarre I've ever seen they watch you from a distance and they yelled at my date telling her that she did not know how to eat her food properly because she asked for crushed red pepper. I would eat there much more if they weren't so rude. \n\nAlso, another experience I had there when a friend had a Groupon you could tell the lady owner was not happy and we even presented the coupon before we ordered, as if that should make any difference on how they prepare it.\n\nI've never felt a more bizarre dynamic in a food establishment in my life."
1,"heard about grimaldi's for quite some time. so i gave it a try! we ordered for pick up only cause i had a busy night of studying and projects to do... ordered 2 pepperoni pies and would be a 30 min wait for pick up which gave me more time to study. we arrived to grimaldi's and for some unfortunate incident, they only had 1 pie ready, so the party of a lot at home waiting, had to wait even longer. but they sat us at the bar, while they corrected our order. and offered us free drinks as we waited for the 2nd pie. after couple minutes, our official order was ready! as a compliment for their ordering mistake, they gave us $10 gift certificate to come back. now, the pizza was yummy! i love me some thin crust. cheese was on point and the pepperoni was sliced just right to fit in your small bite. love love love. enjoy!"
0,"Fries are burnt, the sole is frozen, the pasta are mushy, butter pasta for kids has peppers in it when you ask for 3 times for just butter. The waiter was nice, but the mediocrity of the food makes this an over priced proposition."
1,"Husband and I were craving a good breakfast and it was after 11am. I enjoyed the goat cheese/ sundried tomato/ basil scramble w/ their crispy yum potatoes which had lots of diced red onions and bell peppers mixed in.  Loooved it!  My jaw dropped when I saw my husband's plate of monster pancake w/ blueberries and candied walnuts. I actually said, \""Holy sh--\""  as a genuine response to it. Plenty of good coffee and attentive service as well. The place was hopping and there was a 20 min wait before we got seated.  \nWas surprised that this popular spot is located up some escalators inside the Imperial Palace Casino. Don't think we would ever have found it otherwise if it weren't for Yelp. Would definitely come back to try some other items."
0,"I really should know better by now... If it's not a dedicated sushi restaurant.. Don't order sushi!! It's like ordering fish at a burger place!\n\nSushi looked amazing but the rice on their rolls was a bit hard.  Needless to say I didn't finish the meal otherwise I would have hurled!\n\nI also had their pot stickers which again I did not enjoy.  Sad to say but lean Cuisines have better potstickers!\n\nLastly but not least, their brownie desert was ... Meh.\n\nPerhaps had I ordered a different entree I would have had a better experience."
0,"There's only one thing keeping me from giving this place one star, and that's the 2 for 1 deal on main courses at lunch time that makes this informal cafe-cum-eaterie very good value for money. Clearly the student in me is still governing my wallet as I certainly wouldn't go back at any other time, and I probably wouldn't go back at lunch because the waiter who served my friend and I was such a mardy arse. The impression she gave us was that she really didn't want us to be there - and I can not think of a worse impression to give customers. My friend complained that she wouldn't even look her in the eye and she gave me a permanent frown. Zero stars for her. Actually, maybe that's a bit generous.\n\nI had an ordinary coffee and a salad and my friend had a thai chicken curry. My salad had far too much dressing and as a result was quite acidic. At \u00a34.50, you can't ask for a lot more than that. The thai curry looked better, to be fair, and both dishes were left clean. The furnishings are adequate but not too comfy or intimate. This would not be a good place to go on a date, for example. But if you're looking for a cheap lunch and are kicking about Broughton Street, it'll do. They're advertising staff, you see. Things could get better on that front."
0,"This restaurant consistently lacks any type of service whatsoever. I did not realize picking up an order for my friend can create confusion with the staff. Whoever took the order did not even place the order. Instead of telling me to patiently wait and that they will rush the order, they just looked at each other confused and pretended I was not there. I told one of the server to \""forget it.\"" Instead of stopping me, perhaps offering a drink while I wait for them to rush the order, they just let me walk out. I guess business is not needed in this town that you would not do anything when a customer walks out unsatisfied."
0,"We have been to this location several times. On each of the occasions, the service has typically been pretty great. However, the food is always not been so great. The food is usually lukewarm at best. They even have new oven baked bowls which I thought would make the food warmer but if anything it was worse then the last time I went there. The food at this Olive Garden location simply sucks compared to other local Italian restaurant places you can find in the Charlotte area.  This is just another chain Italian restaurant that should be ignored unless you are in a city that only has the Olive Garden as an Italian option. Goodbye Olive Garden. I can see why investors and myself are done with this restaurant. Stale and overpriced. Peace."
1,"Pretty much the bread and butter date night or sweet tooth du jour of NoDa. You really can't go wrong at Crepe Cellar. \n\nThe crepes are made with buckwheat, so you may be in for a bit of a surprise at first bite. A a little more chewy, earthy, and malty than your mom's crepes. Definitely better for the savory variety. \n\nOne of the strengths of Crepe Cellar is their offering of savory and sweet crepes. You definitely need to try the Queen City savory. Wonderful flavors. Can't believe how much it made me love chicken, mushrooms and spinach together. Who knew all it took was a buckwheat crepe? The oven-roasted tomato dressing goes good on ANYTHING. Definitely the center stage act of this dish. \n\nWhen it comes to sweet, just try anything. You won't be unhappy. Especially with a piping hot brownie, ice cream and accompanying a warm, fresh crepe. Come on, America. France is right on this one. \n\nLastly, alcohol. I love that they have so many good beers. Both both bottle and draught. Lots to choose from. Or, if you're a redneck like me, PBR is pretty cheap here. Hell yes. If you're of the classier alcohol mantra, definitely go for the Cellar Cider. Wonderful little concoction. Baron Jager and a few other spirits. Definitely worth the dough. \n\nLimited seating here, folks. Make sure you get here at a decent hour or put your name in and walk the streets of NoDa. Typically an hour wait or so on busy nights. \n\nYou'll be pleased with your visit. Bar none. One of the staples in the Queen City."

1,"After hearing soooo many glowing reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try.  This place definitely lived up to the hype; donuts were super fresh and yummy.  Half a dozen of donuts cost around $9.00 but it was worth it.  My favorite was the chocolate bar, perfect balance of chocolate and dough. Cashier was very friendly and patient.  I will definitely be back."
1,"Pei Wei is consistently fresh, tasty, and a good value.\n\nThis location is no different, and during the rainy storm of the century last week, it did the trick for a great lunch.\n\nI don 't know a ton about this area, so I can't help much, other than saying it's in a strip mall, surrounded by other retail stores. If you've been in one Pei Wei, you've essentially been in them all. The one strange thing with this location, is that near the drink section, there are a row of bar style seats. They are nice looking, but when people are sitting in them, they pretty much block the pathway from the beverage section to the main seating area. Weird.\n\nAnyway, if you are in need of a tasty, predictable lunch, this is a good spot."
0,"I went to Hambone's on the Saturday of the Lawrenceville Cookie Tour with a group of friends.  One of us had been there before and gave us a four-word review: \""Bad service.  Good food.\""  I'd say he was about three-quarters right.\n\nThe food was decent.  I got a burger (the one with blue cheese, I forget what their name for it was).  Fine but not spectacular; I wasn't particularly impressed.  The fries were good, as I would expect from a pub-y place like this.  To drink I ordered their hard lemonade and then a Black & Tan.  I enjoyed both and I thought the beer selection was quite good overall.\n\nBut the service was what really left an impression on us.  After we ordered to a surly waitress, she snapped the menus back with a frown like it was her job.  Remember that scene in Lord of the Rings where Ian Holm jumps at Frodo and his face gets all scary?  Yeah, it reminded me of that.  Then after getting our drinks we didn't see her for a good half hour, which considering her attitude I guess I wasn't opposed to until about half of us finished our glasses.  No check up, no \""anyone need another drink,\"" nothing.  After that we got our food, ordered another round of drinks and didn't see her again until she cleared the table and brought the check.  She had earlier asked how we had wanted to get the check, which we first responded with all separate but after seeing the look on her face that that request had caused we quickly changed to \""whatever's easiest for you.\"" \n\nI guess it's not a good sign when you ramble about the service at a place for twice as long as you talk about the food.  But that's just what Hambone's was for me.  The food was totally forgettable; the service was terrible.  I would've liked to go again and try something different, but I don't feel like playing \""try not to aggravate waitress\"" again anytime soon."
1,"I'm not sure why this is three and a half stars, for a buffet this place was awesome. I've only been to Home Town Buffet and some Chinese one back at my home town, so I guess it would be obvious I'd find this one above and beyond average :] \nMinus one star for the service...I really don't want to but I can't help but feel like my table was being ignored. Not only that the table next to us wasn't cleared and it wasn't pleasant sitting next to an empty, dirty, table. Not to mention we had to ask 2 people to bring us new silverware because my bf dropped his knife ;[ And it took them a while to pick up our dirty dishes, so that when I came back from getting more food there was still a dirty dish there at the table D: \nOther than that the food was delicious! I loved the selection, breakfast, lunch, dessert, sweets, veggies, seafood. All you could ask for, and they served champagne, super fancy! x3 \nI know this doesn't really matter when it comes to rating restaurants but when in line for the first time I ended up behind this really stuck up person! I assumed she was just upset about something and told myself to calm down, but what really pissed me off was when one of her friends came up to her and started a convo (which I didn't really mind I mean w/e, theres plenty of food and making a big deal out of cutting is kind of childish) and the person in front of me said, \""Yeah I don't see anyone with fruits\"" and she turned around, locked eyes with me, looked me up and down, and turned around all stuck up like!! The second I saw a break in the line I jumped ahead and got my self away from that pile of bad ju-ju. Yuck! Dx \nWhat evs, I enjoyed myself and I really liked the buffet :3"
1,"far far away from the strip, you wouldn't expect to find a quality hotel/resort/casino buffet...but that is exactly what you get at studio b.  i don't know if i'll go as far as to say that it can top an excursion to the wynn, but with half the wait time, it's well worth it.\n\nhaving once been a connoisseur of the vegas buffets, i appreciate the value of a well designed layout and variety of cuisine to choose from.  at the end of the day, every buffet will serve the same types of food...carving station, salads, sushi, americanized asian/italian/random country with a distinct palate, soups, an occasional seafood feast and dessert.  so it's fair to say that it's difficult to stand out in the buffet world of las vegas.\n\nbut that being said, studio b is successful in attracting a loyal crowd of diners and visitors.  it also doesn't hurt that m resort played host to top chef las vegas."
0,"We booked three rooms for three nights at THEhotel and here's the low-down:\n\nGOOD NEWS - \n1.  Nice rooms with lots of space, 1.5 bathrooms, comfy bed and relatively quiet.\n2.  No smoking hotel and common areas.\n3.  No three-mile walk through a brain-numbing casino to registration desk, elevators, etc.\n4.  Attentive staff, particularly our bellman (Eric?).\n\nBAD NEWS - \n1.  We booked nine nights total and one of the rooms ... literally .... faced a concrete wall!\n2.  One of our three rooms had a bathroom that had not been cleaned, at all, after the departure of the previous guest.  YUCK!\n3.  In-room coffee COSTS $4 a cup.  WTH!\n4.  You are charged if you use space in the mini-bar fridge to cool anything you bring into the room.  WTH x 2!!\n5.  Poolside seating at the Mandalay pool is FULL SUN EXPOSURE only.  If you want or need an umbrella, get out your wallet.  On the Sunday we were visiting the pool, umbrellas were available ONLY in a roped-off area with padded lounges.  Lounges were \""renting\"" for $25 each and umbrellas were renting for $50 each.  WTH x 3!!!\n6.  If you want to use the hotel's \""free\"" cardio room, get a map, a compass and put on your walking shoes.  At least you will burn calories getting to the wimpy little cardio center!  If you want anything other than the usual cardio machines, be prepared to pay for it ... $15 or $25 per day, depending on what level you want.\n\nAs Robert DeNiro points out at the end of the movie, \""Casino,\"" \n\n\""The town will never be the same. After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland. And while the kids play cardboard pirates, Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and Junior's college money on the poker slots. In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played. Today, it's like checkin' into an airport. And if you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday. Today, it's all gone. You get a whale show up with four million in a suitcase, and some twenty-five-year-old hotel school kid is gonna want his Social Security Number.\""\n\nBottom line, it's Vegas baby.  You go expecting more than you will ever get and you come away promising yourself you'll never go back.  But if you are like me, you will go again sooner or later, hoping things will be different and somehow you'll be treated like something other than what we all really are in Vegas .... cattle in the herd."

0,"I had never been to a Wing Stop before, decided to give it a try.  The taste wasn't too bad and there were enough flavor choices, but the food here is way too salty.  Probably will dine elsewhere when looking for wings next time."
0,"I have definitely had better than what this place has to offer.  First of all, the default hamburger order includes this substance they call \""chili\"" on the hamburger patty.  I think I would call it more like a mixture of tomato paste, bean paste and some sort of disgusting unknown ingredient.  Needless to say, I took about two bites and left the meal at the table for the staff to deal with.  I ordered a second burger, this time without the chili.  It was mediocre at best.  The fries were decent, however.  Had my experience with the second order been outstanding, I would have given this place a solid three stars.  I can't give them anything better than that, as my experience with the chili was too disgusting.  I would not recommend stopping in at this place for a burger and fries."
1,"BEST customer service in the world!\nSo it's Valentine's Day, traffic is terrible and I have 8:15 reservations here.  After fighting traffic and waiting in a loooong valet line, we go up to the restaurant and realized it wasalmost 9 o'clock.  Would you believe it?  On one of the busiest nights, they still held our reservations and it only takes them 15 minutes to get our table ready.  After being seated, our waiter serves us our choices on their V-day menu.  Everything tasted great, the second we finished something they took our plate, the restaurant was pretty, the view of the fountain was nice, and my wine glass never was empty until the end.  I already was thinking in my head to give it four stars (only because I thought it was just a bit over priced).  However, I ended up giving them five because of this...\n\nMy waiter came back saying what NO ONE ever wants to hear, \""I'm so sorry, but your card was declined\"".\n\nThe room went black and I died (at least that's what I wanted to happen in that moment).  Immediately, I called my bank.  After having the worst experience on the phone with my bank again (review of Chase customer service coming soon, and it won't b,pretty) and not having any way to pay, I expected the worst.  With no questions asked, the waiter and the manager informed me in the kindest manner that they'll just do a copy of the card and my ID and to not worry whatsoever, to come back tomorrow was just fine and don't let this ruin my Valentine's Day.\n\nEiffel Tower, I loved your decor, food presentation as well as taste, the live singer and nice views.  But what I loved most was the superb customer service and understanding.  Thank you for not making me feel like such a cheap skate.  Will you always be my Valentine?"
0,"Like walking into the world's largest homeless shelter.\n\nI remember visiting \""The Fremont Street Experience\"" shortly after they unveiled it with it's beautiful high-tech roof, talented street artists every block or so, and cops walking the beat. I felt safe and it was exciting.\n\nYears have passed.\n\nI paid $7.50 to park across the street. There are a few street artists there, but mostly it was assorted toothless meth heads begging for money, a guy dressed in a dirty Elmo costume, a blank-stared woman with a sign tied around her neck that read \""homeless vet's wife needs help\"", some shoeless folks sleeping in the planters, and drunk people barfing on the street. No cops, but some private \""security\"" kids huddled in groups talking and drinking their energy drinks. The concrete was sticky with some unknown substance most everywhere I walked. Merchants stand outside their shops trying to grab some unsuspecting fool and sell them a wrinkle treatment, good luck charm, novelty photo or some other useless crap. In line for a cheap hot dog, a filthy drunk guy shouted and cursed unintelligibly right next to me for the 10 minute wait. \n\nThis place is like a nightmare where nothing makes sense and it's all very frightening. I can take care of myself, but don't recommend you come here and take any chances. Unless of course you find the possibility of being knifed at any moment attractive."
0,"Well color me disappointed.\n\nDid a walk-through of the buffet about a year ago when I was visiting with my mother and it looked promising.  Really.  The only reason we didn't go was her friend didn't want to spend the $30/head to eat dinner there.\n\nFast forward to a trip I made with my boyfriend, I insisted we go.\n\nWe stood in line for probably 20 minutes, forked over our cash, and were taken to our seats.\n\nThis is a true buffet - it is just random foods that really having nothing to do with Paris.\n\nThe salad bar looked pretty rough so I skipped it.  Boo.\n\nI actually couldn't find anything that was really delicious.  I was eating just to fill up as opposed to enjoying and appreciating the food, flavors, presentation.  YES, it is a buffet, I get that, but the food tasted really boring.  Heck, the Orleans buffet blows this one away.  They boasted of their giant crab legs when we were paying (before eating), but the guy in the seafood hut told us they haven't had them in a week.\n\nThe drink lady took forever to come around.  We were finished our first plate by the time she came over.\n\nI really wanted to love this place, so much that I was willing to be pretty forgiving.  But when all was said and done, I found myself apologizing to the boyfriend for having subjected him to it.  O.O"
1,"I love this spot! It's my favorite hotel in Vegas.\n\nThis amazing hotel was carefully conceptualized. Everything from the hallway decor to the bathroom shower head was though out. Even if you are not into art, you can't help but enjoy the atmosphere. \n\nHave never made it to Mood Restaurant or the after hours as I'm always beat by the time I get back to the hotel. \n\nSome reviewers complain about noise - who goes to Vegas to sleep anyway?? I personally haven't had a problem with noise the 2 or 3 times I've stay here. \n\nCons: Only valet parking (a turn-off for some) and you can't walk right up to the strip, but it's a short drive/cab ride.\n\nI highly recommend staying at The Artisan."
1,"FABULOUS CAMBODIAN CUISINE!  \n\nJust like being on an exotic vacation tasting new flavors from top chef pretty platters in almost a Cambodian Museum .\n\nThis small restaurant is easy to miss depending on your direction driving here because the sign is only painted on one side of restaurant . Once you walk in you see a display of Cambodian relics including very old musical instruments , nick nacks  and visitor books on Cambodia on every table .\n\nOur server was very friendly and welcoming and understood we needed a little time to decide . \n\nI decided on the Loc Lak , it was pan fried beef cubes over a salad platter that came with  pickled green papaya and carrot salad , egg roll and steamed white rice . This dish was prettier than I can describe but it was also more tasty than I can describe as well . I tasted unusual flavors I never tasted before that were very good sort of tangy slightly garlic almost a mint flavor but not mint and a lingering honeysuckle note in my throat . The beef was very tender not fatty or oily one bit but it needs to be mentioned that it was a very small portion of beef my guess is two ounces . I also really enjoyed the green papaya carrot salad it was so light and fresh but also spicy , every thing on the platter was very light and fresh and a very nice meal overall .\n\nMy husband had the House Made Beef Sausage platter that also came with steamed rice , egg roll and pickled salad . This platter is a very generous serving of meat you get four sausages that are seasoned in a sweet and sour way and are very good .\n\nWe were EXTREMELY HAPPY with our visit and also spent VERY LITTLE the two meals only cost less than $20 we hope to visit again soon . Also a BYOB"
0,"I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.\n\nWe were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.\n\nWe thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.\n\nI can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.\n\nWe asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.\n\nOur waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.\n\nThe starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.\n\nThe middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.\n\nFor dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.\n\nI can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.\n\n1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star\n\nSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13\nI read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now."
0,"I went to this salon on a whim, as I was desperate to get a haircut and color before my scheduled trip. I called on a Friday, and they were able to get me in. I arrived for My appointment on time which was scheduled for 2:15, I didn't get called until 2:40. My stylist Rosie, was nice,  I explained to her what I wanted and we talked about several options on how to get there. Once we agreed on the hair color, I noticed that after she came back from mixing the color, her hands smelled like cigarette smoke. (I can't stand that smell). We talked, and she is very nice. However, I didn't like that she never once checked on me while I was sitting there with the color on my hair, until I started getting a tingling/burn feeling on my scalp.. I asked one of the other stylist if they could call her from the back. My hair looked great but the lightening in the salon isn't that great so I couldn't really see a difference in my shade. Once I got home I noticed that I a had a mess of a hair color. The top part (roots) were alot lighter than the bottom. I called to see if I could reschedule. I got an appointment scheduled for the following day, only for them to call me to tell me she had called in sick. So now I'm off on my scheduled trip looking like a skunk. Unless you are in a hurry or on a serious budget I wouldn't recommend this place."
1,"This company was great! I was given a 3hr time frame and they showed up in less than 2hrs! I wasn't there when they got there because I had no way to get there and they delivered it to the dealership and the dealership called me when it arrived! Unfortunately I needed a tow truck at the wrong time because a big flood came just the day before and another tow company left me stranded for 4hrs that night and never showed up, I wish my roadside assistance would have called this company first instead as I had to leave my car in a dark parking lot overnight. Thanks Big Boyz for rescuing my car today and providing great customer service!"
0,"Last night,hmmmm.... LAX, it was $30 for women and $50 for men, the music was off and on; I guess it was cool because it played house hip hop old and new music, BUT it played MOSTLY old stuff, and the hip hop DJ played more Jay-Z then I ever heard anybody play ever. I like me some Jay-Z but omg are you kidding me, your music line up is 95% Jay-Z!?!?... Unless you have a VIP spot there is nowhere to sit and rest, the little spot i found by the bar, all the workers and security was not having it, they wouldnt let a couple of us sit at all; so make sure you wear flats girls, there was so many in there with flip flops and sandals. We wanted to leave so bad but after paying that much money we had to stay. I would not like to go back to LAX unless I planned on getting a VIP which I most likely wouldn't with that music selection. I expected top 40 like they said but I was thinking top 40 2012/2013 not the 90's/2000, so a thumbs down and a  boooooo!!"
0,"A friend of mine moved to New York and had me ship her computer (several boxes) to her via this UPS store. I'd used this place before with no problems. Thanks to some good ol' UPS mixups one of the boxes (the actual PC) was shipped back to Phoenix, back to New York, and back to Phoenix again, ending up back at this UPS store. \n\nAforementioned friend was understandably mad and didn't want to have to pay to ship it again, called UPS and demanded they pay for it. UPS customer service agreed to and called the manager of this particular UPS store to confirm, but the manager proceeded to freak out, accused the corporate UPS employees of being 'fakes' and trying to rip him off, and held my friend's package hostage, saying he wouldn't ship it anywhere until somebody physically came into the store and gave him money to do it. \n\nSo I went in there and took the package to FedEx instead. (Which also sucked, but not nearly as much)\n\nMaybe he had good reason. Maybe he'd been ripped off by fake corporate UPS employees before. Either way, he came off like a total nut and pissed everyone off."

If you order guacamole, you can't even find it on the sandwich, let alone taste it.  They have ONE cheese selection, ONE onion selection...etc.    Why does anyone say these sandwiches are great???   They are horrible.   If you want a real sandwich go to a Deli...which out here in AZ is very rare, but then so are the good sandwiches.  Don't waste your money.

0,"Well shame on me, I thought my soft taco would look like the one on coupon ad. It showed this definitive picture of bulging cheese, eggs, salsa, and the taco dwarfed by the size of the food spilling out of the end. Hoo Ahh, I could cut off the first three inches of the taco and not touch the filling and then it was only a half inch high and two inches long. It was just a glop of egg, cheese, and the salsa was one spatter of red stuff. The \""hash browns were just old greasy flavored tatter tots. How could anyone possibly serve this stuff with a straight face? I emailed the company and they sluffed it off on the store manager. She called me and I told her the story and her answer was; well everyone advertises this way, but admitted that it was a little deceptive. Duh yuh think? She said come on in and I will buy you a breakfast to get your business back. Do me a favor and hold your breath. . . . .Check out my picture above."

1,"First time visiting Yard House and although there were a few hiccups overall I really enjoyed it. First off Steven our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable and helpful with us in navigating the large menu. They have a ridiculous amount of beer on tap and I had two of Stevens suggestions that were fantastic. \nThe food is where the experience lacked a bit. I ordered a steak salad as I wasn't too hungry my wife got the filet. Both were over cooked even though I ordered med rare and my wife medium. Both steaks were med well, but since we aren't too picky we ate them without complaint. They were OK. Honestly nothing special but good. \nThe Desert trio souffl\u00e9s were delicious and we left satisfied with our New Years eve dinner. We for sure will be back in the future."
0,Worst fine dining experience ever. The hostess was RUDE and the food HIGHLY OVERRATED. We are vegetarians and had gone with huge expectations. I am thoroughly disappointed and I am used to going fine dining at least 2 times every year. A colossal waste of $$$$ for some very average dining fare.

In that time we haven't had 30 consecutive days of uninterrupted service. Their \""routing issues\"" have been daily, and their customer support structure is dysfunctional: the only thing they seem to have mastered is the \""I'm terribly sorry for you inconvenience\"" portion of their telephone script. \nSince their latest foray into union-busting here it has only become worse. We in Vermont very much hope that our public service regulators will go after this mountain of corporate grift will all guns blazing: we've had enough of southern corporate carpetbaggers making promises they are systemically incapable of delivering on."
1,Just spent 3 nights at the Vdara.  We really liked this hotel a lot.  The hotel is smaller than the other resorts around which makes it quicker to check in and also short walks to the elevators.  Great trendy decor throughout the hotel.  We had a corner suite on the 5th floor.  Had a great view of the street and city center complex.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.  Fridge and Kurig coffee maker were a plus.  Only downside to this hotel is it is on the backside of city center and getting to the strip is a bit of a chore.  Not having a casino was not a big deal as Aria was a 2 minute walk away.  My only complaint that takes away a star is the AC in my room.  No matter what I set it to it never got cooler than 74.  We had two other guests that were with us and their rooms would cool down into the 60's.  It may have been that having large windows on 3 sides of our room and that they faced towards the west caused the room not to cool properly.  Might be something they should look at.  Also a fan in the bedroom would have been nice to.  Overall I would definitely return to this hotel.
0,"I guess I misunderstood what a museum means, because I thought it was a place where objects of value are displayed for the enjoyment of the patrons and/or public. Unfortunately, while the Writers' Museum does a great job of diving into and explaining the lives and works of several authors, but it also seems to be missing the \""we have cool stuff\"" piece that's kind of important for museum construction. Don't get me wrong, there are a few manuscripts, original works, and artifacts, but they are few and far between compared to the space spent simply quoting from or referencing the books themselves.\n\nBeing fully capable of reading, I think I'd have better spent my time simply catching up on some of these authors' classics. It might be worth a look for the devoted literature lover, especially since it's free, but I'm sorry to say I can't honestly recommend this one."
0,Well being a loyal customer sometimes has its disappointments. Today I went to Dutch Bros on Camelback and Central as this is one of my favorite places to get my usually iced beverage but I've noticed that lately they have been filling the cup all the way with ice. Last time I was there I asked for light ice and they still filled it past the half way mark. Today I requested less than half ice in my beverage because I was tired of getting half the product and paying close to five dollars for it They tried to hit me with a speech about charging me an additional fifty cents to top it off. What happened to these guys?  They use to be so good to their customers. Now it seems it's all about the profits. I remember when they first opened and I still gm there. I have spent hundreds of dollars at this establishment. Hope they make a change or I'm gonna Starbuck it again!
1,"I'll make my first review a positive one.  KO's is my families' go to restaurant.   The servers and managers are always polite and friendly.  It's a nice mix between bar and restaurant atmosphere, so my kids love it.  There are time when you wonder if your server is ever coming back, especially when they are busy, but overall, the good food, service, atmosphere and price make this a solid pick."
0,"It's hard for me to not compare a brewery to Four Peaks since FP is the best of the best, at least in Arizona. The food here was good but nothing special - I had the chicken ciabatta with aioli and bacon. The aioli sauce was sort of like barbecue mixed with mayonnaise or ranch. The bacon was really good - very thick and probably apple wood. The ciabatta was soft but not toasted and just very... not good, not bad. I probably won't be coming back but it was nice to try something new."
0,"The food here is incredible. I have eaten at this location several times, as well as the original in NewBrighton, PA. \nBUT; after today, I will never be back. \nAfter waiting 10 minutes (with a half empty dining room) for the waitress to bring me and my husband coffee, she finally took our order. 46 minutes later, I was adding yet another dollar to the meter outside, and still hungry. The waitress ignored me as I tried to find out what the issue was.  In the past, they have had issues with defrosting stuff, BUT, they always came out and explained the situation. Today, the waitress was too afraid to come and say anything. Her excuse after my husband cornered her was \""there are three tickets ahead of yours.\""  No \""sorry\"" or \""I'll fix it\"" or ANYTHING. \nTalk to me, I'm reasonable.  People around us that arrived later had their food. But all we got was a crap excuse. We left, hungry. \nAnd now, I'm upset. And I hope they fix this incompetency issue."
1,Excellent service.  They delivered on time.  Friendly and nice people.  I love my new matterass.  I will send all my friends. \n\nThanks.
1,"such a nice little place. cozy embient. \nspent 30 bucks for a whole foot massage spa package, well worth the money! love to come back next time in town."
1,"Had been waiting for them to open for a few months after following their posts on FB, etc. Went there on a Friday night after them being open for only a week. I can say it lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe menu was somewhat limited, but what they had all looked good. They started the table out with some popcorn instead of customer bread, chips, etc. It was great. I believe it was just regular popcorn with a light sprinkle of cumin. Very subtle, very good.\n\nWe had the dry rubbed wings as an app, they were also very good. \n\nFor entrees. we had the pork (pork shoulder) and shrimp (over pasta). Both were very good. The only possible negative is that the entrees ( at least some of them) don't come with any sides. The side looked good, but were ala carte.\n\nNot to be left out were the drinks. They were quite interesting - more craft than your normal fare. My wife had the Nightshade (actually two) and I had a local craft beer. All good.\n\nService was quite good, especially for a brand new place. All the inevitable kinks were worked out.\n\nOverall N&B's lived up to my expectations and is a welcome addition to South End. We'll be back regularly."
1,"The food was delicious and the service outstanding. The owner was extremely hospitable, doing everything possible to accommodate our large party and explaining all of the options available in both Chinese and English for our mixed party. \n\nVery impressive and cozy restaurant. We basically rolled ourselves out of there. Would definitely come here regularly if we could."
1,"Pet Club is a small (compared to PetSmart or Petco) pet store that has a variety  of organic items for your pets.   When going in I was expecting to find a very high price store with few items I would actually need.  To my surprise there prices are actually significantly cheaper than the chain pet stores.  They have a large variety of food for animals and many other items. The staff is very nice and seem very knowledgeable about the products that they have.  The service is 10x better than any chain pet store.\n\n  The only downside to this place is that if you are looking for something specific, it probably isn't the place to go.   They do have many different foods for animals, but for things other than food the selection is limited.\n\nOverall, I will buy my pet food/treats and some toys here, but anything else I'll go to PetSmart."
0,"Came here on a Friday night for an early dinner before a show at the Cosmopolitan Boulevard Pool.  Sat outside on the patio and was instantly greeted by our server... so we thought.  We ordered drinks and never saw her again.  Had to ask the hostess after 30 minutes if we could order some food, because our complimentary popcorn was not going to be sufficient for a night of drinking.  Our food order was taken by another server who stated there was a shift change and she would take our order for our server.  Our food was then served by another server (still not ours) who we asked for a second round from.  The second round came out by another server (finally, our server!) who completely ignored us until we had to ask(beg) him for our check. The food was bar food; which would have been ok had the service been even remotely acceptable, which it wasnt. I did leave there happier than the man who got a glass of sangria dumped on him by his server though. What a mess."
1,The Baristas rock here! I stop in on my way to work and they are always so happy and caffeinated.  Super friendly staff!
0,"We are on Vegas for a Dj Tour. Yesterday we discovered this amazing place!! The food is delicious! Yesterday Judy actually walked outside & told us the food was great and to try it out. We came in not knowing who she was. It wasn't till later that the waitress told us who she was. By the way our waitress was amazing. Her & Judy are the reason we came back.\n\nToday however I'm extremely upset. My appetite went away. Our waitress Toni, I asked her name so I'm hoping she didn't lie. She was extremely rude & NOT helpful. The $50 of food we ordered came, we asked for sides of ranch & BBQ and she charges us, we were not charged yesterday. I asked why the wings are dry and she had the nerve to say \""I didn't cook it\"" really? So I asked \""if you can't ask the cook I definitely don't mind asking\"" she rolled her eyes and asked of extra sides were okay.  I'm sorry but I thought I was paying for food & service? \n\nI'm never coming here again & better believe this waitress got NO TIP. We took all our food to go. \n\nSad that I didn't have time to leave a review yesterday. And upset that this poorly educated waitress ruined my experience at Radio City Pizza.\n\nSorry Jodi. Place is great. Food is delicious. However customer service can make or break an experience. Toni should be behind a cash register or washing dishes not ruining people's lunch with her attitude."
0,"Pretty classic corporate franchise, 6 ppl in line, 1 person serving and 2 employees taking a break during peak time. Enough time for me to write this review while I'm standing in line."
1,"Great decor\nDelicious food\nWonderful service\n\nWhen I go on yelp I want to know what people ordered and if it was palatable. \nSo I'll start with the best dish!!!\nThe sweet potato donuts are AMAZING!\nI'm going to try not to sneak back down later this evening for my very own plate :) make sure you save room for those. Or start with them. Might as well insure you have room.\nFor dinner...\nWe ordered the filet rare. It was tender and delicious. \nThe fish of the day was sea bass and it was buttery with a crispy outer layer. Amazing!\nWe ordered 4 sides\nThe creamed corn, my husband said it was his favorite. It was a little more like a souffl\u00e9 in my opinion. Good taste, sweet but a little fluffy, not like southern creamed corn.\nMashed potatoes- Creamy and delicious.\nMacaroni and cheese- Flavorful.\nBroccolini- tasty.\nThe other dessert we had was the pana cotta. Hmmm, not great, sadly. \n\nThe sides were good. Not to die for but yummy. Usually the sides have me oohing and awing. The main courses were very yummy. \nThis was probably my 2nd time here in Vegas and we probably dine at the LA location yearly. So I'm sure we will be back. \nIt's a great restaurant for special occasions. I love the atmosphere, very fun.\nBy the way, we weren't able to get a reservation but if you go to the first seating at 6 they can easily accommodate you."
0,"Although Jennifer was cordial and a pleasure to do pre-planning arrangements with (ie: how many of this/that, what we need, etc.) I was not very impressed with how she conducted business on our wedding date. Our wedding was 150 people, in Beaver Dam, and in my parents back yard. I supplied everything for them (aside from mixing utensils). \nMy father expressed concern regarding underage drinking and over-intoxication. I understand he had requested that IDs be checked for those appearing to be underage. This is not an unusual request and was part of the reason we'd hired a bartender to handle alcohol rather than have a liqueur buffet. However, requesting the ID of my grown, adult guests repeatedly throughout the night became an issue. By \""became an issue\"", I mean that myself, the groom and our parents were receiving countless complaints from our obviously-adult guests that they were being refused service at the bar or they felt as though they were treated rudely. A specific situation would be she requests to see the IDs of my grandparents (they're 70+ years old) or our aunts and uncles who are well into their 40s. In fact, looking back at my guest list, there were 16 underage children (not teens) at the wedding. The issue persisted throughout the evening, concluding in my father and the groom having to tell her to ease-up 3 different times. \nI understand that we hired her and her colleague for the better part of the day. I understand that we hired them both over 2 mealtimes. I made it a point to pass-the-word along that vendors were welcome to help themselves to a plate of food before the caterer left. However, I did not expect that she would serve herself food prior to all of the guests eating and seat herself amongst them. That was not professional in the least. I didn't notice it, but my guests did and they've brought it up to me numerous times. \nBiggest issue that baffled me was her telling guests (my bridesmaids, groomsmen, and our parents included) that we were all out of various sodas and other alcohol by the end of the night; however, when cleaning up the next day, we carried 20+ 2-liters and 10+ bottles of alcohol out of the ice trailer.  We did not run out of a single thing other than cups. I do not understand why she would tell people we were out of those items. A specific example, we bought a ton of diet soda because there were 3+ guests that are diabetic. One of those guests approached the groom at around 10p stating he was told there was no more diet soda. We had some; we're still finishing 2-liters that were left over today. \nShe refused service to one of my dearest friends while the groom was ordering her a shot. We bought a special $50 bottle of gluten-free vodka exclusively for her that went to waste because she over-asserted herself. She then proceeded to give the groom himself a mini-sobriety test when he was ordering (ie: asking rapid-fire, unrelated questions, paying close attention to his answer/response time). Guests complained to me about her rudely refusing service unless they brought their original cups back. I understand we ran out a few times, but we had enough (and continuously brought her more) that she didn't need to be turning people down. \nOn the other hand, we received nothing but compliments regarding her colleague's composure and professionalism throughout the night. In conclusion, hearing the feedback we've received from our guests since the wedding I was unsatisfied with the quality of service she provided. I will not be recommending her business to others."
0,"While the atmosphere, food, and drink were beyond expectations, the service left a lot to be desired. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated badly. The hostess was rude to us and then our waitress was also rude.\n\n There were several open tables, but service was slow. 30 minutes to get drinks when we had a clear view of them sitting on the bar. My friend politely told the waitress that she thought she had been given the wrong beer. Her response was, \""No, that's what you ordered!\"" I have really never been treated like this anywhere in my life. \n\nOverall, I don't want to go back, but may give it a second chance. I don't see this place making it past 1 year."
0,So I finally made it out here last night and I would say the artist (Diplo) was AMAZING but the establishment has a lot to work on. Not planning on going back  again.\n\nPRO: -free champagne for for ladies with a wristband from 11-12.\n\n-bartenderd were nice\n\nCONS: - kept continuously changing the guys guest list price\n- setup is literally around encore beach club with the pool area separating the room with the main stage and bar area which is just awkard\n- tooooooooo packed. The room with the stage is like a thing long hall with a few dancers posted on poles. The group we went with couldn't handle the pushes and shoves and complete lack of space and left the dance floor soon after we go there. There was constant shoving and elbows. I'm used to crowds so I stuck it out for diplo but they all were very dissapointed\n- staff was rude and unhelpful. Rather than helping people who were being pushed they literally kicked a girl out for standing her ground
1,"Love, love, love this place!  The food is amazing, the presentation is so artsy, great variety, the service is great!   Note to self, never book a show after the dinner here because 1.  Will be on time constrain so cant fully enjoy everything they have, 2. Will be too stuffed to run to the show once we are late by spending too much time nibbling n the deliciousness."
0,"This place is AWFUL, just horrific! I wish I never gave them any of my money!! If they weren't at such a prominent position, I really don't know how they can survive in Vegas given there is such good eats elsewhere. \n\n$14 for a cup of gelato, the smallest size available for adults. The server took the courtesy (ha!) to flatten the gelato so I only got the same volume as the cup. I've had gelati in Roma and for that price I'd have gotten 3 big cones worth. \n\nI wouldn't have been so mad if it was good gelato - but of course, it was very, very ordinary. Should have triggered something when they have flavors like Snickers and Reece's Pieces... as oppose to Tiramasu or dolce de leche."
0,"Read alot of reviews from Rice Paper before going there.  It is an old house, remodeled inside for seating about 30 people. It was loud inside and uncomfortable seating was the first impression for we had chose a high top table. There was also outside seating.  I was excited to try the Pho based on the several outstanding reviews I read.  I do know now that all reviews were not on the RicePaper site, since there were no bad reviews.  My girlfriend ordered pho tai and I had the pho mignon. The first taste was ok, but we both agreed that the soup was saltier than other Vietnamese restaurants.  The meat was tender with a faint metallic taste.  The rice noodles were good, but a skimpy portion left me wanting more. We had the spring roll with chicken breast, and it was ok, but only half the size for a higher price than the best competitors in town.  We eat Vietnamese food three times a week on average, and not mentioning the service at Rice Paper(because its below par) we could not wait to erase Rice Paper from our three a week Vietnamese fix.  Overall the attraction is location, but there is hardly any parking available behind the house"
1,"My favorite affordable sushi place in the city.  I love the people that work there (they are very friendly) and their new storefront (2032 Murray; just one block up the hill from their old location) is bigger and in better shape, making the atmosphere very pleasant.  I believe it is owned and run by a Japanese family, which is a rarity in Pittsburgh and results in high quality sushi.  I have been coming here for years and even though I've had a couple of not amazing meals for the most part everything has been everything I hoped.  Sushi is my comfort food and Chaya is the place I go for it."
1,"Want to visit Africa in Phoenix? Head to 7th Ave. and Campbell for authentic West African food in a small and warm setting.\n\nLocated in what could have been any one of countless styles of restaurant before becoming Bantu Bistro, this intimate eatery offers African fare that is accessible to even the most timid eaters.\n\nFor starters, Bantu offers hot wings, tomato fried chicken and one other chicken dish that I cannot recall. The remainder of the menu is comprised of a variety of African stews and meat dishes that can be made with goat, chicken or beef. I had the groundnut stew (basically spicy peanut soup) with goat (per our lovely waitress's recommendation) and was not disappointed. With my stew, I chose a side of fufu (basically a mix of potatoes and cornmeal that tasted something like instant mashed potatoes without enough milk). When i put some of the soup on top of the fufu for flavoring, it became more enticing (nevertheless I might order the potatoes, rice or plantains for a side if I were to return). The goat, if you have never enjoyed this meat, was something like a tougher version of lamb. The Bistro does not list any desserts on its menu, but I did not inquire about it either. I have difficulty remembering anything on the menu that was more than $9. My friend and I had two stews with goat, a starter of tomato fried chicken and two imported beers. Our total, with tax, came to $33.\n\nService was attentive and friendly. Upon leaving, the chef/owner (who has lived in the Valley for a number of years after moving from Africa) greeted my entire party, shook our hands and promised to provide us with a special treat (some sort of beans, he said) upon return. I'll be looking forward to it!"
1,"Went straight from work to check out Mekong Plaza last night after chatting with coworker \""JJ\"" about the good deals she found there.  She was able to find her fave brand of rice, grapes, garlic, and other items.  She was lamenting that she only had twenty minutes to look around; she therefore allowed herself to buy those items she knew cost less here than at Lee Lee.  After she'd listed off what she had paid $53 for, I told her she should count her blessings that she only had those few minutes to shop!  I asked her if she preferred it over Lee Lee, and while she liked the newness of the place and the lower costs of some items, she didn't like how items in the produce section were plastic-wrapped; she liked being able to hand-pick her veggies and fruits.  Another coworker had mentioned the plaza's opening to me days prior and had piqued my interest the moment she uttered the words, \""there are five restaurants...\""  I was getting hungry while JJ and I chatted, so there was no question where I was heading to after clocking out.\n\nAs I pulled into the almost empty parking lot at around 8:20p, I noticed that the entrance doors were flagged by two restaurants- one called MyLynn Cafe that was still open for business, and the other looked like a coffee shop that was already closed for the day.  I grabbed a menu from MyLynn (beverages that included fountain, coffee, and smoothies, $5 or less, and a page of chef's specials of about 8 or so items, soups mostly, $5-10) intending to stop here after my pit stop at the grocery.\n\nThis building is HUGE!  I saw white everywhere I looked- floors, statues, and walls.  Most lots (indoor shops) were still unoccupied, and I was beginning to think I may never find the grocery store as all I could see where closed shops (dentistry, jewelry store, a movie rental shop, etc) and more restaurants.  When coworkers mentioned there were a few eateries in place, I expected to encounter a layout similar to that of Whole Food's (Ray/101), so this building really threw me for a loop- walking around MP actually felt like I was perusing through one of the mini-malls back home (Philippines).  Thinking it over just now, I also remember malls in NJ that had similar layouts.  But I digress... I spotted two \""opening soon\"" food-court type sections for Korean and Japanese food before turning the corner and finding two more Vietnamese restaurants (Vietnamese Restaurant and Un-pho-gettable).  These venues stood right across from the grocery store.  Finally, I reached my destination!  Before investigating the grocery, I entered Un-pho-gettable and skimmed through their extensive menu and saw the entree prices ranged from around $8 to $20 or more.  I asked a person who seemed like the manager what time they closed.  He replied usually 8p, but if it's busy then they would close at 8:30p.  I told him that if they were still open, I would return shortly.\n\nA quick glance around MP revealed large seafood, meats, and refrigerated sections (not counting those refrigerated aisles that wrapped around the back of the store).  Indeed, these three departments occupied a third of the grocery.  Don't quote me on this, but I think that the produce department was also a part of that section, but I wasn't looking for fruits or veggies that night.  I was on the hunt for the Filipino aisle, specifically for brands of peanut butter other than Lily's, which is the only brand to be found at Lee Lee.  Unfortunately, I only found the one brand, which is $0.20 less here.  I did, however, find PRESERVATIVE-FREE jackfruit and macapuno (\""coconut sport\"") strings (two delicious components of a nectarous icy snack/beverage called halo-halo).  \n\nTo keep this review from tiring the both of us, I will wrap it up by saying that I will definitely be back to have another longer look around the aisles, which did not seem as country-specific as Lee Lee's.  It does reverberate highly with me already bec. I found those last two items.  What else would I find??  I'm brimming with anticipation!  \n\nBTW, since the pho place was already closed by 8:40p,  I decided to try the one next door, which had a Vietnamese title and ended with \""Vietnamese Restaurant.  Review will be posted shortly."
1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE hulas. Their food is so good. I always get the ahi tacos. Spicy and delicious. The prices are super reasonable. The staff is always so friendly. Great atmosphere.\n\nMy favorite part is the dog friendly patio :) I always bring my pup to hang out on the patio (we call it Yappy Hour) and our server always brings out a bowl of water immediately for her!\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone for great food, service and atmosphere."
1,"The best pizza in Las Vegas!! This New York style pizzeria makes New Yorkers jealous. They use the right amount of sauce unlike the commercial pizza companies they try to drown you in it. I always get the pepperoni because is just the right amount of everything. The guys are friendly and always greet me by name when I come in. It is always a great show to watch Kenny \""spin\"" a pizza...it is a lost art form."
1,"I have always had an amazing meal at Dinette. I've only tried their pizzas, which their  menus change periodically. But everyone I've tried have been very good!\n\nAs for the rest of their menu, first, they have those \""cracker bread sticks\"" on the table, which nobody ever likes so they should get rid of them. Also, I tank they only serve sodas by the can and not by fountain. But I have the impression that they have a pretty good beer selection.\n\nParking is very easy because it is in a large lot that is shared with Chipotle, T-Mobile, a bike place, and others.\n\nOverall, definitely high quality pizza and one of my go-to places!"
1,"Not only are their bagels delicious, but they have THE BEST COFFEE in the valley, hands down.  Add a touch of cream and a little sweetener to their hazelnut vanilla brew or their breakfast blend for a slightly less sweeter version and it's practically HEAVEN in cup.  I'm not kidding.  I am a serious coffee drinker (couldn't tell ,could you?) and I am very picky.  So picky that before I discovered Lox, I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough.  However, now that I have had the glorious coffee from Lox Stock & Bagel even my own coffee doesn't measure up.  I literally stop by and pick up a cup from there almost every day. YUMMMM!"
1,"This is the greatest optical shop ever! Bob and Libby are both knowledgeable about their field and expert at fitting and adjusting eyeglasses. They are both personable and helpful to the max! \n\nThe selection of frames is excellent, and they are so familiar with the inventory that they can immediately pick out a frame that looks good and fits the customer's needs.\n\nThanks, Bob and Libby, for the excellent service!"
1,"I'm ready to move to Phoenix to be closer to my new love, Dick's Hideaway.\n\nThanks Phoenix yelpers for directing me to the mother of all whole-in-the-walls.\n\nI ordered the first thing I saw on the menu, Pasta Heidi, which is green chile linguine with grilled chicken in a chipotle cream sauce.  It was so good, I'd like to move to Phoenix and get a job at Dick's, just for the employee meal.  I'll have to settle for a few more meals there before we leave town, because my husband thinks I'm being ridiculous.  I blame Dick's.\n\nCan't wait to try their breakfast AND lunch.\n\nSee you tomorrow Dick's Hideaway.\n\nLove Mary-Anne"
1,"This is a really nice theatre. I like that you can choose your seats when you buy your tickets online beforehand, so you know where you'll be sitting and you'll have a seat with your party. The seats also recline and have foot rests, as well as trays for food. It was really comfortable watching a movie there. It was very clean, as well - no sticky floors or trash leftover from the previous showing. My only suggestion would be to illuminate the walkways and seat numbers, at least until the movie starts, so that you can see where you're going. I had to use the flashlight on my cell phone to find my seat. Other than that I was very happy with the experience and I'd definitely go back!"
1,"While I was here for a CMYE (where they served some delicious fare) I also took some time and carried out from Mama Fu's. \n\nInside Mama's is bright and colorful with ample table space and even a comfy booth if you're waiting for your food to go. Employees are all very sweet, smiley and helpful. It's especially nice to see how many regulars they have here! I noticed the manager greeting many of them by first name. Sweet! \n\nItems you must try:\n\nBasil spring rolls: 4/5: Very fresh and healthy rolls accompanied by great peanut sauce. \n\nLettuce wraps: 5/5: I have so many friends that swear by PF Changs' lettuce wraps but these would challenge them! Flavorful chicken diced with a myriad of spices envelopes in a large piece of lettuce. That's what dreams are made of, friends. \n\nSpecial crunchy noodle dish: 3/5: This dish was a special for the evening - a mammoth portion of crunchy (fried? saut\u00e9ed?) noodles with carrots, snap peas and chicken. The flavors were well rounded and I loved the idea of a crunchy noodle. The issue on this one was the carry out as the sauce took much away from the crunch as I traveled home. Regardless, I would definitely order this again if I was eating in house! \n\nNext time I'm in Cotswold and hear my stomach a rumblin' I'll definitely get my Fu fix!"
1,Friendly staff.\n\nGreat selection.\n\nI've already got two cats but I can't help checking out the cats up for adoption.  I always pray they find great forever homes and can't help but leave with a tear that I can't take them all.  But I'm not ready to be the cat lady just yet and was told if I have more than two cats I'm undateable.\n\nI always give extra money for their pet adoption/care thing.  Makes me feel better.
1,"I came here early sunday, 11:15. The place was almost empty, I got a table right away. I had a Boston tea(like a Arnold Palmer but with cranberry), it was pretty good. Service was prompt and attentive yet not overbearing and annoying. I ordered the crab steamer pot, crab, shrimp, corn cob, potatoes, and scallops. The crab was crisp shelled, sweet and tender. The shrimp was yummy and cleaned well. The sauce that it all came in(butter and white wine) was rich and delicious. The scallops were well done and not gritty. The potatoes were quartered and had a great crispy crust that absorbed the sauce well. My only complaint wad that the corn was a bit over done for my taste, but I like mine very crunchy. The cheddar bay biscuits were great and bottomless to boot. When I left the place was packed! Get here early! My check was 24$ and I left happy, full, and satisfied. If yer not a seafood snob and you realize that yer in the middle of the desert, try this place for a reasonable priced and above average seafood meal."
1,I have try this place again today Sunday night and the service was much better. Getting served by the GM awesome service and food.
0,"The pizza is overpriced, as is everything else. Also, the food isn't good. The salads weren't fresh and the pizza lacks taste. Fortunately for you, Sorento's is nearby as are several other better pizza places. Service and atmosphere however, are excellent."
1,Oh Pizza Mart. You were our go to place when I was a little girl growing up in Mesa. How can you beat the delicious CHEAP large pepperoni pizzas for $3.75 (back in the '80's and '90's). Then a 10 cent ice cream cone. You had the best old school video games ever. You are a true Mesa landmark!
0,"Came here late night last Friday night, worse decision of my life!  This place has the worst service!!!  We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.  On top of that the .25 wings was a total bait and switch, plus they weren't that good anyways.  AVOID THIS PLACE WITH YOUR LIFE.  I'll never return to this dump."
0,"We went on a Sunday when they had some specials going on. $6 wings and $6 chilli fries. They also had all taps for $2. The place was not to busy and we were greeted promptly and sat at the bar. \n\nI ordered wings and a Diego Burrito. The wings were good. They were large and crispy but not a lot of flavor. I had the garlic chorizo sauce, I guess I was just expecting more of a kick from either of those two ingredients,. The burrito fell apart as soon as my fork dug into it. Again, not a lot of flavor. Actually, the burrito was just bland. The special price on the wings was worth it but the burrito was not sadly. I will go back to try some different things and update this when I do. \n\nThe saving grace of this establishment was the bartender. Very friendly and super upbeat. That being said check out their daily specials. They have some good drink ones and it would be worth it to go. Also a large selection of tequila and margaritas."
0,"Normally I avoid Tempe Marketplace at all costs, especially on a Saturday night, but a friend insisted on going because he said it was really good food in large portions.  Apparently not so anymore.  Four of us split the Lucille's Appetizer Platter which is basically a sampling of all of the appetizers.  This was good, but then again it's hard to go wrong with fried food.  It's the meat that they really screwed up on.  I ordered the tri tip sandwich, which I describe as slices of beef jerky on a dried out potato bun with a little BBQ sauce.  Funny thing is, beef jerky is exactly how a friend described his steak, which he ordered to be cooked medium and it came out well done.  The only meat that anyone ordered that was moist and tasty was the chicken.  The service wasn't the best.  We were promised biscuits but we had to remind one of the four different servers we had that they still hadn't come out more than halfway into our meal.  Maybe it was just a bad night for dry, overcooked meat, but given the location, prices and lack of stellar service, I definitely won't be returning."
0,"You know times are really getting bad when a shop like Meineke pulls this stuff. I have been getting my oil changed at Meineke for the last few years because they mail me oil change specials for $15.95. Yesterday ended all that. I went in yesterday (Saturday) to get my oil changed even though I figured I may have to wait because it's Saturday. There were no other customers there at 10:00 AM. I gave them my coupon and the keys and said I was going next door and would be back in 20 minutes. When I came back the manager said he had some bad news for me. He said I needed a power steering and brake fluid flush because the fluids were dirty. I said OK, show me the leak. He said there is no leak and I said no s**t, if there was I would have noticed it on the floor in my garage. Then I asked him if there was no leak how did my fluids get dirty? He sounded like Obama without a teleprompter, uh, uh ooo, uh, ahh, oh, oh. Then he told me I needed a fuel filter because the one that was on there looked like the original. I told him it was not the original, I replaced the original at 40,000 miles because my engine started to ping. Restricted filter and the engine runs lean, gets hot and pings. I put in a new one and no more ping. Then he told me I needed battery service because the posts were starting to show some corrosion that will cause my battery to drop cells. I told him the battery was $39.95 purchased at Walmart 5 years ago and was probably ready to be replaced anyway. He said he could perform all this service today for $279.95 and he would throw in the oil change for free. I got up on my tip toes and did a tap dance while shouting expletives as loud as I could that would have made Rodney King proud."
1,"Steve is awesome!!  There are so many \""deals\"" out there on Groupon, Living Social, etc for carpet cleaning, but what they forget to mention is all the add-in's you need.  You think you are getting a good deal, but in the long run you aren't.  Steve is the best out there and you won't have to worry about him trying to sell you anything.  It's upfront, honest, reliable, on-time and does an outstanding job.  I have now used him 2 times and this time I had him clean my couches.  Everything just smells and looks amazing.  I highly recommend Carpet MD for your carpet needs!"
1,"So many amazing things about this spot! Let's start with the quaint location. It isn't some huge chain Italian restaurant. It's a small spot with inside and outside seating (of course, the outside is still technically inside since it's in the Venetian.) We were seated immediately and multiple servers greeted us and made sure we were taken care of. I ordered the special: cheese ravioli with roasted tomato marinara and fresh buffalo mozzarella. INCREDIBLE. My husband had the pesto gnocchi--also incredible!! The garlic rolls that came out before our entrees were delicious. They were warm and cheesy and served with balsamic vinegar and oil. Our meal, start to finish, took no longer than 40 minutes. I was impressed by the service, the food, and the whole experience."
1,"Fantastic meal, excellent service, nice ambiance.  I will definitely return!"
0,"Seriously let down by this place...\n\nI ordered two Chicago dogs and they were pretty lackluster. The buns themselves were soggy, the peppers were HUGE and awkward to eat. The fries were decent and the shake was ok (strawberry). \n\nSadly this place is supposed to be known for their hotdogs, and they fell pretty flat here. \n\nI won't be coming back to this place anytime soon..."
0,"Horrible Service\n\nAlways looking for a good breakfast/brunch place. After reading all the positive reviews on Yelp, decided to give it a try, last Sunday around 2:30pm. \n\nThe quality of the food was good, the prices are a little high. But what isn't these days. The problem I had was with the service. First the waitress couldn't tell my wife what was on the Miyagi burger. So my wife decides on the short rib and I had the pocho breakfast. The waitress asks my wife how she wants her eggs cooked but doesn't ask me. \n\nOnce the food was brought out, my wife requested additional napkins, which were never brought out. We didn't see the waitress again until 20 minutes later. She didn't stop by to ask if everything was ok, or if we needed refills on our drinks. She was behind the bar, doing whatever she was doing. Finally a different waitress stopped by with our check. \n\nWhile we were eating, a lady came into the restaurant, and waited by the reception area, which no one was at. She read the menu for 10 minutes, and when no one showed up to seat her, she finally gave up and left. \n\nMaybe they were just having a bad day. But the restaurant was only about 1/4 full. \n\nWill I go back, I will probably give then one more try."
1,"Best haircut I have ever received, Pittsburgh or otherwise.  Ryan obviously has a love for what he does and an eye for style.   All this and the price is right.  Walk-ins only,so you might have to wait for someone to finish, but that was not my experience."
1,"To be, or not to be.... Yeah you gotta go here!\n\n1.  Big reason - HUGE seats, lots of leg room, BIG Screens.\n\n2.  Food - Same stuff as anywhere, and they have free popcorn flavoring in case there is not enough sodium in your diet anyway. The stuff is ADDICTING!!!!\n\n3.  Ambiance - Trendy, comfortable, just the right amount of busy.\n\n4.  Parking - Outdoor mall, parking requires a small walk.\n\n5.  Otherness - All the restaurants, bars, and walking areas make this place a really cool place to be and to walk around. \n\n6.  Selection of movies - Awesome!\n\nI say check it out.  Very cool..."
0,"Extremely overrated. Been trying to go here for a long time but refused to wait hours to get in. Expected the best pizza ever from all the hoopla. Pizza was good, not great. Overpriced for sure ($21 & $16) with limited toppings available. Also very sparse on the toppings too. Small salad was $9. Much better pizzas and variety at Humble Pie, Rare Earth Wine Bar or Oregano's. We came, we tried, and we won't be back."
0,"Typical late night college pizza.  Not bad, but not good.  Slow delivery."
0,This place is closed for business
1,Taking a few sessions in the summer from STEM Force Technology and loving the place - enjoying the collaboration between students.
1,"My husband and I just returned from dinner at bootleggers & it was awesome! The brisket is one of the best we have ever tried, we even took an order to go! Highly recommend that as well as the apple moonshine.\nOur server, Marcus, was knowledgable and courteous. He deserves a raise ;)\nThank you for a great experience and we will return."
1,"Hands down, the BEST hotel I have stayed in in Vegas. Possibly anywhere. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.\n\nFirst, the only parking is complimentary valet parking. Which is awesome. And makes you feel pretty legit, especially when you're not swanky enough to usually valet park your car. \n\nThe girl that checked us in was very nice and very helpful. She made light conversation with us and was very polite. All of the staff that we came in contact with were the same way. And I really appreciated when we came in late one night, that they were checking everyone's room keys before they could get on the elevators. \n\nThe hotel lobby was beautiful and well-kept. I really appreciated that there wasn't a casino attached because it made everything look that much classier and nicer. \n\nWe just got the standard room but it was HUGE. King-sized bed, more closets than I have in my house, a kitchenette with a sink, mini-fridge, toaster, etc., and a sitting area with a couch and two chairs. And the BATHROOM. I have never in my life seen a bigger hotel room bathroom. A shower that could have easily fit ten people, a walled off area for the toilet, double sinks, a HUGE jetted tub, and a TV IN THE MIRROR. I felt like a queen. \n\nThe only problem we had was the reception on the TV. About every three minutes, the picture would freeze and would stay that way for another minute or two. But when you're in Vegas, you don't spend much time laying around watching TV, so it wasn't a huge deal. \n\nI fully plan on returning to this hotel whenever I'm in Vegas. And I HIGHLY recommend staying here."
0,**Review only on the Horchatta***\n\nCame here drunk one night during our spring break vacation. It was kind of hard to find since our GPS lead us to an apartment complex. We finally managed to find it after we got out of the apartment complex...it's literally in front of that and next to a gas station. \n\nWe went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.\n\nMy horchata was cheap and delicious...very refreshing and cinnamony. It was a little to sweet for my liking so I couldn't finish it all but it was still pretty good.
1,"This is one of those places that folks get to know each other by name and you see the same faces every week. NORM!! Really, they're sweet locals here.\n\nI come for karaoke, mainly because the host isn't so ego driven that he sings every rotation or adds long, boring hip-hop vignettes between sessions that make a short rotation take hours and force you to leave after singing one song. (like *some* places I'll never return to *cough*Blind Tiger*cough*)...instead, you get a sweet mixture of the die-hard karaoke ilk that either sing pretty good or suck up the joint - and you get to sing at least 2-3 times before your second drink.\n\nThe place is never crowded, and it's not that smoky, surprisingly.\n\nThe bartender is a sweetheart who remembers you and what you sang when you even you've only been there a couple of times.\n\nMy only complaint is that they don't take plastic. Who carries cash in this millennium? Yes, they have an ATM, but for those fees, I'd rather just drink water."
0,"Maybe because I live in New York, it's hard for me to take a store like this seriously.  It carries a weird vibe I've seen in smaller cities where shop assistants think high-end stuff and a sense of humor are mutually exclusive.  Everyone's very s-e-r-i-o-u-s.  Lighten up, people.  It's clothing.  It's meant to be fun.  And, honestly, some of the clothes you stock are a bit silly."
1,Stopped in last night. Moved close by recently. Some of the poor reviews on here held me back from trying the place. It was fun place to go patrons were friendly and the bar tender Steph made everyone fell welcome and great service. I will go back.
0,"Nothing for kids to play with while they wait!!  \n\nI don't understand how this place has so many stars. I came in with my 2 year old with an appt at 4:40...the place was busy and I could see I would have to wait...that was fine but there was nothing for kids to play with while they are waiting...no books, toys or anything. So while I try to keep my squirmy child waiting, none of the staff acknowledge me, reassure me that I will be served soon. After 10 minutes, which to a 2 year old might as well be 1 hour, and no acknowledgment from the staff my son got increasingly more riled up...i had to leave. The staff could care less...and when I complained their attitude was \""fine, leave\"".  For $18.95...you need a little more than a DVD player and one of those cars...how about a more attentive attitude and a waiting area appropriate for a young child."
0,"THIS IS ONE I REALLY SHOULD HAVE READ N YELP BEFORE...\n\nIt took 3 tries for us to finally make it here.-\n\nThe 1st time the players club line was 100 people long,so we left.\n2nd time we got the card but the buffet line was ridiculous, so we left.\n\nThis time I forgot my card so ONLY the card holder gets the discounted buffet-otherwise its $14.99!!\n\nIt is a small buffet--the food is bland & boring, hardly any desserts and Self-serve drink station with PEPSI products,coffee,tea and milk.\n\nThe carving station had a turkey end & a beef ends(at 6pm mind you-acted like they didn't have more)\n\n There was nothing special,very limited choice Its salad fixins &----salisbury steak,bbq chicken,bbq ribs,tacos,spaghetti,pizza,and sides like mashed potatoes,green beans and corn.\n\nok so for $8.99 w/players card it pretty cheap for a dinner buffet (you get what you pay for)BUT....FOR $14.99 WAY OVERPRICED.\n\nThis definitely goes in my BOTTOM 5 Buffets in Las Vegas"
1,"Stayed here for my last night in Vegas. The hotel/casino, although nice, overall had a cheesy feel to it. A lot of gold and lions. That said, we stayed in a recently remodeled room that had a chic, European flair to it that we just loved. There was a tv in our bathroom mirror! Front desk was very friendly and helpful. Definitely a good option when in Vegas. I noticed more families here than at other hotels."
1,"Good quality.  Long lines.  Is it worth the wait and price - yes.  But as any other buffet, you get sick of it after 2 times.\n\nPros:\n- Trip Tip, Ribs, Soft Tacos, Seafood, Steam crab legs (Snow Crabs, not king crab though)\n- A good variety Desserts, Mochi ice cream (seasonal)\n- Fresh oysters\n- Good Chinese food selection (I like the thousand year old egg porridge)\n- Delicious Coffee\n\nCons: \n- No King Crab Legs (Bellagio's Buffet has king crab legs)\n- No Caviar (Bellagio has this)\n\n\nOverall - I think the food quality is a notch better than Bellagio's Buffet and right on par with Wynn"
0,"I am extremely disappointed! I was surprised at how fast they were done and after doing a quick walk around my car I pointed out numerous areas missed. It was as if he never wiped down the outside! It was so ridiculous and I was so aggravated that I said \""Whatever, forget it\"" then tipped the bare minimum and left. I will not go back."
0,Like the family owned business and I'm all for mom and pops places.. Bt I have to say its totally greasy..... Sorry not again....
0,"This review is for the company all together. I live in austin, texas and there is no stores like this around here. So i order online... As all of you know these clothes are pretty pricey - so why is it I spent over 120 on an outfit and the following happens:\n\npackage is delivered. yay, really excited!!! i open the package, pull out the bow print shirt - two buttons fly off immediatly from removing from the package... kinda pissed - but i got my shirt and thats an easy sew. buttons back on.  take out the high waisted black shorts - love them! i say to myself \""tonight i am going to rock out with this cute ass outfit!\""...\n\nlater that night - another button falls off.. not one of the two that i had sewn on already - so a new button...screw it - deal with it later... i go to the restroom and the zipper gets stuck - i try being gentle an  show the zipper a little love while i worry that its not budging. VIOLA - the zipper had its own plan - it broke completely! i was in the bathroom for 10 minutes trying to fix the zipper in the stall. no can do - completely busted. so now im walking around with no button on the breast part of my shirt and my high waisted shorts completely open looking like white trash.. i was nearly in tears and so embarrassed i had wear a stupid cardigan all night to cover everything up in the wonderful texas heat!\n\ni also have a few dresses from the site that somehow a 5'2 bernie dexter wore perfectly (as she always does cause shes beautiful - but thats besides the point) but when they arrive to my body theyre ridiculously long! and im 5'3... shouldnt they be a bit shorter? so now my 130 dollar dress cost an extra 25 to be hemmed.\n\nthe fabric on all my clothes from bettie page clothing are cheap. i kept giving the company the benefit of the doubt but after my disastrous night out - never ever will i ever order from them again.\n\nand by the way - i wore the bowtie shirt again last night - guess whos sewing a button on right now? yep - that would be me. i have one original button left."
1,I've been meaning to try the French Grocery for a while now. Finally checked it out a few weekends ago and have been back three times since. The pot roast sandwich with a side of pomme frites is incredible and made for a great post Halloween hangover cure. The croissants are easily the best I've had and all of the sweets that I've tried have been perfect also.
0,"Don't eat here way over priced. $15 for 3 asparagus spears, 2 tbsp. of spinach and 4 tiny slices of tuna. Go down the street to Rachel's kitchen much more bang for your buck."
1,"AMAZING! I have had massages before but none like this, I found this place on groupon and everyone warns me that you get what you pay for but Jesse was simply amazing. There were some points during the massage where I couldn't tell where he was standing and it felt like he had 6 hands. Might sound too good to be true but my stuff shoulders feel great, I will defiantly be returning!"
1,"Salvatore's is HERE IN MADISON! Woohoo, the Yelp favorite pizza is here!! Let's cheer! No more driving to Sun Prairie for Salvatores!\n\nI was surprised by the size of Salvatore's, maybe 8 tables or so, and the bar area is small. So, I was really thankful to visit on a weekday, when I didn't need to wait for seats, and food didn't take too long to arrive. If you're lost, it's right next to Johnson Public House, and have pizza board with skulls saying Wisco on them (So hipster :p)!\n\nThe menu has great selections - lots of appetizers, make your own pizza, specialty pizza and tacos!!! Pretty excited about all these things. Also, there's a good selection of beer and non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nI loved the carbonara pizza - eggs, bacon, cheese. my FAVORITE THINGS. AND, how is it possible that ALL 3 eggs were RUNNY. Such an amazing creamy, rich flavor with runny yolks! The crust of the pizza is thin crust, though not italian thin, but has great chew to it. (P.S. the ~8\""/$14 pizza was so big, we had some leftovers; the leftovers were AMAZING. just heat them up in the oven. oooohhhhh good)\n\nWe also tried the bacon and cheese bread (even though it was similar to our pizza..), the sriracha sauce added some much flavor and depth! LOVE IT. \n\nDefinitely gonna be visiting very soon again! How about some delivery very soon??? Please? :D"
1,"So very, very good. The steaks are excellent, and the Grade 7 Wagyu beef ribeye was worth the $105 pricetag if you truly love meat the way that I do. The sides are also fabulous - butternut squash, kale with pine nuts and white beans, french fries and chanterelle mushrooms were all yum yum yum. Somehow, I took down my 14-ounce steak and all of these sides without a problem, even after enjoying three of the deliciously buttery, salty dinner rolls. The key, I have decided is not to waste your time on starters or dessert. My table skipped the former, but we got suckered into dessert (mostly because we really wanted it)...and that was a bit of a disappointment. The Chocolate Ganache was too bittersweet (even if that is your preference, as it is mine) and dry, and the Cinnamon Monkey Bread was good, but not enough to stand on its own.\n\nService was well-guided, though they have a tendency to want to clear the plates before you're done - annoying. And one server in particular didn't listen all that well...you know when you can just tell somebody is rushing to finish your sentence or answer the question you haven't yet finished asking? \n\nBut all in all, a very good dining experience. Note: I would be pissed if I was not seated in the actual restaurant (which is huge), but rather, the bar area or outside in the mall. Hopefully, they reserve these less desirable seats for those who have not made reservations?"
1,"Best French bisto in the U.S., second to only Le Comptoir in Paris in my opinion! There's really no weak points on the menu. I loved the dinner from start to finish. You really do get the sense that you just might have woken up in Paris here!"
1,"This hole-in-the-wall location is perfectly lovely. Believe the hype, people. My Texan friend complained that their tacos weren't spicy enough, but I'm sure you can let them know to up the spice level for you. I love that they make their own corn tortillas (which are gluten-free, friends). They also fry or grill any meat of your choosing. I met the owner once to interview him for Best of CU for Buzz, and he was the sweetest guy from Mexico City. He recommends the authentic fish tacos. I love their pumpkin flower and corn fungus quesadillas and their chicken volcanes, but all their menu items are perfectly delicious. All orders come with a side of chips with two types of lip-smacking salsa.\n\nRather long wait sometimes, but just go at odd hours or endure the wait. They have an array of authentic Mexican sodas waiting inside as well. Seating is rather fickle and sparse, so get ready to carry out unless you're eating plus one. Enjoy!"
1,"Asian-Mexican Fusion! I recommend the Bulgogi Nachos..they are amazing. As much as everything pretty much. So much food for $! Don't be put off by the sketchy neighborhood, cause you know it will be good"
0,"OMG, we stayed at Harrah's and happened to past by the cafe after clubbing and saw this huge steak and eggs deal for $5.99. When the food came, the steak was so chewy and wasn't cooked right. The hashbrown was cold, the only thing that was decent are the eggs."
1,"We snacked at the bar and had a few drinks for happy hour. It was amazing and a great deal. I recommend the stuffed dates and the steak frites. The bartender was helpful and friendly. I would have never known about this gem if it were not for a random happy hour search, and now I definitely plan on returning and trying their full menu."
0,"I have used irrigation with SPR for over 30 years. They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.\n\nUntil today!\n\nI needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.\n1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.\n2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.\n3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.\n\nZanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.\n\nWhen I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer."
0,Had to try it since we were in Vegas... People told me it was better than Boiling crab... i ain't a fan of craw fish/shrimps but i mean... boiling crab's seasoning is pretty good! So we went in... looks very similar to bc... but when we got the food..... yea... def not like our bc... don't think i would ever go back...
1,"Tasty! Very tasty! Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley. \n\nThe burger is actually a double, you order the toppings individually, and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.\n\nWe ordered two burgers, one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant, it's a good middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger! \n\nThe decore was......um....interesting. Pretty white everywhere. Peanuts as an appetizer?!? And on the wall was non-local reviews. I rather have local reviews but that's all minor. I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got. I'm happy, and will be returning, probably several times. \n\nFYI-If they had alcohol, they would have gotten 5 stars from me. (It'd be nice for \""fast food, sit down joints\"" to take a page out of the Chipotle handbook) umk that's all."
0,Takes forever to even place your order.  They really need to improve the process.  It shouldn't take 10 minutes to place an order!\n\nThe food is good - the presentation is overly generic.  Throw the meat on a generic bun that falls apart after the first bite.\n\nThe pulled pork was yummy and I would go back for it.  The coleslaw was again very generic.
1,"Pleasantly surprised and pleased with Joey's.    We were a little unsure of what to expect due to some negative reviews.   Stopped by for the first time and ordered takeout.   The place was very busy, a good sign.   The dishes on the tables looked delicious.  The staff seems happy and were pleasant, upbeat, talking casually with customers at the bar and also quick to break away and serve me.   The atmosphere is nice but could really use a larger space.   It's crowded.  But still it is neat and clean and everyone looks sharp and is in uniform.\nThe food came quickly.   When we got home, we dug in and boy was it good.   Two types of shrimp and calamari.   All tasted as good as it looked.   The sauces were very good too.   The potatoes were excellent, the coleslaw was good and made like we like it.  The hush puppies were a little dry but tasted good.   The rice and beans were nicely done and very good too.   \nWe are looking forward to going back for a sit down meal.   Thanks Joey's for a great set of food good portions and a fair price.  5 stars on flavor and service. 4 on atmosphere and presentation."
1,"Came here for the first time for \""dinner\"" (finally...) Been wanting to try it since i first heard about it. \n\nSUPER easy to spot at night. If you are coming in from Spring Mountain, its the huge brightly lit Shrimp at the end of the plaza. XD \n\nDecor - very interesting, unique design. they have particular tastes, that may be quite different from others XD \n\nAfter hearing about their hot pot combo AND their skewers... THATS GOTTA BE what we will try ! \n\nLamb Sticks - $5.95 for 8 skewers - We tried the spicy and the medium. Spicy was first. Meat was kind of small. Flavor wise, DELICIOUS ! Spicy and flavorful. Cumin, pepper, and i believe lemon grass as well? Yummy ! Priced good too ! Medium level was actually a bit disappointing. It was quite the huge gap in spice level between medium and spicy. You can call the spicy, on a scale of 1-10, maybe an 8. Medium, 3-4. It wasn't spicy. It was actually sweet to me. Doriee had called it teriyaki lamb. XD \n\nBeef Sticks - $4.95 for 8 skewers - Spicy level as well. Same seasoning as the lamb skewers. Was a little awkward because usually the cumin spice is used for lamb. Was still good. Spicy like the spicy lamb too. Meat amount was more than then lamb. \n\nHot Pot Combo - $11.95 for 20 sticks with up to 4 different items - We had ordered shrimp, fried tofu, king oyster mushroom, and beef tendon balls. \n\nShrimp - Cooked perfectly. Kind of flavorless. Some people had called this place the sichuan hot n juicy. No where near it. None of the sauce stuck. Even peeling the shell and dipping back into sauce didnt help. The Hot Pot \""soup\"" is too thin for that application. \n\nKing Oyster Mushroom - Good texture as this mushroom known to be. Slides OFF the skewer very easily... so you'll have to go caveman spear pokin for it later or just use two skewers and go chopsticks style. \n\nBeef Tendon Balls - Cut into maybe 1/8 slivers ? Holds the soup flavor pretty well. Seemed to have nicely absorbed into the slivers. \n\nFried Tofu - Lol. I had called this \""the item to screw thy self with\""... Fried tofu tends to be VERY porous and is KNOWN to soak up ANYTHING you put it in thats liquid. Spicy hot pot soup and a sponge of a tofu? Yep... XD Holds a LOT of soup in each piece. Tends to dribble down your chin too so be CAREFUL to not get it on yourself and be VERY careful cuz it will \""explode\"" when you bite into it :P \n\nOverall, the lamb skewers were delicious. Beef was ok. Hot pot combo, im pretty sure the soup base is the same one i use for hot pot at home ... Lol flavor was VERY VERY similar... XD Not bad overall. would come back for the lamb skewers alone."
0,"Not very thrilled with this place, but I gave it two stars for the customer service.\nI went in because I received a free underarm or eyebrow wax in the mail. So I decided to try out an eyebrow wax. \n\nThe positive- The staff was very friendly and informative. It was the most comfortable wax I've ever had because they have some sort of special wax that they peel away instead of ripping off.\n\nThe negative- After the wax, I looked at my eyebrows, and they didn't even look like anything had been done to them. The aesthetician told me as she was waxing me that they can't go over again after they've already used the wax, so I didn't bother asking her to re-do my brows.\n\nI can't really complain since it was a free wax, but I don't think I'll be coming back here. All I can say is, meh."
0,"I came here for breakfast after working a LONG shift at the hospital and I have to say I really was not impressed. \nThe drink I ordered the \""Antioxidant\"" seemed watered down and flavorless. \nThe hollandaise on my Eggs Benedict seemed watered down and flavorless. \nOverall the food just seemed uninspired. Maybe it was just my crummy mood after such a long night. I'll have to go back and give them another try. Just in case..."

0,"Can I give it a zero?  I bought a new chew toy for my 11 month old puppy at Petco.  It is a \""chew\"" toy - made for chewers and designed to be chewed called the Multi Texture Chew Ring by Petstages.  Unfortunately, within mere minutes, my puppy chewed apart all 4 of the rubber balls attached to the rope, and pulled the rope to shreds in one part of the rope ring.  I was shocked that he did that so quickly.  Most of his toys last at least a couple weeks, some much longer, and he chews them all.  \n\nI brought the chewed up bits and the rope ring, along with my receipt, back to Petco later that same afternoon.  The clerk would not get a manager because supposedly she was \""on break.\""  The clerk told me that there was nothing that Petco would do as far as exchange it, because nothing was wrong with the toy - it was \""my dog's fault for chewing it so quickly.\""  Another clerk showed up to the register and agreed with the first clerk.  I explained that I understood my dog chewed it up - I did not deny that - but to chew it to pieces within minutes is not my dog's fault - the \""chew\"" toy is obviously not durable.  They refused to do anything at all for me even though I shop there often, I live within a couple miles of the store, and I am a pet lover and would end up buying much more than that $12 chew toy over the years to come.  I explained that PetSmart has told me that if a dog chews apart a toy immediately, to bring it back for a full refund so I thought Petco would have the same policy.  Neither clerk bothered to contact the manager or to exchange it.  \n\nAn 11 month old puppy has many years of food, grooming, toys, clothes, leashes, and accessories to acquire and I will not be purchasing any of them at Petco ever again.  They lost my plentiful business over a $12 chew toy and their poor customer service."
0,"Ugh, after seeing this place on Tanked I had decided to check it out, bleh what a waste of time and money, the food was horrible and the service was worse. Our waiter kept checking on the table next to us and we were forgotten. The person who brought us our food just slammed it down and walked off as if we were bothering him from doing something more important. Then we had asked to speak to the manager and he didn't give a rats ass either. I do not recommend this place at all. We went on Saturday the 25th."
1,"I like the coffee here.  Its been good every time I go.  Sometimes the music is a little loud and I think thats a bit much - but maybe I am just getting old.\n\nI don't know.  I actually like to have a conversation with the person I am there with.  Call me old fashioned, but the music doesn't need to send my drink flying off the table like I am in an 80's Maxell commercial."
0,"So the first time we went to this place, my boyfriend and I went with a couple friends and thought the food wasnt amazing but it was decent and close to home making it more convienent. Not tonight, first we were told to choose our own table (mind you all of the tables were empty, who would have guessed?) then once i chose a table which was a four top, i was rudely told that those werent availible and shoved into a two top which was ackwardly positioned against a brick wall. We asked after a couple minutes of sitting there to be moved to the empty space at the sushi bar, our server was kind and said no problem and moved us there, thats where the problems began. We had a clear view straight into the open kitchen. I forgot to mention that my boyfriend is a chef and knows just a little bit about how things should go down in a kitchen , whether it be sanitary or productive. Lets start with a minor issue. They were using the same cutting board, and knives to cut raw beef, raw squid, and vegetables (dirty unpealed carrots). The food came out fairly quickly, which was nice but did not seem to taste at all how we remembered. The spicy tuna  tasted off , not  quite spoiled, but poor quality fish. There was a roll with huge chunks of red bell peppers that just didnt seem to taste right with the shrimp tempura , maybe a little piece but not an overpowering chunk. Then it took forever for our server to even check back on us because all their employees were to busy eating, texting, and talking all in front of customers plain view without a care in the world (where is the manager? maybe texting in back?)Which didnt seem to unsanitary for servers to be doing but then when the sushi chefs are texting with there gloves on while making food it becomes a sanitation problem . Who knows where there phones have been ? It also to almost 20  minutes to be noticed after done eating to get a check? which is definetly a problem in a slow resteraunt where we see them chatting in back . We both have worked in the food and beverage/customer service  industry for many years, and always seem to be good tippers but in this instance we just could not give a 15% tip for such a terrible experience. None the less, we will not be coming back to Moira ever again. Im only giving this place 2 stars so i dont look like that ass that only gives them one star cause the food didnt taste horrible , especially not the first time we ate here."
1,"Words can't describe what happened to my taste buds here.  Everything was delicious, even things I don't normally like.  I only wish I had the luxury of spending this much money more often.  If you're in Vegas, you have to try L'Atelier!"
1,"Get the Vietnamese coffee - it is decadent. So delicious!\n\nThe Pho is wonderful. Their broth is absolutely delicious. I could just eat that. The beef is always tender and they give you just the right amount..not too much, not too little.\n\nThe service is good, they bring out your food quickly! Everyone seems very friendly. \n\nAfter eating here once, we were hooked. We have been enjoying Pho at least once a week since!"
1,"I am fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this excellent restaurant. The food has always been excellent and the service is very good. The tempura tuna appetizer is delicious, and I've never failed to enjoy any of the entrees.\n\nThis is one of those rare restaurants where the food's flavors are well-layered and interesting without being clever or pretentious."

0,"Don't know why this place has so much hype. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings, big whac(aka Big Mac except that it's vegan ) and Singapore orange noodle bowl.  Unfortunately the food was not so tasty and the bowl was toooo salty. The big whac was not delicious and the wings were decent. The place is cool and it looked as though the desserts were tasty."

1,I was referred to Joe by a friend and he is\nVery good.  He totally informed us BEFORE\nThe market dropped.  He is a $$$$$ saver.
1,"I've never felt so pampered for so little money! \n\nAs soon as my student came over, she offered me tea/coffee/water before she got started. Once I sat down, she asked me what I wanted done and then ran everything by her instructor. First she began with a shoulder/neck massage with eucalyptus oil which was very relaxing. Then she washed my hair and put in a dry remedy moisturizing masque conditioner. While she let the conditioner sit, she gave me a mini facial and and a hand massage. As for the haircut, she did a great job and did exactly what I wanted. The instructor came over at the end to check her work, and she was very thorough. \n\nI've been going to Aveda Institutes for many years now both in Milwaukee and Chicago, but the students here definitely seem to go above and beyond what I've experienced at other locations. The prices here are pretty similar, with a haircut costing $17. But, if you check in on yelp you get 20% off! And there's no tipping allowed, so it's a pretty cheap haircut. I'm a big fan of Aveda products, so it's always a plus when I can get get the Aveda spa pampering without the high price! This is a perfect place for a student like me on a budget!"
0,Food was allright but not sure of it was worth the price. The service was pore. Don't see any reason to ever return.
0,"I'd say this place is a notch above the ghetto fabulousness of Circus Circus, but at least they have some incredibly fun, albeit cheesy, games to keep you entertained. All this place has got are some plain Jane girls in orange leggings and a Dan Marino Grill. The much-promoted $3 blackjack table is literally ONE table on the floor. Unsurprisingly, it's also the most crowded spot in the joint, so good luck pulling up a seat. I sat at the video poker machines and dropped $70 in about 20 min and the goddamn waitress didn't come by once to keep my blood alcohol level high enough to not start getting pissy about my losses. That fact alone will keep me out of here for a long time. \n\nOne marginal positive note is that they have $0.25 wings from 12am-6am, although if you've ever eaten wings from Hooters you know that means you'll probably spend only a couple bucks to get high cholesterol, the caloric equivalent of 5 Whoppers and a long bout of diarrhea. If you call that a deal, well... have at it."
0,"I know you can't fault a casino for taking all of your money. That's like punching a bottle of Beefeater because it made you drink it. However. Treasure Island not only took all of my blackjack money in the quickest series of hands I've ever seen but the dealers have zero personality. Zero. Zilch. Keine.\n\nI will happily hand you $60 if you entertain my pants off while dealing me twelve 14's in a row and I fold on every ... single ... one. I will dance and clap my hands like a stupid monkey while doing it. But since every single dealer at TI sat there like a corpse and didn't even talk or smile while sweeping away my hard-earned chips which I definitely didn't take out of my college tuition fund, then I simply won't enjoy it. Not a laugh or a joke or even a smile. Is Treasure Island owned by Disney? The card dealers are all animatronic. No. No. They're Dementors. They suck the very soul out of you, and there ain't even a cocktail waitress around to help ease the pain.\n\nTI, I rather don't like you at all."
1,"I love that the hot food is on hot plates and salad is on chilled plates.  The salad is very good - good dressing, nice bite size pieces of lettuce, crouton, tomatos, etc.  Their sides are solidly done and their service is superb.  I thought them a bit stuffy before, but upon revisiting - I think I am a fan of their consistent and excellent performance that overrides the annoyance of being forced to valet."
1,"Of of all the Chinese places I've gone to so far around here, this one takes the cake! I could not, for the life of me, find a place that makes affordable Chicken Pad Thai but Yan's makes deliciously right and still keeps it affordable. I go here very other Sunday it's sort of a tradition now. I just love it so much! Yan's gets the highest of fives from me :)"
1,"Madhouse coffee is the local coffee shop I've been looking for all my life! My fave is the blended caramel mocha, way better than any other coffee places! Prices are reasonable and employees are great! I love the wannabe sandwich on focaccia. I never liked pesto but this one is the only pesto I would ever eat! The owner, Marco, is a great guy, he cares about his customers and he takes care of any concerns one might have. Andrea is my fave barista- thanks to her natural sincerity and jolliness! Every morning before work, this is where I'd be found. And on my days off, my system still asks for some madhouse! I'm so madly in love with this place. No one will understand my obsession..."
0,"We put in a FULL PRICED BID on one of their properties...our dream home.  It was a short sale.  Their agent did not respond to the offer!!  For five days our agent texted, emailed and called.  Finally, she was texted and told if she did not respond by 5 pm that evening, our offer was null and void, as was our earnest money.  She texted back THANK YOU.  After the fact, she actually sent a counteroffer, where she asked for $4,600 ON TOP OF HER COMMISSION  on a 460k home to work the short sale!!!  I was so heartbroken, to have lost this home, so I contacted the owner of Windermere by email.  She wrote back that she would be very happy to explain their lawyer backed policy.  This practice is illegal in CA, of charging extra to work the short sale.  But that is not what upset me.  It was the fact that their agent never got back to us about our bid.  Then I saw that our dream home had been sold to someone else.   I'll bet she had a buyer, and she wanted to be both the listing agent and the buying agent to get both commissions.   Who knows,  but I would avoid this company like the plague.  I feel they are deceptive, and I was so dissappointed in the Windermer's owner's response to this."
1,"Yelpers, why so mean to the iconic M&M's. I particularly relate to the Yellow one, he's a little chubby, a little dumb, and if one of the M&M's were an alcoholic, I'm pretty sure it would be him. The store itself is a tourist trap and that seems to be the problem people have with it. Isn't Vegas a tourist trap? Isn't Vegas full of high prices? Nevertheless, M&M's World consists of 4 levels of M&M's utopia with tons and tons of merchandise to be pushed, from toys to clothing and of course candy. I particularly like the history of the candy as you go from level to level on the escalator. I believe there's even a theater that screens a M&M's documentary, but I'm always pressed for time. I bumped it down one star for the touristy prices. A must go for children..and adults."

1,"Glad I stumbled onto this place.  I went there last Saturday (3/28) because we were going to a comedy show at the adjacent Sugarcane Lounge.  Seating was full so we sat at the bar.  Very different but intriguing menu. As we were trying to figure out what to order, this guy next to us told us to order this, this, and that - all of which was incredible.  Turns out the guy was the owner Matt who couldn't have been more gracious and hospitable. \n\nEverything we ordered was superb and bursting with flavor.  The only warning I would give is that the flavors are quite intense and they stayed with me most of the night.  I'm sure the people next to me at the blackjack table were none too pleased.  \n\nAfter throwing my money away the evening before at Koi, this was a welcome find. Yes it's not cheap as previous reviewers stated, but being from L.A. I'm used to spending $$$ for quality sushi.  I am planning another Vegas trip in May and Sushi Samba will definitely be on the agenda.  Highly recommended."
0,"Was looking for a vegetarian place and ended up here. They were a bit disorganized. They were still serving breakfast but I was not in the mood. Unfortunately the lunch options were few - salads and a few sandwiches. I had a hard time finding anything to order. I got the chopped salad, which was huge, and my husband got the spinach salad which was not as big. The salads were good but nothing I  could not fix on my own, although the dressings seem housemade and the caesar dressing was nice and peppery.  But, the service was really slow. I mean these were salads - how long could it really take? All in all I was not thrilled but would like to try for brunch or maybe dinner, on the feeling that lunch is not their strong suit. As a last note, the Asian vegetable soup was very flavorful and the standout."

0,"Ugh... I hate this place. Seriously hate it. I went in for a friends birthday, her choice clearly...as soon as I saw the menu I was filled with disappointment. Nothing on here isn't fried, like nothing. I'm surprised even the menu wasn't presented to you fried. Honestly the food is SO cheap & nasty I could go to lidl & pick up something better. Its REDICULOUS prices too, for what you get.... there are so many lovely restaurants (even the snobby upper class ones) that charge less than this... \u00a313 for a crappy burger... seriously?! My food came out swimming in oil it was jut so greasy I wanted to go home & have a shower afterwards. \nThe only saving grace as the staff, which I cannot fault at all, service was spot on, friendly & attentive... i'm sorry to give you guys a low score as you were all working so hard & I know its a chain so staff have no control over the menu, but the food is just horrible & I would not recommend this if it was the last place to eat on earth."
1,"I LOVE this place. LOVE LOVE LOVE!\n\nLet's start this review by saying that Vegas just isn't my scene. I don't gamble. I don't club. I don't like places that seem soulless. Thank God for the Double Down.\n\nThis place is everything that the Strip isn't. It's dark, cheap, and plays great music. There were some live bands while I was there. Some rockabilly, some punk. Both good. The bartenders were chill, but quick to fill your glass. There was some weird, porn type, cartoons on. The jukebox was pretty stellar. There's a photobooth that I was too drunk to partake in. Dammit. The bacon martini is gross. There, I said it. I do believe that bacon vodka would make the best damned bloody mary, though. But as a martini, with bacon fat floating on the top - no bueno. \n\nWe came here twice during our three night stay. Both times the staff and patrons were friendly. I also met some people, from Chicago, with whom I have mutual friends. Just goes to show that the cool kids know where to go. If you're from Chicago and you're looking for a taste of home (enter Liars, Delilahs, etc) - this is your joint.\n\nDid I mention it's a 24 hour joint? AWE YEAH!"
1,Great food. The surf and turf was awesome the steak was mouth watering. The staff was very friendly and courtesy.
1,"Love the teriyaki, how it's not too fatty, and the sauce is amazing! The crunch roll is good too, but the miso soup I got was too hot to enjoy and ended not feeling like it after it cooled down. \n\nPrices are a bit steep, but the quality is there. Will definitely be back when I'm craving quick Japanese!"
1,"Love this place. Right next to motel 6. Food, price and services were good. Will come again for next trip."
0,"I've been to Lux twice since they've made the move next door, and I figured it was ok to give a review. I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas. \n\nLux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a \""look\"" of, \""hey, who are you?!\"" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.\n\nThe new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the \""hipster\"" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.\n\nI will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the \""Number 47\"" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, \""Well today it's just the 46.\"" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.\n\nOh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing? \n\nOverall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the \""hipster mecca\"" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth."
0,"DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!  Broken and unsafe equipment and terrible customer service!  The machines they rent are broken and they are held together with \""bubble gum and baling wire\"".  They tried to fix the dunk tank with a trailer hitch?!?  Really?  Run, don't walk from this company..."
1,"From the outside, this place looks pretty ghetto. You get to get off the freeway and pass all the people in shopping cart villages living in the center divider islands. The building is one story with different additions and paint colors. The parking lot is apartment style covered parking.  \n\nHOWEVER!!!  This museum is in partnership with the Smithsonian. The artifacts and exhibits are WONDERFUL. The staff is SO friendly and eager to educate.  \n\nThere is so MUCH more to see here than what you anticipate. The gift shop is better than what I saw at the NH Museums in San Diego and LA. \n\nI had to bring my kids on this trip to Vegas and I had always wanted to check this place out. They were my excuse. The admission was TOTALLY inexpensive AND they have a coupon on their website. \n\nI would DEFINITELY go back here.  With *or* without my kids.   :0) \n\nI keep telling my friends and neighbors about it. Even though I had a negative experience or deceptive appearance on approach, once I walked in here and experienced what they had to offer, I was and AM totally SOLD."
1,"We ate at La Bona Pasta last Thursday for dinner and we can't wait to go back.  The food was very good... FRESH, the atmosphere was inviting and the service was excellent.   They have an extensive menu, so there is something for everyone.  We each had something different for dinner and we were all very pleased.  The prices were very reasonable and a salad was included with our meals.\n\nWe prefer to support family owned businesses.... We are tired of the chains with their mediocre food and service.  La Bona Pasta, you are a classy, casual operation!"
0,"Do I eat the pizza with a spoon or straw? After seeing many amazing reviews, The Fam and I thought we would give this place a go. Boy, what a let down! I was uber excited to have a \""true pizza\"" place in the NW part of Vegas. After finally trying it, I will continue to drive completely across town to a true pizza place. \n\nThe Cons:\n*if you are a first timer to the restaurant be prepared to be confused on the ordering process and to not receive much help trying to get clarification. \n*The two pizza's The Fam and I experienced were soggy beyond belief. It was almost pizza soup. \n*While we were trying to drink our dinner, we happened to spill a glass of water on the table. When I attempted to find someone to assist or even just a towel it became an impossible task. \n* The fresh mozzarella didn't have much flavor, but this could also be because we don't get very much on either pizza.\n*When we asked for more cheese they busted out the Sysco shredded cheese.\n*last but not least ... they have Pepsi products. I don't hold this one against them too much, but I am a Coca-Cola girl. \n\nThe Pros:\n*The food is ready in a matter of minutes.\n*The actual flavor of the cooked parts of the crust and most toppings was good.\n*The atmosphere is nice.\n*The cashier was friendly."
0,This is from 9/10/2012 My lazy self is just now...filling this out...\nThe owner and his staff are very unpolite and selfish humans. People everything is extra if u want a napkin...thats extra...you want water you know what...thats extra. Dont inhale cuz thats extra. Now should you pull up to the drive thru you will be told welcome to pop eyes please hold...each and every time. They always out of something and treat u like u how dare u expect hot chicken from us! So what we out of chicken...dont come in here and demand chicken from us...make n demands yeah thats 25 cents extra. So what you can take your business some where else guess what take n ya business some where else...is extra. Yes they provide cold half ass fried chicken the corn is always over cooked with a burnt smell and taste. They never butter the corn. And they always out of something. But they stank attitude is a must because they never out that that mess....EVER. Matter O fact they give that free...Oh who am I kidding you know thats extra!
1,"This was my first time eating at Pho Thanh as well as my 1st time eating Vietnamese food. The restaurant is small and most of the tables were full so that's a good sign. \nI was pleasantly surprised with our food & dining experience. I was not sure what to order so my boyfriend helped me pick something since he has eaten Vietnamese before. I ordered the lemongrass chicken; it was a little spicy but not over powering. He ordered some Pho, a pork sandwich and some spring rolls, all of which were good as well. We are both excited to go back and try some different items."
1,Best sandwiches eveeeeeer!\n\nWhere else can you get a super bomb yummy sandwich at 4 in the morning? At EARLS!!!!   They also have great cobb salad and chicken noodle soups.
1,"We visited this resort as a last ditch effort to procrastinate our trip home to LA and we couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised!  To say that the staff is friendly and guest-serviced oriented is an understatement.  From the valet staff, to the dealers, to the restaurant staff - each person we encountered throughout our brief visit seemed genuinely focused on our comfort and satisfaction.  The casino has a lively energy to it.  The dealers are wonderfully interactive with players.  The food at the Studio B Buffet was tasty and plentiful.  We ABSOLUTELY love this place.  As Vegas veterans, we should certainly stay at this resort if we need a break from the hustle and bustle of The Strip and Downtown."
1,"This was our second stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. After the 'not very good' service we received at 1130 (two doors down), we decided to sit at the bar. There were quite a few people enjoying their wine and little pizza sliver snacks and the wait staff was very attentive (and absolutely adorable!) They ran out of the snacks so I had to wait a while for them to cook up another batch, but had a pleasant time watching the game and chatting with my friends. The atmosphere is cozy, I like the way they updated the old UNO shop and the full bar. I will definitely go back to try something off the menu."
1,"Let me start out this entire review by saying that I am not really what one would describe as a \""vegas\"" person. My idea of a fun night nowadays typically revolves around dinner parties, a single glass of malbec, a movie, all in time to make it into bed right as the clock strikes 11PM. But alas, as they say (or do they?)...When in Vegas...\n\nI'm pretty sure that when Katy Perry wrote \""Waking up In Vegas\"" she was really referring to the Mandalay Bay Resort, all its lavish las vegas luxuries and particularly  Daylight Beach Club and Light Nightclub. My stay at the resort was nothing short of rage-tastic, 3 hours sleep total over the course of 3 days and nights/days at Daylight Beach Club and Light Nightclub turned our weekend vacation into your quintessential movie-like \""classy mess.\""\n\nDaylight Beach Club is a, surprise!, beach club that ho-downs hard during the day, and has solid grasp on not only what the haut couture crowd of day drinking and day partying is all about; but goes above and beyond to provide the quintessential \""waking up in Vegas\"" ambiance. We were at Daylight for the Krewella Get Wet tour sequence; Krew has a residence there and performs EVERY month. Acoustics of the stage are great...service is consistent and attentive.\n\nThe clientele are typically post grads in the 25-30 age group-- but you'll feel somewhat like you've transported back a few years as the laid back atmosphere catalyzes such an aura and vibes.\n\nAll and all...FAB spot. Check out their shows. Get there early to establish real estate or a locker. Enjoy!"
1,"Love the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. This location is much smaller than the one at Aria, but has a constant line for a reason: the pastries, desserts, crepes, coffees, and chocolates are divine.\n\nHordes of people crowd around to take pictures of the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (according to the strange folks at Guiness), but I was more mesmerized by the fresh crepes, croissants, and cupcakes. We enjoyed a late breakfast 2 days in a row featuring pastries from Jean Philippe and wish we had stayed at the Bellagio longer just to have more.\n\n * Palmier - Flaky, crisp cookie covered with caramelized sugar 5/5\n * Croissant - Light and airy with a butter flavor to melt in your mouth 4/5\n * Almond Croissant - Filling Cr\u00e8me D'amandes; sprinkled with sugar & almonds 5/5\n * Chocolate Croissant - Jean Philippe chocolate + croissant = yum 3.5/5\n * Blueberry Brioche - Surprisingly addictive slice of bread with blueberries 3/5\n * Blueberry Danish - Light shell and heavy fruit jam heaven 4/5\n * Latte - Pick me up of espresso & steamed milk to start the day 4/5\n * White Cafe Mocha - Sweet mocha (espresso & chocolate) with White Chocolate 5/5\n\nThere are two locations and both on Yelp list Aria as the address when in fact the one with the chocolate fountain is in the Bellagio.\n\nJean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio was perfect."
1,This place was cool. The replica of the stair case and the bow of the ship was awesome. The artifacts were amazing. Very interesting to learn about history.\n\nI though the best part is the boarding pass with a passengers name that they give you when you start the tour and you find out at the end if your passenger dies.\n\nFor $35 I have no complaints. Would've have gave it a 5 star if it was a little longer. I got through the exhibit in a half hour.
1,"This place is magical. I would highly recommend it. Especially the fresh spring rolls, the mango curry, the Thom Som.  However, what steals the show is the sticky mango rice.  I would dare you to have the entr\u00e9es with Lao spice. It's pretty wild."
1,The chipotle raspberry turkey on cranberry walnut is great!!\n\nThe service is friendly and atmosphere is fun. It's a great place to grab a bite to eat.
1,A very professional place remodel great therapist different modalties experience therapist call for your appt
0,Could be sooooo much better. Everything just seems LAZY. From the food to the service :(
0,"Facts; They will cut corners in every way. Materials, labor, and skipping critical steps during the process. Like not painting or at least priming walls prior to new finish materials. Covering up mold on existing walls. I took pictures of their tile guy using blue masking tape to cover large gaps in drywall pryer to tiling  them.  Abusive to employees, suppliers, and customers."
1,"Words cannot explain how great the staff at cj dentistry are. Dr joh and his staff put you at ease and takes the time to understand your anxiety and apprehension. they know every trick in the book to make the appointment extremely enjoyable. and what i loved most is he speaks to you in terms you understand, not overly \""clinical\"". Dr  Joh has such a warm personality and vast knowledge it is impossible not to enjoy your time with him. Even with his busy schedule he makes sure to be very thorough with your exam and takes the time to get to know you. He and his staff take the time to find a way to accommodate you as soon as possible. The assistants are knowledgeable and keep the appointment going smooth and help get you in and out on time. The entire staff takes their time to explain procedures, insurance coverage, billing statements and work their hardest to help you get the most out of your appointment. They are happy to show you many different options to meet your financial means. This dental office clearly has one concern and that is the health of your mouth! without question, I would recommend to all friends and family! this new, beautiful office is just the addition this plaza needed. very convenient. scheduling is never a problem and they truly work around your needs. Dr. Joh and his staff have made me a patient for life! thank you so much CJ Dentistry!!!!"
0,"I've been to Kaya in the past and it was great.  However, it appears to be experiencing a rough go of it lately.  I went for lunch and ordered the Jerk Chicken.  The menu describes it as a \""tropical chop salad, romaine, flour tortillas, mango, pineapple, cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro, avocado.\""  What I received was chicken atop a pile of pineapple with some slices of avocado on the side.  The redemption of the meal was the wonderful chowder and some good wine."
0,"This place is a ABSOLUTELY horrible. I still don't understand why it has so many stars. \n\nFirst of all I would like to preface this with the fact that I love a great dive bar I really do. But what makes a great dive bar? To me this fills none of the voids.\n\nGenerally when there's no big game going on or busy there is absolutely NO ATMOSPHERE(not even in a divey way). LOL It's dark, the locals there are less than appealing and every TV or entertainment device is old or going out... Maybe this is what some like in a Dive Bar?\n\nHere's the worst part to me. I am a DIE HARD OREGON DUCKS FAN. Well this is supposed to be a OREGON DUCKS BAR. It is.... but it's about the most musty, claustrophobic, crowded Ducls bar you been in. Word to the wise on this... Do yourself a favor if you're a DUCK FAN.. Run up the road 5 mins and go to Dos Gringos. It's a open air DUCKS BAR that gives away free Ducks gear and run by the Alumni. Big new tv's inside and out. You won't be disappointed!!\n\nBut please in all facets do yourself a favor don't be deceived by the high stars and avoid the Well Bar."
0,"After hearing how beautiful this bar is, my husband and I stopped by for a pre-dinner cocktail on the second level of the bar.  It really is gorgeous (in a very feminine and sparkly kind of way) and our server was surprisingly attentive given how packed it was, but the drinks were really disappointing, especially given the $13 price point.  I had the red dragon martini, and I can only characterize it as sickeningly sweet and devoid of alcohol - sort of like a Welsh's frozen juice pop, but with a strange peppery substance coating the rim of the glass."
0,"Like many others have said, this place is new and has some kinks to work out. I'll definitely try it out again in another couple months.\n\nWith that being said, my guy and I were really disappointed that for having a unique name and a \""claim to fame\"" (at least potentially) they really don't own their \""Oink Cafe\"" handle. Yeah they've got 5 different types of bacon but the menu is sadly lacking in entrees featuring what they're all about. In reality, this cafe is just like any other but with the option of five different types of bacon for those few items featuring bacon in the menu. And that's if the bacon hasn't run out. \n\nHopefully they find a way to make their mark."
0,Very rude Service. Walked in at 4:40pm. The place was totally empty. The only other customer in the place was leaving. I was then led to a small table in the back. I asked if I could move to a larger table in the front next to the wall. I was told NO! I have to sit in the back where I could smell the bathrooms. Unbelievable over 50 empty tables and I was told I have to sit there.\n\nI then immediately walked out! Don't have to spend my $$ at a place that is so unfriendly towards it's customers.
0,"The food was bad and over priced.  The waitress was slow and not helpful.  She couldn't even think of anything to suggest we get when asked.  Also, she served me a beer that was only 3/4 full and charged me $5 bucks for those 6ozs of bud light.  \nThe bartender single handily ruined the night for the group with rude comments and D bag behavior.  At one point he called out some people in our group over the PA system to stop cheering about the beer pong tournament because they were annoying. This caused a few of them to be insulted.  They were not out of control or anything... just gave a woot to our friends who were playing.  \nBut hey no worries, Mr. Bartender,  I'll never suggest to any of my out of town guests, who are looking for some fun, to spend any of their money at Blondies."
1,"Planet Hollywood just looks like a fun place to be.  It's always crowded when I walk in there.  My next Vegas trip is booked there so I can get a better feel of what this place is all about.  As of now, I like the atmosphere."
1,My husband and I had a problem with our bed and it was resolved that day.  Customer service was extremely nice and helpful.  I would recommend Ashley furniture.
0,What happened to this place? Wow very disappointed- we used to enjoy it here. The bagals just did not seem right. No one seemed very happy. I really didn't recognize anyone. I heard over heard someone say they sold the place. I hope they get their act together.
1,"This is the only work of his that I have seen in person. After living in the valley since 2002, I FINALLY decided to head out that way.  I found the information about the life and times of Frank Lloyd and his 3rd wife very interesting. The house was amazing and beautiful. I especially loved the local rocks cast into the concrete, and the lines that created a flow.   I would highly recommend this tour to any one with an interest in form, function, and beauty."
0,"I'm freakin' DONE with this place. \nEvery time I come here I get above-average food (good!) with poor service (bad!) \nLast time I was here our server never came back to pick up our check and it took so long that i had to get up and go looking for someone else to get us some change. \nThis time I ordered the soup-and-half-sandwich plate. I was offered chicken noodle or French onion. I went with the onion. When the check came, I was charged extra for the soup. When my server came back to pick up my card (and she took a LONG time to come back around and wasn't even the same server as the time before... is this protocol at this restaurant?) she said \""oh, yeah, that soup costs extra.\"" Interesting, as the surcharge isn't noted on the menu and as a former server myself, I know I should have been told about this when given the choices. \nI won't lie: the food is pretty hearty. But is it worth the flippant service?"
1,"Fun casino with a lot of entertainment.\n\nThey had a female performer who did both dance routines and sang popular 90s songs while standing on a small stage surrounded by slots.\n\nLots of lively craps and poker tables.\n\nAlways a server around to brings complimentary pi\u00f1a coladas.\n\nA dimly lit burger joint with TVs.\n\nAll easily accessible after watching the Penn & Teller performance.\n\nI really liked their slots. Both my fella' and I got some good bonus rounds and I adored the Wicked Witch of the West slot machine. \n\nI'll see ya next time, Rio!"
1,"I love spicy foods but they are not kidding when they write CAUTION all over the menu next to the habanero burger. It is absolutely ridiculous. My boyfriend has a really high tolerance for spice and he could even eat the whole thing... but a day later he called me and said he wouldn't be ordering it again because digesting it was painful.... hahaha. I could only eat half of the habanero burger the first time I went so the second time, I just got a regular burger with bleu cheese. Was delicious though... can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu.\n\nHappy hour prices are great!"
1,"This is a great place for home furnishings.  They sell pictures, plants, outdoor decor...  I have found some great deals here, and it is nice to go and look around.  There is a lot of fragile items though, so I need to keep an eye on my children at all times.  Most of the time a stroller keeps them contained though.\n\nI have found the clerks really helpful and friendly."
1,"Phoenix and its large abundance of ice cream shops, Churn rates high in the cutesy scale. Small in size, it appeals to me since they have good ice cream as well delectable sweets. I love their assortment of cookies and bars. I like that you can make your own ice cream sandwich, and that it's encouraged. I've been here numerous times but I would like to highlight the professionalism of their staff when accommodating my niece who has a peanut allergy. They made sure to rinse the ice cream scooper as well take out a new tub of the double chocolate ice cream, in order to ensure that there wouldn't be any contamination whatsoever. I commend the staff for doing that extra step. bravo. Anywho, if you plan to eat at the ice cream shop, there are tables in the back patio, and since there's lack of parking, complimentary valet is offered (no need to risk your life crossing busy central ave. by parking across the street)."
0,"Sadly, we're over this location. Clearly, the management of this location is pitiful. The food is pretty standard Rio food, but the mishaps have become too frustrating. We go there about weekly for takeout and every, yes every, time they mess something up. Last night, it was the salad dressings. They messed up on which dressing was included with the salad and didn't include the pint house dressing that we bought. The time before, it was the soda we bought that they forgot. The time before that, it was a 30 minute wait in line. Oh, and spoke to the manager the most recent time who was less than concerned. And so on, and so on. I'm over it. It's easily my favorite fast food place in vegas, but the frustration and 35 minute round trips to get whatever they forgot is too much. Farewell Sahara Rio. No more delicious gut-bombs for us!"
1,"I used to eat at this location quite often at my old job. \n\nWe received a few hours notice that corporate was going to be by work, and said they were covering lunch for the 35 of us. What options did we have? Given that we were making calls at 7:30am, we ran into bar or fast food as our options. Then the light bulb illuminated my mind and realized we could try Jimmy John's. If they make freaky good food, freaky fast... could they make 35 lunches in a freaky fast time?\n\nWhy yes, yes they could! We placed our order on line, which went very smoothly, and indicated our desired pick up time a couple hours ahead of time. \n\nI went to pick up the food and as I walked in the door, they were literally wrapping up the last box lunch and packing the 4th box of sandwiches up. After paying the staff was very gracious to help carry everything out to the car with me.\n\nThe food was a hit with everybody at work, so delicious, as always! Can't wait until we have last minute lunch needs again!"
1,"I came here on my way to the Jardin Botaniques after reading Gen. M's review.\nMy girlfriend and I had tried (and loved) Schwartz's and I decided to see if it really was better. We ordered their medium smoked meat sandwiches (she ordered the normal and I got the jumbo fatty size) with water. The plates were packed with goodies. My plate had two giant stack of meat with two sad little pieces of bread, trying to hold it all in, some home-style fries and coleslaw with half a pickle and a picked pepper wedge. The other plate was exactly the same, only with a bit less meat.\nIt's hard to say if it was better than (or as good as) Schwartz's because we were famished, but I think it was quite respectable. If I go back to the Jardin Botanique and crave some smoked meat, this place would do the trick just fine.\nDon't come here expecting the same ambiance as the other place, you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for more room, more time (you're not rushed out the door once you finish) and a bit more ambiance, this place might be for you.\nI think the bill came to 30$ for both of our meals all in."
0,went in for the two slice special..a fresh pie was just coming out of the oven so I thought I was in luck..i had sausage added and it smelled kinda funny on the way home ..after a few bites it tasted a little sour YUK..\nI have given them several tries since the old owner is back..done! never again!!
1,"I love Sambalatte.  This is just what Vegas needed.  It is a beautiful, relaxing place with great tea and a wonderful staff.  Great place to hang out working on your computer, for a business meeting or for an outing with friends and family."
1,"We wanted a snack before we get buffet later on that night so we stumbled upon here\n\n[+] we got samples of the chicken tenders and boy, was that a good choice on their part b/c we ended up getting 20 pieces!\n[+] the chicken tenders are amazing and were actually tender!\n[+] ordered 20 pieces and we got around 24 pieces\n\nThe chicken was pretty delicious and if we're ever around the area, we'll probably get it again."
0,"U should call this place Robertos. and that would be an insult to mr. roberto himself. i had the fish tacos of course and wow were they plain. just think of middle school lunch fish in a bland torilla. flavorless. u would think with a name \""wahoo's fish tacos\"" their tacos would be good. this is really a bar. the bar is good and it has gaming so go here to drink and gamble not eat."
1,GO HERE!\n\nThere is NO reason why you shouldn't check this place out. Open 24 hours.. cheap.. delicious... just go! Expect to wait if you go at 4am like I did the other night.. No biggie.. you will make friends with others in line. PH was playing some bangin music when we were in there so we were jammin in line..
0,"If I could give less than one star I would. They are ruining Amazon Prime's reputation. I payed for Prime because the 2-day shipping has been fast and reliable. But if ONTRAC is in charge of the shipment, don't hold your breath. They don't knock on your door, they just keep leaving attempted delivery notes even if you're home. If you call them they suggest you go pick it up at their facility, which for me is a 25 minute drive to the ghetto. NOT safe. I loathe this company with every fiber of my being."
0,"Since there was a long wait at Ramen Sora, my husband suggested we eat here instead.\n\nThe service was good. The staff was friendly. Our water was always filled.\n\nUnfortunately I can't say the same about my food. I ordered the pho with steak and tripe. This is the only thing I get at Vietnamese restaurants. When it was brought out, it looked like it was going to be amazing. The bowl was huge. However one sip of the soup and I was greatly disappointed. It was unbelievably bland. A good broth is what makes a bowl of pho great since the noodle itself is typically flavorless.\n\nMaybe I've been spoiled by all the delicious pho in San Gabriel Valley, but this was very underwhelming. \n\nLesson learned. Next time just suck it up and wait. There's a reason why there is a line."
1,"Went to the opening of this a couple weeks ago.\n\n1st, let me just say that its awesome to have another live music venue in Tempe. \n\n2nd, it's great to have another theater in town (w/ the recent departure of TLT).\n\nAlthough they weren't serving food or drinks yet, the cafe space looked phenomenal. The graffiti work on the walls is gorgeous, and there are plenty of tables and couchs for people to sit at. It's nice to have a space to \""get away\"" from the bands that are playing to have a conversation, but still be able to enjoy the music.\n\nI love the side gallery too, what a great idea. \n\nThe stage looked great too. Good for bands and just the right depth for an actual theatrical production. \n\nThe counter bar in the middle of the room is very cool. With pub tables as well, it gives the feel of being back at Last Exit while a band is playing and like youre in a kitchy club for all other avant garde performances.\n\nHope to see more local bands there as well as theater!"
1,"I originally looked at Tryst Cafe as a brunch possibility a few weeks ago, but didn't end up getting to there. There brunch menu and the photos on yelp made it look amazing. I am hoping to try out their brunch soon. I did get to try out their dinner last night with a friend. My friend and I started off with the battered green beans appetizer that comes with like 6 different dipping sauces. I was a big fan of the cilantro aioli. For dinner, we both got the Ahi Tuna melt with brie cheese on a parmesan crusted brioche bread. It was absolutely delicious and we would both recommend others order it. The sweet potato tots that we had as a side instead of the salad that normally comes with it were a great compliment to the sandwich. Of course, we had to finish off our meal with their cr\u00e8me brule that had fresh strawberries and blackberries on top. It was a great end to a great meal. The cr\u00e8me brule was delectable to say the least. Overall, we had a great experience and an amazing meal. Even though we didn't try any of their cocktails, I did look at the cocktail menu and am excited to try one of them my next visit. I have my eye on the pear margarita. :)"
0,"Normally have a great experience. Last time I came in, my entire experience only lasted 25 minutes!!!! How could anyone expect to have all of the following treatments completed in 25 minutes:\n* Haircut \n* Paraffin Hand Dip \n* Shampoo \n* Conditioning Treatment \n* Mini Facial \n* Hot Towel \n* Scalp Massage \n* Re-shampoo \n* Styling \n\nAnd while I was getting my cut, the girls were complaining it was so busy because the front desk was booking people every 30 minutes. After dropping $60 and walking out with an uneven cut, I dont think I will be returning back here again. I think the Haircut portion of my appointment only 10 minutes! How can anyone expect to get a decent haircut in 10 minutes. they spent more time doing the foo foo pampering stuff"
1,"Girl Talk was performing at the outdoor Boulevard Pool area the night I came to The Cosmo. It was a freaking awesome concert, even though it was windy and cold as hell outside. One thing I really like about this hotel is that they have a giant LED screen outside the hotel that shows you all the main events going on live and Girl Talk was no exception.\n\nThe entire hotel is VERY swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at (ie: the three story Chandelier Bar which is made with $30 million worth of real crystals. No wonder everybody complains about Vegas' economy-maybe you shouldn't spend that much building a bar lol). The location is also very awesome. My only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget (probably to help pay for that bar haha). Good luck trying to find a table for less than $50 on the weekends.\n\nHowever, when I become a millionaire, you better believe I'll be hanging out with the equally swanky 20 something-year-old glamour gods and goddesses the hotel tries to cater to."
1,"This place looks a lot worse than it is. The poorly shot photos of their food on their windows and walls do not do them any favors. I wound up eating here by chance when I was bringing back a group of teens to the JCC a few doors down--we had a few minutes for lunch before bringing the rest of the kids back to tucson. Most of the kids wound up in the mexican place next door, and seeing as we were pressed for time, I decided that Id get some thai food since I love thai. I asked the lady in there if I could get something very quickly to go, she said no problem. I asked if I should get the pad thai or the yellow curry, she said get the yellow curry. So I did. She asked me how hot (and knowing that I had a cold and wanted something kinda spicy, but also momentarily forgetting that I was in a thai restaurant) I told her \""make it pretty hot\"". In retrospect, I might have used a bit more caution with that statement. I also ordered some crab puffs which i know is not authentic, but i was in the mood. The crab puffs turned out to be excellent. Just different enough from your standard chinese food arrangement and yet still delicious with their different style dipping sauce. The yellow curry was AMAZING, albeit a LITTLE bit spicier than I would have liked on a normal day...well, actually, it was a freakin inferno...but it felt good to eat it with my cold and all. Just be advised ;) Would definitely go back next time im in the area. My only complaints were that it took a little bit longer than I would have liked considering my situation, but had I been sitting down it would not have been a problem, and secondly the price was a little high I felt. It was after 3 (so a late lunch, i guess) and wound up having to pay the dinner prices. The two orders, without a drink came to about $15. Not terrible, but a little more than I would have liked to pay."
1,"This is our favorite restaurant for Korean food.  Prices are excellent especially when compared to other options for Korean.  We always get the spicy seafood soup very good and generous seafood portions.  Another favorite is the Stone Pot Bibimbop, perfect amount of flavor and excellent texture in the crunchy rice.  The side dishes are also amazing.  Service is always quick and friendly.  Decor leaves much to be desired, but we go for the food.  I highly recommend this restaurant."
0,"This place is too pricey for dry cleaning - and I am never sure what I am going to end up paying.  Usually, 4 items (a mix between dress shirts, slacks, basic dresses) costs around $20 - $25 and has a three or four day turn around period.  \n\nI've also used their tailoring services to get a pair of pants hemmed and was disappointed in the outcome - they were still too long. \n\nThe main selling point on this place was the location, it really is the only dry cleaners downtown. And the cute dog is fun to pet.  But, I've recently discovered another cleaners uptown who charges less than half and will have it ready for me the same day - that's worth a drive!"
1,"The food here is good, but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Everything was was good quality and well prepared (and fast!) and the price was very reasonable. My wife and I both ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (white) which came with cornbread and two sides. I got the baked beans and the special: spicy mac & cheese. The first thing I tried was the cornbread, and found it had jalape\u00f1os and whole kernels of corn baked in. I know some people really like the whole corn in the cornbread thing, but I'd rather keep my breads and vegetables separate. Next up was the spicy mac & cheese. I love mac & cheese, and I've become a big fan of having a bit of hot sauce added to give it some kick, so I was really excited about this. It certainly had the spicy; it had lots of jalape\u00f1os mixed in and was quite hot. What it was lacking was the cheese. There was no creaminess to it at all. The baked beans, however, were very good. They also had jalape\u00f1os mixed in (are you sensing a theme here?), but only had a subtle kick which was balanced with a slightly sweet tangy sauce. As for the chicken, the flavor was excellent but most of the breast was pretty dry. The wing, on the other hand, was quite juicy. If you're looking for really moist chicken you might have better luck with the dark meat. There were no jalape\u00f1os in the chicken."
1,I have to say this eastern Carolina BBQ is some of the best I have had since when I was a child living in Greenville NC. My granddaddy use to take us to his favorite BBQ place just across the Tar River near the airport almost every Sunday for dinner. Living in Florida I don't get this type of 'Q down there. So when I am in Charlotte I make it a point to eat here. Twice now and counting.
1,"Great park area!  It's always clean and very well kept. We celebrated my son first birthday at one of the pavilions and all the kids had a blast. I was lucky that someone cancelled, apparently the pavilions book months in advance.  \nThe play area is completely covered, which is a necessity once  it starts getting hot."
0,Garbage rooms. Least comfortable hotel beds I've ever experienced. Ended up sleeping on the floor on a couch cushion instead.
1,"A light perfume of cardamom and other sweet spices, a vast selection of international sweets, spices and foods, PLUS, most importantly to me on my visit on the hottest day of Spring 2013, liters of cold water made this a place worth entering.  I left with water, a half pound of cashews, another half pound of Turkish coffee, date filled cookies and a nicely crafted small necklace for Sweet D. Great, friendly service.  A good stop.  The Phoenicia Cafe and a men's room were adjacent.  Next trip I'll try the Phoenicia and report."
1,"What can I say? \n\nWhen I shop for diamonds, I expect a certain level of service. Jared definitely delivered. This is my fifth time buying from this Jared, and it wont be my last. \n\nGreat service. Great products. Clean store with no B.S."
0,"We are repeat customers. Today's visit was disappointing. My wife's burger wasn't fully cooked. The fries didn't seem to be fully cooked either. They were crispy on the outside but hard on the inside. I'm not an expert on cooking fries so I don't know what causes that. \nThe place was clean and friendly. Service was fast, but would have waited a little longer if that's what is needed. We will come back because we have been pleased in the past. Hopefully our experience this visit will be isolated."
1,Good food. A bit pricey but the atmosphere makes up for it. Service good. Very attentive wait staff. We have been there several times
1,"I would have given them 4 1/2 if I could. It would have been 5 if my waiter brought me the strawberry cheesecake I asked for but he brought cherry cheesecake, which was good but not what I ordered. I also had the seafood lasagna which was delicious! Seriously good food. And I loved the Sarsaparilla!"
0,"Its just O-K. \n\nI had a very bad experience with the customer service the first time and left before my food arrived but gave it another shot a few weeks later.\n\nThis time, the service was very good: prompt seating and drinks. The thai ice tea is the best in town! They have the set dinner menu options: I had the vegetarian option #2 which includes a spring roll (yummy), a thai mushroom soup (delicious) and pad thai. The pad thai is decent but have had MUCH MUCH BETTER! \n\noverall, experience was ok but there is better Thai food out there. Be careful because there \""spicy\"" is VERY VERY SPICY!"
0,"Upon booking my room about a month before my stay, I requested early check in. This because we were flying in and I knew it was going to be HOT. Before I even boarded  the plane i called the Tropicana again just to reiterate the need for early check in. I was told they had my initial request on file and it shouldn't be a problem. I was informed to just head over to the hotel. Once I'd gotten to the hotel which I'll admit was about 10:30am and really early, i asked if there was a room available. Not shocked that there wasn't because of the time i checked my bags. Jo Ann told me to check back in a few hours and we should be ok. Will kill time getting good and drinks then arrive back at the hotel at 1:00pm. Jo-Ann informed us again that there still weren't any rooms ready. She says to check back in at 2:30pm. I'm thinking,\"" Really? I requested early check in and regular check in is at 3:00 but you want me to come back at 2:30?\"" I bite my tongue and kill another 1 1/2 hours with my friend and more drinks. At 2:30pm on the dot we are in front of Jo Ann again,\"" She tells me AGAIN there are no rooms available. At this point I'm not very happy but i keep it together. She says and I quote,\"" Early check in is not guaranteed but a request. It looks like its going to be more around 3:30 before I can check you in. You should be lucky that you are even getting a 2 queen room because we are sold out this weekend. We have to accommodate our Diamond Club Members and well as hotel invited guest first.\"" I was in utter shock. That was it! I told her,\"" I should be lucky to get the room I PAID you for a month ago?! Ok...\"" At that point I just walked away. I've learned that the people at the desk have to answer to someone so just contact the person the answer to. I get the hotel manager on the phone who is more than apologetic when I tell her that I was made to feel like my money was not wanted and that I was less important than their precious Diamond Club Members. Literally within minutes she tells me both my and my friends rooms are ready. How funny is that. I go back to the counter to check in and was lucky enough to NOT get Jo Ann. Jo Ann over hears that the rooms are ready and responds \""Thank God!\"". How unprofessional can one person be? I say nothing, get my key, and go. End of Jo Ann\n\n\nFast forward to my arrival home...\n\nI check out and head home on 7/1. While checking my email on 7/3 I notice an alert from my credit card company. Turns out there are $498.13 of fraudulent on-line charges on my credit card. I've had this card for about 4 years with no issues whatsoever so that struck me as odd. Now I'm not saying that this happen at the Tropicana or even that an employee of the Tropicana is to blame. But, I do find it highly coincidental that this happen. The last two times I've used that card were to book my room with the reservations department and to check in at the hotel.\n\nThere were several pluses about this hotel but the minuses have overshadowed them for me. I will continue to stay at hotels that meet my standard of service( Caesar's, Plant Hollywood, Wynn, etc..) and steer clear of the \""New\"" Tropicana."
1,Lots to eat. Giant burgers with lots of options. I couldnt find the cheese and thought that it needed nore carmelized onions. Took a long time to get my onion rings but the manager comped it because the first ones burnt and my dinner came out with it.  They were huge and very good!   I recommend too as suggested to get milkshakes with the burgers. I got the burnt almond one. It had a little too much whipped cream but was enjoyable.  Place had many empty tables for a weeknight and the popularity. Glad i ordered burger pink and red. Mine was medium rare to rare and red must be raw. \nBased on the reviews I expected the best burger ever. It was large but didnt have the flavor. I couldnt taste the seasoning or the bbq sauce. I would like to try it again. I think the chef had a bad day.
1,"OMG. Cafe Bella used to be at this location and everytime we went in, they were painting or building. The Calabria folks have got it DONE and ready to go. Went for lunch and had the Eggplant Parmagiana sub. It was fantastic. The eggplant was sliced on the vertical, rather than the usual horizontal. Very thinly sliced, lightly breaded and just so freakin' delicious!\n\nHuge portion of the eggplant and incredible marinara sauce on the sub roll, so much that I didn't even touch the roll! It sure looked yummy and was getting rave reviews from my compadres at lunch.\n\nNot ordered, but delivered, a mini cannoli for each of us. Just the perfect end to a scrumptious meal. Atmosphere was nice, very casual...order at counter and they brought out our food. \n\nMamma Mia. That was a great Italian lunch!"
0,"Saw the 25 cent wings advertisement while walking on the Strip with some friends, so we trekked it over at 2 in the morning. \n\n Bottom line: they taste way better when you reheat them in the morning!!"
1,"Everyone at our table had the porcini ribeye. It was delicious, we were all starving from a full day of Vegas, and none of us could clean the plate. You have to appreciate a high class steak house that isn't afraid to give you a huge steak for  a reasonable price just because Gordon Ramsey charges three times as much for half the food in his fancy spot on the strip. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgable. Bartender knew what he was doing, as well. Now that I know about this spot, I might just eat here every time I'm in Vegas."
0,"Ripoff artist. Paid $5,000 to get my leaky foam roof repaired. Tim is a nice guy, shows up on time, speaks knowledgeably, shakes your hand, puts it all in writing. Then he has his crew slop some (white paint?) on your roof. The first rainstorm came and I had massive leaks. Tim came right out and sent the crew back up on the roof. Next rainstorm, more leaks. Tim came out promptly, did some more mysterious things up there. Next rainstorm? Yep, you guessed it, more leaks damaging the interior ceiling repairs I had already had done. I called a real roofing contractor, paid $10,000 for major repairs which included replacing at least half the plywood sheathing, and have not had one drop come in for two years. Tim is a con artist. You want to like him, and he seems so nice showing up in his little red truck with his crew. Don't trust him. The written guarantee you get is his gamble that in dry southern AZ, he can make a lot of trips to your home for the thousands of dollars you paid before you figure out your roof was never repaired."
0,"Ok, this place was really weird. I wanted to like it, but it's very expensive and kind of confusing.\n\nWe got there about 10 minutes before the last call for breakfast orders. Our waitress confirmed we'd still be able to order breakfast. She handed us like four menus, explained nearly every item on each one, and almost all of them had a catch (something missing, etc). Then we got a second waitress who took at least 15 minutes to get to us. We were not allowed to order breakfast.\n\nThe food wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't anything special."
0,"Average. Service is slow inside.  You have to flag someone down if you sit at a table.  Food was so so, price is high for what you get."
1,"Tr\u00e8s bonne adresse pour se jeter sur les grandes marques comme Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger etc.\nTout est \u00e0 plus ou moins 50% par rapport aux prix fran\u00e7ais, sans compter le taux de change du dollar, tr\u00e8s favorable par moments.\nAttention aux tailles ! Le XL am\u00e9ricain c'est du XXL chez nous et il vaut mieux essayer tout avant d'acheter (on peut, le personnel est super aimable).\n\n\n Il est fortement conseiller de s'arr\u00eater ici avant de quitter Vegas, si d\u00e9j\u00e0 on s'est laiss\u00e9 tenter par ce lieu de perdition !"
1,"This review is for their Happy Hour~~ I wish we had late night happy hour in Ca--but only in Vegas right?? They have HH from 4-6 and 11-3am daily and that includes 50% off their special items (they have a big selection to choose from from appetizers, salads, and small meals)... They had a really good selection too!!  You can get a petite fillet mignon (and I mean PETITE--SMALL) & lobster with asparagus for $12-13, which isnt bad for a small bite...try it blackened, its really good..and make sure you order their french onion soup!!! Its delicious..."
1,"I visited last summer and for the price, it was worth the stay. The room, from what I can recall, was very clean. I had no complaints with it. The main reason we decided on staying at this resort is because it was in the center of the strip which was perfect. I hadn't been to Vegas since I was 10 years old, so to me, I thought this hotel was nice and the price was perfect, only paid about $70 a night. I can't remember the name of one of their restaurants(it was Italian), but the food was delicious. Compared to the other hotels, I thought their casino was the least smokey. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would even come back myself."
1,"This office is amazingly accommodating and friendly.  Michelle up front is always a pleasure to talk to, and Dr. Singer and Dr. Fisher are both very knowledgable and easy to get along with.  If you need a chiropractor, you need to come to this office."
0,If I was stoned out of my mind! This place would be the bomb!!  But I was not. So it wasn't. Just a complete disappointment!!! Clean the place up too! I feel like I need a tetanus shot after leaving this place. Gross!!!
0,"The pizza is great, but the wings were awful. They give you sauce on the side instead of adding it to the wings..... What's up with that? The place also smells like it's not well cleaned.... It smells like lingering dirt."
1,"Wow, this hotel is MASSIVE.  You keep walking and walking, and you still aren't through the lobby.  The best part about this hotel is the restaurants.  Everything from Micheal Mina to Joel Roubochon.  I love coming here to see the lions, who are always asleep when I get to the exhibit.  This time we ate at the buffet, which is an old favorite of mine.  I liked all of the food choices, yet again, had an upset stomach later.  Damn buffets."
0,"Staff was wonderful and helpful HOWEVER!\nI am sad to say this hotel's management or ownership is sleeping at the wheel or doing it willfully and just want to make money...I travel from state to state and stay in hampton chains frequently. I am sad to say this may be my last one because I am having more problems with the Hampton brand frequently... I will explain my experience below and farewell goodbye, best I can do is to deprive them of my money and give it to a competitor and so can you!\n\nI checked in and my room didn't seem right at first sight. Bathroom seemed almost empty of amenities and extremely minimalistic with some thin overused towels... however that didn't stop me... the AC unit did... it was so loud you had to be dead not to notice it...yet they rent the room and take my money... so sleep tight campaign is all corporate baloney?  then I looked closely to the bead sheet and it became more suspicious. I can't say with certainty that the sheets where NOT changed from the last visitor but when I had my doubts it became a problem. The bead looked like it was made in a hurry to say the lease and I just had to change rooms.\n\nStaff was helpful and changed my room with no problem. The new room was acceptable at first sight, I was tiered and went to sleep until next morning when I took a shower and as I stepped out and grab the first towel!!!! OMG... it smelled like a cheese fondu out of hell! Holly smelly feet in my face!... I had to take a shower again and carefully inspect the rest of the thin overused towels to make sure I don't do this again...I am not even going to complain about this as I am leaving this room happy to be out and on my way...\n\nFinal draw... I am done! ... Happy stay fellows!"
1,"My first haircut en fran\u00e7ais was a success!\n\nTornade offers $7 for a cut and $12 for cut and style (mise en plis) by their student hairdressers. No worries, the teacher is in the room the whole time, and will sometimes take over to demonstrate a technique or to check the work. My student hairdresser was meticulous and careful and I left with a good cut and beautiful curls.\n\nMy test for a good cut is whether it still looks good after I've washed it myself at home. I'm a low-maintenance gal! And yes, it still looks good.\n\nPhone ahead for an appointment -- I called on Thursday afternoon for an appointment \""next week\"" and was offered a spot on Monday afternoon. The school (like most) is closed on weekends but they do have some evening spots. Some locations (this one included) have a professional salon attached where graduates can earn a chair, and this salon is open weekends. \n\nLeave yourself lots of time. The hairdressers are still learning so a bit of patience is required. You get a head massage while your hair is being washed so this may help get you in a relaxed and patient mood!\n\nThe school offers its courses in French only so if you are a unilingual anglophone you might have difficulty (though of course this is Montreal so many of the students speak English anyway). \n\nYes, I'll be back."
0,"Unfortunately, or fortunately perhaps, I did not get to eat here. I purchase a deal here and the day before it expired I found it. My mom had an accident and couldn't make it .. Called the next day and explained the situation. They didn't care!! They wouldn't even honor the $10 I spent for $20 of food.  Real family run place I guess. Very disappointed!!! Buyer beware!"
1,"For me, Noodles & Company is a nice change of pace, with a good variety to satisfy most people in your party.  I've been here a couple of times, as well as locations in other cities.\n\nI don't disagree, Noodles  may not be the best value for a college student.  Good thing I have a job!  I appreciate the variety offered, with standard American fare (mac and cheese, meatballs) to Asian flare (Japanese noodles, pad thai).  Granted, none of the bowls will astonish you in the taste bud department, but I think it's a nicer option than your other Forbes Ave. choices, such as Chipotle, Primanti's, or Five Guys."
0,Eeewww!!! Skip this place!! The food is gross- no seasoning on anything!! I got a pasta dish - so bland and pointless to eat. My boyfriend got a burger that was way overcooked and the bun was too large to even eat with the meat! Garlic bread was way spicy (why I don't know... Wouldn't expect that to have a kick but my mouth was on fire). I got house wine to drink which seemed like it had been uncorked for a month so the next glass I upgraded which was a bad idea because I could only take a sip of because it was so gross. Never again!!
0,"Fish suppers here are really hit or miss.\n\nSometimes they're quite good- they're always enormous, and when freshly made the batter is crispy and chips are decent.\n\nOther times though they're really not brilliant. I've had old (really fishy) fish, and most recently my fish had been sitting in the warmer for too long (surprising considering it was Friday night at around 8) which left it dry with thick soggy batter.\n\nThe price is very good considering the portion size but after my recent poor supper I was barely able to eat half of it so hardly worth the size."
1,"I've been to Sushi Catcher 4-5 times in the past few months. Have had a rainbow roll, casey roll, and spicy salmon roll. All were very fresh, tasty, and melt in your mouth delicious. The prices are very reasonable, and staff are always friendly and gracious. I have sushi 1-2X/week, and this has become my place to go in the Phoenix area."
0,"Stopped by for lunch today with my son.  He likes chinese food, and he likes this place.  So instead of going to subway (my first choice) I decided to take him where he likes.\n\nWe've eaten here more than a few times.  Once was even close to closing time, and they happily made fresh items as they were out of a few things.  Today when we get there, they were not busy at all and as usual for a slow time, not all the items were full.  No biggie, I know they'll make more if need be, but it's always kind of weird to see a huge pan only half/quarter full of items.\n\nMy son had the Orange chicken with chow mein and I had Orange chicken, kung pao and fried rice.\n\nThe rice and chow mein were good.  My kung pao chicken had something burnt in it. I couldn't tell want was burnt, but I could taste it.  I finished my orange chicken, which seemed really dry this time, and took a bite of my son's.  I had to spit the whole piece out, it still had a huge section of bone in it.  The sweet and sour sauce seemed watered down.\n\nAs we were finishing up eating, my 11 y/o son looks at me and says \""dang dad, chop chop has really gone down hill\"", I had to agree with him.\n\nI'm not sure if this was just an off day for them, or if it was just the slow lunch hour, but I'll likely think twice before I spend money here again."
1,"We went here last night with some friends and our whole dining experience was superb! \n\nI looked on Yelp beforehand and got the feeling this place was a hit or miss. Luckily it was a total HIT for us! \n\nYou have to try it for yourself, forget the bad comments!\n\nWe shared a Cesar salad before our meal and that was a perfect size for both of us. If we had each ordered a dinner salad instead of sharing, we would have been way too full to eat our dinners. Keep in mind they also give you bread sticks, Olive Garden-type, along with olive oil and vinegar before your meal. \n\nI ordered the Seafood Linguine and my husband ordered the Meat Rigatoni. We were both very pleased with the taste, price and size of our meals! Very Generous portions of pasta, enough to take home and eat the other half later, or share 1 entree for 2 people. \n\nMy entree was very tasty and had plenty of seafood! My husband loves meat, usually there isn't enough in any entree. He commented that there was too much for him to eat. \n\nThe service was awesome, the food was delicious and the ambiance was perfect! I would highly recommend, and we will be going back for sure!"
1,"I absolutely love this shop.  When they first opened I picked up some stellar sunglasses from them.  Recently, I was delighted to find that they accept my eye insurance. Prime!  They carry a unique selection of frames that help all us Phoenicians look cool. And they are so nice.  Check them out!  A+++++"
1,"Le $$$$$$$\n\nBeautiful small venue with a top notch view of the water show and impeccable service. Superb French cuisine and a must have is the truffled risotto...holyyyy a last meal request & if not it will be after you get the bill at the end. And I'm glad I wasn't aware of the miniature dessert tray they bring \""gratis\"" at the end or I would have never indulged in the unbelievable desserts like the chocolate egg that opens up with the hot chocolate poured over the top (amazing presentation) or the frozen bowl of ice with strawberries and cream! I felt like royalty there!\n\n\nMy only disappointment is there was no miniature monkey swinging from the ceiling walking a tight rope or on the trapeze."
0,"I've been here a couple of times and I still don't get the hype. The food is decent but nothing special compared to any other Tex-Mex restaurants in Charlotte. Their tableside guacamole was good and they did make it very spicy like we asked. And their jalepeno margaritas are delicious. But their actual dishes are just whatever. \n\nOne reason I'm knocking them down to two stars is their service. The first time I went, the girl seemed very irritated that we were in there so late (only an hour and a half before they closed. Geez). The second time, the guy kept acting like any request we made was a joke. \""can we get the tableside guac?\"" \""ha...sure. ....oh really?\"" i know it was kind of busy but we are very patient and very good tippers so we were serious. Then when I asked for a box for my quesadillas, I also asked for a side of sour cream and salsa. (to which he replied \""to eat here? Hahah ok?\"" \""no....for home\"" what a weird question) The box came out about 15 minutes later and was just thrown down as he was walking to the next table. I then had to ask for the sides again. We had already paid and everything and after another 15 minutes of nothing, we just left.\n\nI want to give them one more chance as far as service goes bc it's the only neighborhood Mexican restaurant and I want to experience what everyone else has experienced. But I'm serious...one more chance.."
0,The casino stinks of smoke. The steak house is good and great food but the rooms have nicked and broken furniture in the suite rooms. I realize times in Vegas are bad but there is a point that you need to invest in you hotel.\n\nThis place is an ashtray. 10 minutes in the casino is like smoking 2 packs of cigarettes. Even our dealer was complaining and have a hard time breathing.\n\nBoyd gaming should be ashamed of this dump hotel. \n\nOne last thing the coffee shop sucks
1,"A fun and easy way to go between parts of the Vegas strip.  This price is cheaper than using a taxi if you plan to move between casinos on opposite sides of the strip quickly.  Wish it had a stop at each of the casinos on this side, but for what it does and nominal fee, it works."
0,"I'm writing this on my laptop as I sit on the toilet - it has been less than 1 hour since I ate there. This is round 2 of what I predict will be at least a 3 round battle between my stomach and Moe's *courtesy flush*. My girlfriend is currently having her own private battle in the other bathroom.\n\nI had a steak burrito and she had a chicken burrito. I didn't eat beans or rice and she did. The only things we had the same were the tortilla, the chips, the cheese, and the diet soda... why we are both ill off this, I don't really know. I started to feel the 'gut rot' as I took my last bite. \n\nThe steak tasted somewhat odd - I figured it was the sauce it was soaking in... the meat was very drippy and soggy. The chips were stale and bland and looked like they came out of a bag. I'm told the chicken was pretty mediocre. \n\nThe fake-nice we encountered when we walked in was kinda irritating to me, but I'm sure it's fun if you're in that kind of mood. I guess I wasn't. The atmosphere was less than special as well. It reminded me of Peter Piper Pizza.\n\nI think the problem is that I went to Chipotle before ever going to Moe's. I was spoiled. Fresh ingredients, much of it organic, and a classy atmosphere. Moe's is just barely a half-step above Taco Bell, but with Chipotle prices. \n\nI understand that this place is really busy during lunch, and I went in the evening - perhaps when it's busier, the food is better?\n\nI'm never going back - apart from the food giving me assplosions, it tasted pretty awful (especially compared to Chipotle). Anyway - this place sucks... boo-hiss."
0,"I took my cat in to be boarded for a few days and to get neutered. When he came home he was very lethargic and wouldn't eat or drink. He actually wouldn't even really move and would hide under the covers all day which he never did before.\n\nI assumed this was all normal considering all he had been through and we had just moved into a new apartment. \n\nWell, I noticed last night that he was licking at a huge laceration on his lower abdomen. I must not have noticed it before because he has long hair and must've been keeping it clean and had been hiding so much.\n\nI called the vet and all she could say is that it's unfortunate that he was hurt and it didn't happen there. I know it sure didn't happen in my apt bc I literally took him from the vet to the new empty apt that still has no furniture so there is nothin sharp. I only have an air mattress and I've checked to make sure there aren't any sharp objects anywhere.\n\nSo now my poor cat just had his second surgery in 7 days and is so traumatized. I definitely didn't take him back but to another vet. Beware!!!!"
0,"Burger was pretty tasteless. I expected a super juicy, greasy burger based on the name of the place. definitely not worth the price. Interesting experience *maybe* one time only."
1,"It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner."
1,"I read earlier reviews and had to check to make sure we were all talking about the same place. I went to Cafe Aroma with my 11-year-old son and had a great experience. The place was packed (right at noon), but our food still arrived timely and fresh. It isn't a fast food restaurant ... everything is cooked as it's ordered, so I do make allowances for that. \n\nI ordered a veggie wrap, and it was SO, SO good! I'm picky about my veggies, but they were fresh (not frozen or canned) and it was really delicious. I asked for feta instead of cheddar, and it was perfect. \n\nMy son ordered a burger, and he thought it was one of the best restaurant burgers he's had. \n\nThe staff was really friendly, and it felt like a down-home kind of friendly place. \n\nWe'll be going back, for sure. I'm glad Cafe Aroma is in Anthem, so close to us!"
1,"Pf changs is pretty good, there changs spicy chicken is a really good dish, the service is great! I go there almost every two weeks."
1,"FINALLY! I have found a place where I can truly enjoy a nice bowl of pho! If you know anything about my pho searching journey in Vegas, you'd know that I've been pretty disappointed with every experience I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant thus far. But eureka! Pho Annie does it for me. \n\nFirst off, we need to cover location because it is not an easy find. Complex is rather odd. It's almost like the complex curves toward the street with Pho Annie tucked on the inside hidden from the street view.  Just look for Chee Burger Chee Burger, it's in the same complex.\n\nRestaurant isn't large 5-6 booths on the left, 3-4 tables on the right. First visit was during lunch and it got packed fast. Second visit was on a Sunday night and it was much slower. I order the Annie Special pho that includes all meat additions (tripe, fatty brisket, tendon, meat balls, flank). In Houston, we are given the option of small bowls or large bowls for pho and this would definitely be considered as the large bowl. The bowl costs around $7. I order the egg rolls as an appetizer and they're great -- comes with 4 large egg rolls. Keep in mind pho doesn't take long to prepare at all so your main course will most likely follow the app within 5-10 minutes. \n\nIt's really hard to describe the taste of the broth. All I can really say is that I truly enjoyed it. It had the perfect amount of flavor and I actually sipped on it after I ate up everything else. \n\nAnd if pho isn't your thing, they have a wide selection of other dishes. Can't go too much in detail of that for ya cause I didn't pay close attention.. sorry!\n\nMy favorite pho place so far! The only downfall is you have to spend a minimum of $10 to use your credit card."
0,"Drove through this one today determined to try one of the thick yellow Lemonade's I always see advertised. I ordered a large and drove up to the window. What I got was a solid white concoction and very watery. I took a sip and not only was it barely cool in temperature, but tasted like a solid block of sugar. No lemon to be found anywhere, and certainly not the thick cold looking drink advertised.  I knocked on the drive thru window repeatedly as the girl who waited on me had closed it, for what seemed like an eternity. When she finally came to the window with a disdainful look on her face asking what I wanted.  I explained the issue and not only did she not offer to remake it, she seemed pissed that I had a beef. When I suggested an Orange Julius instead or something comparable, she only pointed out the higher price difference. I then asked for a large diet soda, which she obliged but didn't bother to refund the difference in price. (I should have got back at least .40 cents) Clearly the advertised product and what you will find waiting for you at the window are two different things. I guess what made me the most dissatisfied is her complete lack of interest in giving me what I paid for, and essentially a \""what do you want me to do about it\"" attitude. Does this place even have a manager? I wonder. Clearly customer service is not something they strive for here. And management if you're reading this, here's a tip; If you're going to advertise a THICK, COLD, LEMON drink, you need to deliver. What was handed to me today was pathetic, not to mention the crappy customer service. I won't be back."
0,"This used to be our go-to pizza delivery, but lately it's just not as good.  Last time the pizza was a bit underdone and it took FOREVER to be delivered.  So, we gave up and eventually went back to Bado's.  I'm guessing during off-peak times, it's still okay.  But be warned if you try to order during dinner time on a Friday night..."
1,"Dropped in here at 11 AM today, a weekday, & this place was already roaring busy!  After a short wait, I was seated in a very comfortable spot, & soon not only chips & salsa arrived, but a cup of Fideo Soup!  Now I don't care too much for this style of salsa, hot & plain, but the soup was a delicious treat!\n\nSo I ordered, & pretty soon a big, hot platter showed up with my Combo of a Chile Relleno, covered with a different red salsa, a chicken enchilada covered with green salsa, cheese covered refried beans, & Spanish Rice.\n\nI loved everything but the salsa, the service was excellent, & the price reasonable at $8.95.  I'll be back!\n\nPS:  They open at 8 AM, daily specials, no separate checks, park in paved parking lot only!"
0,"Been coming here for years, first time I have felt threatened downtown this time by their head of security.\nNew policy as of today, $5 for parking.  Complained at players club, so they called head of security who said he disagreed with me.  They finally called casino manager who refunded my $5.  \nNo signs on parking fee, girl at garage barely spoke English, abrasives security manager.  Time to spend my money elsewhere."
0,"Steer clear from this poor excuse for a restaurant. I have dined at many restaurants, many Chinese restaurants that serve dim sum and this is the worst place I have been to. It starts with the water, want ice water? Great! It's straight from the tap and by tap, it's faucet water. The food? Like reheated bland food? Great! Everything not only looks reheated, it tastes reheated! Save your money, save your precious time and most of all, save yourself from bad Chinese food. Do not go here. Want great dim sum in Vegas? Then head to....well, anywhere else."
1,"We went with our boys and another family, and the dinner was delightful. After a 30 minute wait, we were seated and got friendly and attentive service for the entire meal. We ordered the panong coconut curry with shrimp, brown rice bowls (one chicken and one beef), and the kids pizza. The bowls were delicious - wonderfully flavorful and fresh veggies, tender steak and chicken, brown rice cooked to perfection, curry that had a perfectly mild punch. \n\nFor dessert we had the squash pie and flourless chocolate cake. The pie came with coconut whipped cream and we added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My husband loved it. The chocolate cake was fantastic, with little chocolate shavings and a touch of caramel. We will definitely go back when we are here again."
0,"I've heard a lot of rave reviews for the Kauai Chicken, so I had to try it for myself. I decided to do a takeout. It was Tuesday around 11:43a and had only 3 people there, two one one table and a single diner. I waited about 5 minutes then my order was ready. I couldn't wait till I got home, thinking about the great chicken I was going to devour. I got home and opened the cover and had 1 quarter piece and 1 thigh. Took a bite of the thigh and almost spit it out. The inside never look fresh and it was really oily. By oily, there was a ton of cooking oil at the bottom of the plate. I took a bite of the quarter piece .. the drumstick to be exact and it tasted the same. The meat fell off the bone, but it didn't taste freshly cooked. It looked like they fried the chicken ahead of time and then refrigerated it until someone ordered it, then put it in the fryer again. The color of the chicken meat wasn't white, it was a greyish color. I know my chicken and that chicken wasn't cooked fresh. That's why my order was given to me in less than 5 minutes! The only thing I enjoyed was the mac salad .. not too much mayo and the mac not overcooked. The rice was perfect and just enough. Only problem was the main dish. I hope these guys not cutting corners since the restaurant should be busy around this time. I hope they shape up before it's too late cause I want to see them succeed because they the only one close to where I live. I normally take the long drive to Ross J's or Island Style. Looks like I make that trek if I want good food."
1,"This wingstop is awesome! Boneless Mondays and Tuesdays are a bargain. Plus they give military discount on these days too! The wings are bigger size than Buffalo Wild Wings which is very refreshing, you get more bang for your buck! Congratulations on a job well done! (As said in the Navy)"
0,"If you're already a regular here, congratulations you're getting great service. If they don't recognize you, good luck. It's not just my party, it's throughout the bar. A pedestrian beer selection and an unimpressive menu with horrible service. You've been warned."
1,Wow. Great sushi! All you can eat for 26 bucks! Make sure to get your money's worth! I came her with my girlfriend and got AYCE and we got a lot of half rolls and figured the price of the meal would just come out to the price of AYCE. \nWe sat at the sushi bar and had Fredo(?) as our sushi chef. Really cool guy and really friendly. He recommended things to use and everything tasted great. \nYOU MUST get the grilled cajun salmon! It only comes in a small bit size so order about two for yourself. The chocolate moose was the only desert we tried and it was amazing. Also get the grilled veggies. Whatever butter they put is really tasty!!\nThe server was great too. There's about three that bus the sushi bar and grab drinks and one of them takes your order that doesn't get made by the sushi chefs. Super quick service!\nIf you do AYCE 10 times you get the 11th free!\nOh and a Sunday night the wait was about 45 minutes for two people. The place is small and super packed. Make sure to say you will sit in either a booth or table so if either opens up you'll get seated faster
1,"I took my car here after finding a big screw in one of my tires. They didn't charge anything to pull it out and patch the hole. I insisted on paying something but received a \""I couldn't charge you with anything even if I wanted to.\""  Very friendly staff.  I was out the door in 20 minutes."
1,"We were in the mood for a traditional vietnamese family food. Therefore, we ordered Ca canh chua (sour soup with catfish) and Ca kho to (salty braised catfish). The food came out hot and tasted yummy..the soup was kinda Thai tom-yum-Kum broth base, but it was spicy and very hearty. The braised fish was great, not too salty. Overall, the food is good and the services are very friendly."
0,"I really wanted to LOVE this place because of all the good reviews here and because of the reviews is why we went there tonight. Sometimes I wonder if relatives give these places the 4-5 star reviews. \nI will say the place was clean and tidy and the counter girl was pleasant. I don't like cafeteria style restaurants, especially at $12.00 a plate. Only thing good about an order yourself place is I don't tip. \nI ordered the BBQ pork and it was bbq'd right to the skewer so I had to eat it with my hands. It was over cooked, rubbery and way to thin. However, it did have a good flavor. The macaroni salad was very good and they were happy to replace the rice with a green salad at no extra cost.  The short ribs were very tough and cut thin, again the flavor was good. The coconut shrimp tasted like it was just ordinary frozen restaurant fare, nothing special. I really wanted to like this place as we need more family run places and not chain eateries. We were there from 5:30 to 6:30 and we were the only ones in the place the whole time. Too bad. Oh yeah, it took a long time to get our food being we were the only patrons . I may try it again and order the chicken."
0,"Not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars.  I gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere.  I live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular Mexican place was closed, salsa cabana. \n\nI had the chicken chimi with rice and beans. It was ok, could have been better, temp of food was warm not hot.  Wife had the veggie burrito.  This was a bean burro with lettuce?  The rice and beans were bland.  This place is not for me, I like my Mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell. Wait I would have gave taco bell 3 stars because it's fast food Mexican and I know what to expect there.  \n\nWe had to buy chips and salsa, really?  Every Mexican food restaurant gives you this. For me this is why I go to get Mexican food."
0,"Do not EVER TAKE YOUR COMPUTER TO FRYS FOR SERVICE!!!  PROMISE!!!!   NEVER EVER!  Unless you want it ruined, broken and all your data lost.  Go anywhere else or to a friend.  I've had computers break before and had them fixed and data recovered no problem.  I went to Frys because their prices were slightly better. Their service signs say A+ rated technicians. BULLSHIT.  I would of rather payed DOUBLE and have my computer and data. \nMy desktop computer broke during a move.  they were supposed to remove the hard drive and save my files to a flash drive.  They suggested putting my files in a separate \""folder\"" on my laptop that they were also repairing.  the files were all jumbled up and when they later killed my laptop, they were now lost.

0,"Hm, not sure why this place got such high reviews...maybe because most people were tipsy when coming here?  Well, we came here sober cuz we wanted really good tacos and read all the rave reviews.  I told myself and my bf (who was the one who wanted to come here) that driving in Vegas traffic and waiting in this extremely long line better be worth it.  Well sorry my friends, it was sadly not!  It took us about a half hour in the line outside to get to the line inside, lol.  We ordered the spicy pork tacos and a quesadilla and both were just ok - I've had a lot better elsewhere.  Apparently the spicy pork tacos are supposed to be kickass here but for me, they were only meh.  Have you guys ever had really good tacos??!  My theory is that there's not many good taco places on the strip and that's why all the rave reviews?  Who knows, but I'm definitely not coming back here again..."
0,Been here a few times.  I'm not a big Denny's fan but choices are limited in San Tan area.  Always expect a wait on weekends.  But staff seems to try their best to get you seated quickly.  Food is average.  Service though I think is sub-par.  I get the sense the place is not managed well.  However I see from another reviewer maybe they have new management and things have improved?  Not sure.  I'm willing to try again but not enthused about going back.  \n\nMy most recent visit was about 2 months ago.  It took forever to get our food.  Our waitress claimed to have checked on our order and said it would be right out.  This was after about 20-30 min.  Then a manager came over and checked on our order.  He apologized and said it was being worked on now.  So implication is our waitress did not check our order and it was lost or not put in.  Not good.  I think that explains why I have not been back since.
0,"My roommate (who is disabled) and I stayed at this hotel for Christmas, and it was the worst experience ever. \n\n(1) The hotel room (paradise tower room) was filthy and did not look like the floor was vacuumed at all. There was a jelly bean, hair, papers on the floor and a big stain on the carpet. And the table in the room was so wobbly.\n\n(2) They gave out a coupon for lobster meal for a new customer. We asked the guy at the information booth where the restaurant was, and he told us that restaurant was under renovation so we could not use the coupons. So we had to go to the other hotel and spent over $100 for lobster dinner while we could have only spent only $50 with coupons at Tropicana. Then later we found out that we could have used the coupon at the different restaurant located in Tropicana, and the guy gave us wrong information was not even an employee for the hotel.\n\n(3) It said we get free tickets for Hypnosis show by booking a room at Tropicana, so we planned on going, but they canceled the show at last minute. We could not see the show on different night because we already planned to go to a different show.\n\n(4) My roommate is disabled and has a help dog (with proper paperwork). We called in advance to let them know that we would bring a dog, and also informed at the front desk and security when cheking in, and they said no problem. But when Orbitz called the hotel regaring our complaints, they lied that we brought a dog even though animals were not allowed.  \n\n(5) The food at the buffet was terrible, by far one of the most disgusting food we ever tasted in our lives. Bread and food was so dry and tasted like cardboard and water tasted like chlorine. We got sick from eating.\n\nI will NEVER EVER go back to this hotel even after renovation and NEVER recommend this hotel for anyone!! (The only good thing I can think of about this hotel is the location)\nIf you want to save money, stay at Motel 6 instead (which is about a block away from the strip) and I'm sure it's much better than the filthy room and lousy service at Tropicana. Or pay a little extra to stay at different casino hotels."
1,"Best pizza we've had in a long time! The ambiance is beautiful, the service is great! I had a mixed drink that was delicious & my husband and I shared two pizzas that were both perfectly delicious. Highly recommend!"
0,Went for breakfast. Food was precooked sitting out cold. Eggs cold-bacon cold. The only thing hot was the coffee. Yes it was inexpensive but horrible.
1,"Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly. \n\nBottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle, it didn't sting that I forgot to bring my own water.\n\nPark rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.\n\nWear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered - maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semi-famous hipster's Flickr!"
1,"I reeeeeeally needed new tires. Despite being fully aware of this, I took a 50-mile bumpy-ass dirt road into the middle of Death Valley to a remote hot springs. There was no cell service, and I carried no spare -- what can I say, I like to live on the edge :)\n\nSure enough, I hadn't been back in town more than a few days when I blew out a tire. Thank dog it didn't happen in the middle of Death Valley! I went over to the Big O on Jones & Desert Inn, where I've been going for years...but unfortunately the place was closed, because the cool-ass man who ran it had passed away :(\n\nSo I went to another Big O, which shall remain nameless...and after upselling me on needless services (transmission fluid, power steering fluid and brake fluid flushes), the guy had the chutzpah to call me up the next day and ask me out on a date!!\n\nNow I can't fault the guy for asking me out -- after all, my usual m.o. when going in for automotive work is to wear skimpy clothes in order to wangle the best deal from the grease monkeys. But to rip me off and THEN have the balls to ask me out?! Inconceivable!\n\nI know they ripped me off, because my regular oil-change guy later told me he'd just changed my power steering fluid a few months prior...so it DEFINITELY did not need flushing. Lesson learned: check records before agreeing to services!\n\nAnyhoo, now I decided to get a full set of new tires, just in case. But I sure as hell wasn't going back to Big O! Someone recommended Discount Tire, so I went and checked it out.\n\nThe staff was courteous, the waiting room was airy, clean, and stocked with lots of magazines, and one of the grease monkeys offered me a bottle of water while I waited. The total cost for all the tires only came to $340, and I was in and out within 30 minutes.\n\nThis all just happened today, so I'm still waiting to see if these insanely cheap tires blow up prematurely. I'm also waiting to see if anyone calls to ask me out! \n\nBarring those eventualities...this place rocks!"
1,"I was highly surprised by how good the food was. It does come off as being an oversized dive bar, but I'm cool with that. We went in on a Saturday in between lunch & dinner & we were the only ones eating! I ordered a veggie sandwich which was yummy & my husband's fish tacos were just as good. Our server was extremely friendly & made sure our visit was a great one. If you're looking for an unpacked local friendly bar/restaurant with no wait time & great prices, this should be your stop when in Vegas (we used a groupon & are from Cali) We'll be back again!"
1,"This is the former Merchandise Mart on Independence. I just attended the Southern Christmas Show here the other night. Great place. It's HUGE! The Christmas show has been here for years. Lots of arts, crafts, food & festive stuff. A  Christmas shopaholic's dream, a husband's nightmare! Plenty of parking ($6 to park) and tickets to the show are just $7.50 at all Harris Teeters with a Vic card ( I knew they were good for something). This place has all kinds of expos & shows throughout the year. The Southern Christmas Show is a great way to get into the holiday spirit!"
0,"Disappointed is the theme of this review. Mexican food? Where? I was served some hipster doofus version of \""upscale Mexican fare.\"" How does a Mexican Restaurant effectively mess up beans and rice? \n\nDon't expect chips and salsa. Unless you would like to pay $3.50 for 3 tablespoons of \""salsa\"" and a handful of chips... you are out of luck my friend. It's not about the $3.50, I knew the price when I ordered it. It's not about the fact that I'm served free chips and salsa at the vast majority of Mexican places I've patronized. It IS about the portion for the price. Are you kidding me with this shit? \n\n\""Pretentious Mexican food\"" is about as paradoxical as it gets. Skip it folks. You've been warned."
1,"My father and I always come here to get any of our watches fixed and to put new batteries when they need to be replaced. \n\nI honestly haven't had any bad service here. I had a metal band repaired on my delicate watch that was broken off and was missing a tiny rod to link it together. It took them a few days to fix and now it's like brand new all over again.\n\nI stopped by today to replace batteries for three of my watches, since I only use them when I need to and it's that \""time\"" again haha get it?!?! :) Eh ok anyways... my comedian days have retired.. back to the review.\n\nIt took only a few minutes and they put each watch in a plastic zip lock pouch. Each battery replacement cost $10.75, he says it should be replaced every year and a half, but it should be good for up to 5 years. My watches only go as long as just over a year. \n\nThe service is always prompt and friendly. They are always very helpful with any questions you may have. I'm surprised with the low rating on this place, because I haven't ever received that kind of treatment nor my Father from being loyal customers for many years now.\n\nThere are times where it can be very busy and other times maybe only two people and yourself... but every time I come in here and wait... there's always someone else that's been a regular of this place for many years too.\n\nIt's located right on the corner of Valley View and Spring Mtn. Rd., right by Kung Fu Thai and Chinese Restaurant. If you miss the entry to get in... you can go in the alley after it and just go around again. \n\nHope this helps anybody in need of getting their watch repaired or batteries replaced."
1,"WOW I'm so glad we found an awesome Chinese food place!!! I was so tired of all the other dirty, slow, bad food places. The food is delicious and they give you a lot! Every time I order I have lunch and a snack for the next day! The prices are really good too. You will not find any other place that offers this amazing food at a great price. Give up your search and step in here or order for pickup/delivery. You won't regret it!!!"
1,"Okay, my boyfriend and I are big breakfast fans. This is our favorite casual breakfast place. I've probably eaten here about 40 times and I have never been let down. I have tried many things but my two favorites are the Country Benny..its Eggs Benedict with a biscuit and sausage and gravy on top. I'm sure its about 5,000 calories but well worth it especially when you are hung over. My other favorite is the El Vaquero...its a chorizo omelette with salsa and cheese on top. Amazing! I know they are owned by the same people, but this one is far better than the one on Rainbow."
1,"For sure, I had to go here for lunch since more people have gone for dinner. The lines are still long!  I asked the server what she thought was the main difference = no sushi.  They had CA rolls but no fish on top of rice.  But I made do with poke (totally hit the spot), oxtail soup (ok), fried clams, sweet potatoes (exceptionally good), prime rib (deliteful), rotisserie chicken (piping hot as he just brought it out), thai curry with mussels (so so).  I sampled the hummus, baba ganoush, guac, salsa to find it was all very good.  I'm not going to name all the gourmet desserts I tried since they were all A1 & I will need to leave more room.  But with 3 people eating lunch, I could have a bite of many & with no repercussions!!!!  All exclaimed this was a worthy lunch buffet (esp since it's a hike from the LV 'burbs)."
0,"Last night I took time out of my evening to drop in Fry's Electronics on Baseline to LOOK at some cameras. I've done a lot of research online but I can't get a couple questions answered without handling the merchandise.  I went here because they have an above average selection of cameras.  Unfortunately less than half of them had power to check and find out what I want to know.  Not one single Nikon camera in my price range had power.  What the heck!  The ONLY REASON I went here was to see, touch, experience the cameras.  It's the ONLY REASON I couldn't do everything online.  I was very disappointed with Fry's last night.  It had been a couple years since I was in that store.  It will probably be many more years before I visit them again.\n\nPS. They now price match all online pricing.  That's cool, still it's less convenient than shopping at home in my jammies!"
0,"Made the appointment with no issues, got windows measured for sun screens and got a resonable quote.  I told the service guy that I would call him back to make an appt for installation.  He left me the owners card with owner info on it.  I called 2 times and left voice mails and even emailed and STILL have not gotten a response.  So.. I am off to find another screen person.  Boo!"
1,McDuffy's is my hang out...just like Cheers... Everyone knows your name!!! Service is great... Never waiting on a beer...food is great....grilled honey chipotle wings....burgers....sandwiches.... All salad dressings are home made.... Nachos are huge.... Kudos to all the staff!!! You are all awesome!!!!

1,"Just updating from my last visit there.. the snow is awesome! It looks nice and tastes good. But from my last visit, the guy who was working behind the counter started yelling at the customer that was just eating and apparently doing something that was bothering the employee (or the owner I might say). Like YELLING. Its none of my business but it made me feel REAL uncomfortable and I was so scared! I felt like he was gonna start fighting him! Lol. I was ordering and he just started yelling like in a rudish way. So I was at the counter just waiting until he was finished and so I can complete my order. My dad actually went inside with me because he heard the yelling and pointing & he was worried. I'd still come back though maybe..."
0,"It's not bad, but there is nothing that stands out, either. Breakfast was fine, but expensive. Service was fine. It's okay if you are staying in the hotel, but 100% NOT worth a special trip."
0,"Never again !\n\nThe fish here is as cheap as you can get, pre-fabricated fish squares that are slightly better than McDonald's filet-o-fish. The shrimp that I ordered were flat, like pounded out flat, who knows what this crap was. The fries  were limp and flavorless. The only thing that made this any better was the \""special sauce\"", which I believe to be hot sauce & ketchup.\n\nThis place is SUPER cheap and the food reflects why. There is no reason I will ever eat here again, peace out Pete's !"
0,"I was extremely excited to finally eat here! in the end.. I was very disappointed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I love oysters! Being an oyster bar we thought it must be fresh and delicious! Holy crap was the oysters shitty!  We could not believe how dirty the oysters were! They did not take the liberty to rinse or scrub the oysters shells before prying them open.  I do not think they were fresh! We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.  It was already hard enough trying to eat the dirty oysters..after eating the bad one we noticed the couple others didn't look good.  The worker at the end never took our plate away until the end asking if we were going to finish it.. yeah we just said no.  There's something wrong there if we did not finish it buddy!  We watched them open the oysters after and saw how dirty the shells were and noticed that the shells had bands around them to keep the oysters from opening.  THIS PLACE IS NOT KNOWN FOR THE OYSTERS!\n\nWe also had New England Clam Chowder and Chicken Gumbo.  These came out a lot better.  I've never had Gumbo but my boyfriend said it was decently good.  I am a fan of clam chowder, and it was good, nothing amazing.  So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.\n\nThe service, it was mehhh.  I swear the cook in front of us looked miserable, took some time for us to have a server attend to us the couple times we needed something..\n\nDefinitely will not be back.."
0,"we came for the night club and it was not impressive, most of the customers are obese,huge,gigantic,oversize,extra extra=extra large and the music they play are most boring,not motivated to dance. they do not serve food after 11;00 PM. GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T SERVE FOOD FOR THESE PEOPLE"
0,"I thought everyone's opinion made this a safe place to live it up..... Wrong.\n Didn't try the food, thank God, as the small house payment for two coffees smaller than a senior cup at McDonalds was horrifying enough!\n As we waited for our coffee every employee in the place approached us at least twice to try to seat us. Not in a solicitous way, more of a creepy, boss stalker way.\n Wouldn't go back for a free crepe, luckily I don't think they would offer. A crepe is probably more costly than most vacations.\n It tasted ok, but was $9 for what was seriously less than 1/2 cup TOTAL coffee in two cups.\n Even the server apologized that my tiny cup was mostly empty. I think cocaine us cheaper."
1,"I never really understood what the big deal was with crepes, but the Crepe Bar made a believer out of me. \n\nThe menu is basic, but that simplicity also makes it classic. There are three sweet crepes - nutella and bananas, cream and berries, and a house special of cr\u00e8me brulee. The savory crepes include a burrito and a few others (sorry, can't remember!). Husband and I ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte. As we waited for our food, we watched the burrito go by and decided we'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split. My latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top, delivered by a smiling employee. First sip - heavenly. (One of the better lattes I've had recently and I'm a coffee snob.) Quickly our crepes followed, looking beautiful on pristine, white plates. There were strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy, but definitely filling. Husband requested caramel be drizzled over his, adding a sweeter taste to his crepe. Crepe was light and airy, no crispy edges and just sweet enough. The cream and berries were definitely fresh.\n\nThe location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic. Committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food, it's gotta be good, right? Damn straight. The inside is a bit sparse, I don't remember any wall art, but there are plenty of tables and chairs. On the steel counter top, instead of a regular cash register, they use an iPad - which gives them cool techie cred. You can also see the chef at work, which is nice to see where the food comes from. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to take your date, relatives, friends, maybe even strangers - just gather them all up and prepare for deliciousness."
1,"Vegas is sure enough, already pricey, and what I hate is it's all about the looks and not exactly the food. I love Houston food, yet has any place been able to compare with houston food for me or bigger than that...Texas, but then again I haven't traveled to many states. Julian Serrano was an exception though, although I hated that the paella was pretty expensive and the shrinp/lobster wasn't shelled out already, customwer service was great...food was finally something better, more on your busdget...but remember small plates..so in a way it seems cheap, but the plates are really small, unless you don't have an appetite this would be a good budget restaurant...the steak was really good and juicy. I recommend it, because unlike other restaurants in Vegas, this was one little one that served better foods than most restaurants in my opinion, although no foodss taste bad, some foods were okay, of course."
0,"Overpriced, delivery took an eternity, pizza was half smashed, wings tasted like they were days old and not even remotely close to being edible.  too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.  Skip it."
1,"This is one of my regular stops, especially on Thursday, which is Prime Rib night (8.99/8 oz and also specials on larger cuts).  I also have the Ladies card which nets you 25% off AND there's a good happy hour!\n\nKind of in an out of the way spot (unless you're local to the neighborhood).  Very nice on the inside and has plenty of tvs and comfy seating, a large bar, separate dining room and a pool table.  BIG PLUS - although there is gaming at the bar, there's plenty of non-gaming seats at the bar as well.  I love this. It's one of my pet peeves to go to a bar and not be able to sit because i'm not a gamer.\n\nFood:   Food is decent, but honestly not always my first choice for dining.  They recently revamped the menu and took some of my favorites off.  I go for the prime rib night and it's definitely worth the money.  It's tender, tasty and a great price.\n\nDrinks:  I don't often drink beer here but they have an ok selection on tap and in bottles.   I normally drink mixed drinks and have been pleased with what I've had.  I also have liked many of the \""special\"" drinks that BJs has such as the Marilyn Monroe Vodka with fresh strawberries and lemonade.  I've allowed the bartenders to just create something for me and have never been disappointed.\n\nService - From the first day until now (over a year later), the bartenders have been super friendly, fun, and provided fantastic service, especially Stephanie, Elizabeth, Julia, and Joe.  Drea rocks the food service.  They are there to make sure you have a beverage and a good time.  I've never seen them be less than gracious to any and every one who walks through the door.  Their capacity for remembering everyone is unreal.   I have been in there on happy hour when it's been crazy and they still make everyone feel like they are getting personalized attention.  They are wonderful.\n\nOverall a fun and friendly hangout that won't break the bank."
1,"Awesome way to end a night of drinking - filling, just greasy enough and decently cheap.\n\nThey also offer delivery and a number of healtier options that make it a good choice for a normal dinner as well...\n\nAlso, the pita chips and babaganoush are amazing."
1,They have a decent menu and really good prices.  You do get a decent amount of food for the price that you pay.  The Fried Ice Cream is the best that I have had in my opinion!
0,"Save your money, and don't go here.\nThis place is so stuck up!\nWe went in there, and walked the entire store, and NOT A SINGLE person acknowledged us. The sales people were NOT busy, chit chatting with each other about outside of work topics.\n\nNo thanks."
0,"Besides being ridiculously rude, they have very inflated prices. If you are near it and have no other options that's the only time I'd recommend them. Even then I'd say walk the distance to the Safeway down the street."
0,"Drove by this place and although sign says open looks like they are under construction. Food is extremely bland and for the healthy option they have no brown rice. They do not do any substitutes nor can they make anything spicy they just bring you hot chili on the side. First and last time here. Although service was great, lunch food terrible."
0,"If I could give this company Zero stars I would. \nI signed up with them in October of 2011. It took until May of 2012 for my installation to be complete. Building inspectors and APS inspectors showed up randomly to meet with them at my property and they never bothered to show up. This happened about four times. Even the building inspectors were exasperated by the end. \nA year after installation I noticed I wasn't producing what I should based on the contract and called Sunpower (manufacturer of the system). It took over 6 weeks for Arizona Solar Concepts to send someone out, and that was after I called weekly and finally sent a letter to Sunpower threatening Arbitration. \nThey sent someone out without setting an appointment with me and when they showed up I was on my way to work and couldn't stay. \nThey never called me or notified me of the results of their inspection. Sunpower called me two weeks ago to follow up that everything was complete. I told them I had no idea since no one has contacted me. I still have heard nothing. \nRUN! Don't walk away from this company. It is run either by the Three Stooges or the Keystone Kops. I haven't figured out which yet."
0,"I do a bunch of shipping with my business.  We ship around 30 packages a day using FedEx and another 10-20 packages a day using various other carriers.  For about 2 years we used Ontrac but could no longer tolerate the lack of customer service, so we stopped using them.  I would email my representative and he would never get back to me.  We would track packages that say \""Delivered\"" only to be told by our customer that they never received the package.  Then we would go \""round and round\"" trying to get a claim filed.  I cannot say enough bad things about this company and it's lack of customer service and customer care."
1,Finally found a great breakfast place close to home. Great service too! Real corn beef and hash and banana nut French toast....yummo.
1,"Absolutely delish! This is a quick, easy, flavorful, and easy on the wallet lunch spot. Their food is always very tasty and consistent. I've ordered a variety  of their dishes and all of them always beyond expectations.\n\nIf you like super spicy salsa.. You have to ask them for it. I can only drop a couple drops if it because it's like fire.. But good."
1,"My fiance and I were craving a steak and had Poynted a steak place on my smart phone.  This place came up 4-5 stars so we decided to try it out.  When we first walked in it took a good 5 minutes to get greeted...but as soon as our \""soon to be busser\"" saw we were waiting, he came up to us...greeted us, and seated us right away.  We had automatically realized that the restaurant was short staffed...we work in the hospitality industry...so for that fact, we were very understanding. The appetizer, the blackened tuna, served rare, was delicious..and the price was shockingly reasonable for a 6 oz. piece of tuna.   After that we had a 10oz. filet, split, that was ordered med rare.  It had come out rare to our disappointment and we had asked to put it back on the grill for another minute or two to get it up to med rare....but we were also thinking that the rest of our meal would be cold by the time we called the server, sent it back, and have it come out again.  To our surprise, the server, AND the busser were completely nice, quick, and understanding.... they fixed the problem right away.  We got our steak back to perfect temperature, with new sides that we ordered fresh and hot.  Even the house red wine, was good..considering it was house wine.  I think it might have has something to do with the fact that they weren't cheap when ordering wine glasses because they were hand made and had no lip on the rim like a machine would do...I know.....  too analytical.   But it is what it is.  Overall, good quality steak, friendly service, with an amazingly reasonable price.  Would go there again with no questions asked.  mmmmmm....steak."
1,"Quite honestly, the reason that I am a fan is that they have a lot of pool tables, they offer free pool on certain nights, and the bartenders, male or female, are always awesome. PLUS, I get this humongous beer for 2.50 during happy hour with my PT card. Or free if playing 5 quarters. Can one really beat this? Okay, maybe, but I still love this location of the PTs. The food is okay, but what do you expect? It's a bar."
0,Popped in for a minute on a Wed night. It was busy. But as all the gay bars in this neighborhood I unfortunately reside in as a straight woman. It's a total mens club not a dance club. So I did not stay. I was in need of some fun upbeat music and it wasn't happening there.\n\nSeems all bars in the neighborhood are gay or dull but usually both.
1,"A delightfully-refined restaurant.  Sirio is a very upscale Italian restaurant.  It is expensive, but not overpriced.\n\nI had been successful at the tables shortly before, so I treated my parents and brothers to a dinner here.\n\nThe waitstaff has spectacular service and their wine specialist is, to date, one of the most informed wine specialists I've ever had.\n\nI had the filet served medium rare and it was delicious.  The waiter hesitated when taking orders from others who wanted their filets medium.  Solid.\n\nAppetizers were the Calzone Porcini E Rughetta and Gnocch i Al Pesto Genovese, Gamberi E Fagiolini.  There weren't huge, but VERY flavorful.\n\nFor an upscale restaurant in Vegas, this one is a solid bet.  It's pricey, but classy."
0,"To sum up our dining adventure, my husband's comment as we left was \""Well, that was a totally forgettable experience\"".    I had a glass of wine, and wanted another glass to go with the actual meal........the waitress never returned.   Even though I had an empty wine  and water glass and my husband's ice tea was empty.   Overall, the food was fine, but at the prices charged, one should not have to be looking around, hoping to spot their waitress in order to get a beverage refill.    \n\nI ordered the bleu cheese filet and it was delicious.   My husband ordered the Delmonico steak, cooked medium well.   It was definitely done WELL, no pink in sight.   He ate it anyway, since no one checked on how it was and he was hungry.\n\nWould go elsewhere next time."
0,"If you're looking for a lot of food for the money this place is great as the portions are huge.  But unless you like the fried frozen variety of seafood you won't be satisfied.  The non-fried stuff I've ordered has been pretty blah.  Parking is a nightmare during prime times, as are the wait-times for a table, so go in off-hours for sure."
0,"Great for kids, not suitable for adults."
1,I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. I've been going to Naked Fish since they opened. In the last year I've frequented it several times a week. The addiction is real. \n\nThe service is always outstanding. Everyone is so attentive and caring. The fish is ALWAYS fresh and the chefs skilled. No dull moments at the sushi bar especially with the funniest sushi chefs in town. Naked fish is almost like family at this point.
1,"Mise \u00e0 part leurs charcuteries all\u00e9chante, j'aime bien magasiner chez eux des produits import\u00e9s. Beaucoup de ce qu'ils vendent est pas cher et bon. Il n'y a pas \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de produits frais et sant\u00e9, mais pour des p\u00e2tisseries comme ma grand-m\u00e8re slov\u00e8ne les faisait... \u00e7a vaut certainement une petite pause!"
1,"First club I ever went to in Vegas and I'm not sure if anything will top it! The four of us (3 girls and 1 guy) had all flown into Vegas on Saturday and decided that we wanted to hit up the clubs. Coming from Texas, Vermont, and California none of us had any idea what we were getting ourselves into but I cannot say how happy we were with the experience.\n\nWe arrived at TAO around 10 and immediately were overwhelmed. We weren't sure where to go or what to do. Luckily, one of guys with guest relations noticed our confusion and helped us out. Justin took the time to explain everything and answer our questions. (I'd been to the Venetian once before but I was 19 so it was a completely different experience.). For a Vegas newbie this was a godsend!\n\nOnce inside you walk through the bistro portion (the food looked and smelled fantastic) and then up the stairs to the club. The decor is very interesting and I'll admit to wandering around just to see it.  There was an open bar for an hour or so with very responsive bartenders.  I was more than happy to tip them with how fast I was getting my drink.\n\nThe layout of the nightclub includes multiple bars, two DJs, and a small patio. Our group hopped back and forth between the different dance floors (yes, they did get crowded but who wants to dance on an empty floor).  Also, unlike some of the other reviews I read we had no problem finding guys to talk to.  After a lot of drinking, dancing, and making new friends we decided to head back to our hotel.  As we left they had some free flip flops which were exactly what our feet needed after 5+ hours in high heels.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back again to TAO and recommend it to my friends when they head to Vegas. Hopefully the next time we come we'll be able to spring for bottle service"
0,Food is good. Customer service sucks!!
0,"Wow... The owner has real guts to call his restaurant as \""Indian restaurant\""... It taste nowhere close to food... Every thing is frozen... Do not recommend..."
0,"Wow.. Where do I start...\n\nOk so I use this app ALL the time, and it has never once let me down, UNTIL NOW. Im born and raised from NY, needless to say, barbershops up there don't survive unless they give quality haircuts, there's just too much competition. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my hair. I lived in Raleigh for about 5 years before moving to charlotte, and I managed to find an amazing barber who cut hair better than anyone i had been to even in NY. Well now im in charlotte and in desperate need of a haircut so I search on yelp and choose this shop. \n\nLet me start off by saying I dont know if i got the wrong barber or what the case was but i dont know what the other people were thinking giving this place 5 stars. It gets one star for these reasons.\n\n1- 18 dollar haircut for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. I got a 20 minute half*** cut, a \""hot towel shave\"" on the back of my neck only.... WHAT? REALLY? Dont get me wrong, im not cheap ive spent upwards of $30 on a cut when its warranted but this was just a joke. I had hair on my face, not once was it brushed off. When I was shown my haircut I expressed little emotion to see if the barber would notice that I wasn't pleased, nope, just prepped me for my \""hot towel shave\"". Even upon leaving I just got a measly, \""Thanks\"" and they knew I was a first time customer because I told them. Just terrible service. It was dead in there too when i went.\n\n2. I looked at the guy getting a haircut next to me. He was almost done, I looked at his hair, and my grandmother could have done a better job. Upon being asked \""what do you think?\"" The guy cringed with that sense of, \""Eh, I hate it\"", and proceeded to say \""Its fine\"". Barber didnt even bat an eyelash and prepped him for his \""hot towel shave\"".\n\n3.Overall the experience was awful, and I hate having to down a business, but I will never go back there, I would rather drive 2.5 hours back to Raleigh to get a quality haircut, where the barber makes sure you dont leave looking anything short of top notch, you get a real hot towel shave, and you walk out feeling like a million bucks not like ****. Also for the record, my main barber charges $20 per cut plus tip too. Price is not a big deal as long as it is worth it, and this place was not worth it.\n\nIf you have the stones to give this shop a shot, hopefully for the sake of the business i was one of very few customers that had that bad of an experience. Just giving you fellow yelpers my opinion."
1,I love this place! Thursdays offer FREE beer tastings! Be sure to stop by  \n\nFood truck Fridays are off the hook too.
1,"Sensational Food, Spellbinding View\n\nThe Fountains Brunch at Jasmine may be the best Sunday brunch you've never heard of. In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. \n\nOutside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \n\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \n\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \n\nOverall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations, go hungry, and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else, this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip."
1,"The food is great, and the staff are so nice and friendly. I will definitely be back."
0,"I just left nektar, there were 6 people working, 3 customers in the store. It took 23 minutes to get 2 juices. The service there is really hit or miss, the last few times it has been a major miss. There is very little customer service. The product is still very good but the service is going to make me start going elsewhere. Juice bars are starting to get very competitive, nektar might start to struggle if their service doesn't improve."
1,"A delightful place to spend an afternoon doing homework while a bunch of middle aged folks play the fiddle, electric violin and accordion that is blissfully free of hipsters."
1,I've been dealing with Peter for several years and I've had very good luck with selection and quality. On occasion there has been a high humidity issue but its rare and I usually order cigars by the box anyway so the mould indicated in other reviews is not normally apparent to me. \nThere have also been a few staffing problems so the consistency of service isn't at a high level yet. I'm sure Peter is aware of the situation and improvements are being made. There is no reason to avoid the humidor. Browse and enjoy!
0,"We were dragged here with a friend because she was craving seafood.  Unfortunately, the only thing that was better than average was the oyster crackers and the ice water.  The incredibly \""fishy\"" smell punches you in the nose when you walk in, and the crowd is almost exclusively retired.  There's nothing wrong with that - other than people tend to lose their taste buds as they age - that's the only reason I can explain how busy they were.  They're \""famous\"" for their fish & chips.  The cod was no bueno and the fries were soggy.  I'm sorry, but if that's what you're famous for, you better bring it every time!  The service was less than desirable, and it's safe to say I'll NEVER go back."
1,We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.
1,"We've been coming to this place for 3 years - each year we hold our breath that it will be as good as last year.  So far, so good.   Nothing elaborate, just good basic comfort food with a friendly staff and"
0,"Worst Poutine i've had  in a long time.  If you are a poutine noob, don't go there.  1st, it is a tourist trap.  2nd, they are using the wrong kind of cheese.  Go to La Banquise.  Do yourself a favor"
1,"My boyfriend and I came here for one of my 21st birthday dinners (we were in Vegas celebrating).\n\nWhen we first entered, there were naked girls with painted flower petals on their boobies sitting in separate bathtubs full of rose petals near the entrance. That was an interesting start! We sat in the lounge and waited for the hostess to take us to our table. It was VERY crowded and noisy with attractive people everywhere. \n\nWe walked past the GIANT buddah near the wall and were seated at one of the many tables. I don't remember most of what we had for dinner by now, but it was cutely presented. I remember some pretty good sushi, seafood, and steak...\n\nMy favorite is the also GIANT fortune cookie filled with chocolate and vanilla mousse topped with tons of tropical fruits."
1,Went here on my last Vegas trip. I had The Miyagi-san burger which was very delicious. Also tried the Truffle Parmesan Fries they were soooo good. Definitely coming back to this place on my next Vegas trip.
0,"I have been here a few times, but each time there is less and less meat and the price stays around $10. The people working are generally rude. I gave it two stars only because they could actually make a decent sandwich if they used a little more meat. The quality is actually pretty good (boars head) and tasty. I grew up in NJ, so I've been to Philly and had the real deal. If you're in East Gilbert and need a quick fix, be prepared to pay the price, otherwise, head out to Forefathers, Philly's Famous or Corleone's for a heartier sandwich for the same price."
1,Delux has been a great spot for years and many burger joints have tried to copy this concept and they are good but there is one delux.  The french fry's on a cart of pretty bananas and the sweet potato style cart is just as great if not better.  I give these guys major kudos for their selection of menu items and they have great options for beer drinkers as well.  The price is reasonable for their experience.
0,"Made reservations there for my wife's birthday. I live in the Plaza Lofts in Kierland, so this was walking distance, just 3 minutes away. We arrived on time and were promptly brought to our table which was stuffed in the back corner by a waiters station. The issue with this is the restaurant was half empty, so we passed  several tables that were preferable. (the empty tables stayed empty for at least an hour.\n\nMy wife had the twin lobster tails which were rubbery with no flavor. We ordered the yellow tail sashimi which smelled and tasted \""fishy\"". They claim to offer a Gluten Free menu but they did not have gluten free soy sauce!!!???? My steak was good but nothing memorable...just a meal.\n\nOf course, the fellow in the suit came by to ask how everything was. I told him about the poor seating and he shot back, \""we should have asked for something else\"". I don't know why I'm forced to debate  an 18 year old girl with too much make-up and an attitude about my seat.  For some reason they feel its smarter to shove me in a crappy seat (regardless my reservation) and leave better seating EMPTY.\n\nMY wife used to bring corporate clients to OC....because it's close to her office in Kierland.....used to!"
1,"When I decided to buy a scooter, I had no idea what to look for. I visited AZ Scooter on Cave Creek Rd. saw all the choices and still felt overwhelmed! Right away, the owner of the store, Kurt Budday, came over, asked what he could do to help and was extremely helpful! He explained the difference and options of engine size, legal requirements (yes, you do need a motorcycle endorsement!), advised taking a scooter riding course and Chinese scooters vs all the other brands (and warranties). \n\nNo pressure, just helpful guidance and a commitment to service.\n\nThought I should do some comparative shopping and visited a scooter shop in Scottsdale the following weekend. Lots of bikes, just me in the showroom. When a salesperson finally came inside to see what I wanted, I explained that I was a first-time buyer and wanted a scooter for quick trips around the neighborhood. He suggested I visit their website, make choice and let him know. I asked about prices, makes and models, he asked, \""Have you looked at our website? It depends on what you choose.\""\n\nWell okay!\n\nMore than ever, I knew that AZ Scooter was the place for me. It's a busy shop on Saturdays, but customers are made to feel like there's all the time in the world to help them with their needs. When I made my purchase, I was confident that I'd made the absolute right choice! \n\nBefore taking possession of my scooter, we went over the machine and all my questions were answered. And as I headed out of the parking lot, I thought, \""Wow! What a neat group of people and what a find!\"" \n\nIf you're thinking about purchasing a scooter, look no more! AZ Scooter on Cave Creek Road is the place to go!"
0,"Was surprised how many Hawaiian natives are praising this place. The mixed plate and Poke were both drowned in sauce to the point that the meal was ruined. It didn't taste like anything I've had in Hawaii, but was fascinated by this strange hotel named after California and filled with Hawaiians. There's a book on the hotel's history and its connection to Hawaii. I also went to try the Shave Ice at the ice cream shop next door, but the machine was broken. What a bust!"
1,"All you need is LOVE!  I've been waiting to see this show since it came out.  It's always been too expensive so when we saw a deal online, we jumped on it!  The show was amazing!  They sell big drinks for $15.  I kept the cup!  I love the music...I love the beatles!"
0,"My Las Vegas VIP is a scam! I purchased a Groupon that included a pool party, lounge w/ drink specials, and club to use this weekend. Their procedure was to submit a registration form with Groupon #s on their website no more than 24 hours in advance of using it. I did on Friday but didn't receive a call like they said they would. They didn't return my calls into Friday night and started texting me in broken English. What kind of business runs by text? They said I could go to Pure (which I later found out was free for guys that Friday) that night, but my reservation was for Saturday when my entire party would be available. They said they would send info for our pool party, lounge and club later on Friday night. They didn't return my calls or texts until 2:30 a.m.! \n\nThey gave us the Hard Rock Rehab pool party. However, we found out when we arrived that Hard Rock was also free because Rehab doesn't start until next weekend. It wasn't a pool party, no DJ, nothing. We just showed our IDs and got in. There was no My Las Vegas VIP host to greet us and take us in like the Groupon said. Strike two! I called them and someone finally picked up for the first time. I complained and they said it's normally $40 but couldn't offer anything else. They said they would get back to me on the lounge and club for that night. THEY NEVER DID. Strike three! \n\nI didn't try to contact them again because I was fed up and they were the ones who were supposed to set up the reservation and contact us. I wasn't about to go to another free place. They stole $189 from me and I contacted Groupon for a refund. I hope Groupon ends their relationship with this scam. This so-called company is probably just a group of club promoters that prey on the uninformed and run their business on their cell phone."
0,"I brought a full grain Schlesinger leather briefcase (current cost for a new one is $450) here to get the handle fixed. Fred suggested replacing the handle and I agreed because it was torn. The briefcase is about 14 years old and is showing wear so I asked Fred if he could clean it up. He said he could re-dye it and it would look good. So I said ok. \nHere is my conclusion on the quality of the work: both handles got replaced. The old handles were of much higher quality and had a metal tube inside of the handles for stability. The replacements were skinnier and cheaper with no inside support--basically more of leather straps as compared to handles. \n\nWhen I went to pick up the bag, the dye job was horrible, so they kept the case to redo it. They dyed it much darker than the original color--very disappointing! They took a full grain leather case and made it look cheap. Plus, the work was sloppy. There was dye on the buttons and hooks, which I cleaned off. It looked as if they spray painted it without masking some of the metal parts.  I paid $70 and I'd say it was worth maybe $35. I'm really sorry I had them dye it. I could have done a better job myself with some shoe polish and leather cleaner.  Now it looks like a different briefcase, and the case looks cheap--too late!\n\nMy advice is to be very clear with B&L as to exactly what you want and expect. Also, I found Fred to be kind of rude and not very pleasant. I will likely not be using B&L in the future."
0,"I've been to a few Cirque Du Soleil shows, and this is probably my least favorite. We chose Ka because it was infused with martial arts. While that is true, they could have done so much more with it and included more martial arts The story dragged on way too long, and there wasn't enough action going on. My bf and I actually fell asleep on some parts of it.There wasn't a lot of the typical Cirque tricks either...come to think of it, there weren't a lot of tricks period. The highlight for us was when they were doing the planko trick. It was when they had the stage tilted and the performers were human plankos.  I think I had a better time before the show started when some of the performers were going around talking to us and making fun of some of the people in the audience. I don't recommend this one, go see another Cirque Du Soleil show."
1,Mocha double frozen hot chocolate rocked my daughters world
1,"Driven by this place a bunch of times and got there just after the lunch rush near 2pm. Strange menu for a Greek place that included cheesesteaks and hot dogs. I stuck with the pita selection and chose the chicken breast. Pretty standard stuff, chicken breast, tomatoes, lettuce on a good wrap style pita. Got the combo which included a greek salad that was loaded with feta and tasty dressing and drink. The tzitiki sauce here is also really good. Only $7.95 or 2 bucks less without salad. Healthy option and drive through also available."
0,"I was in the mood to try Tepanyaki and Ah-So is much closer to me than Benihana's.  But I was not happy with the food.  It was not as tasty.  The fried rice was pretty bland.  The soup they bring you and the salad were pretty tasty and the shrimp we got was worth it.  I don't think I will go back though b/c it just wasn't the same as Benihana.  For as pricey as it was, it just wasn't what I hoped for tastewise.  Meh."
0,"The room was expensive, especially considering the summer rates.  The waterpark experience was disappointing. We couldn't bring in juice for our kids. Only water bottles.  When my wife and I decided to get a cocktail it was $20 for two and there was no trace of any alcohol. I asked the bartender if I got a non alcoholic drink by mistake.  It's all regulated so you get 1 oz in a tall drink.  For $10 a drink I felt taken advantage.  The closing time on Saturday is 4pm. They tell you that you have full access to the waterpark on check in day but check in time is 4pm. How does that work?  For the cost of the room and drink service we should have stayed at a 5 star resort.  We have stayed here before and had a better experience. This will be the last time for this resort.  The Hilton Squaw Peak is a much better option."
1,Delicious and reasonable.  A hidden treasure.
0,"Wouldn't go back. It's a cool spot and all but it was too expensive for a dive bar. Maybe it was for the show but it felt overpriced for what the spot really is. Bartender was nice, got carded twice since they don't have security checking who comes into the place."
0,"Made an appt for the Genius Bar and still waited 30 minutes to be seen. The guy I dealt with was nice enough but didn't listen to my concerns and I left without the problem being fixed. Went to the arrowhead store and Sean listened to me and had my problem fixed ASAP. It was actually a bad charger, which is what I thought but the first guy refused to test it and told me there was no way that could be the problem. Won't be back to this location."
1,"Tried them this weekend and i was rather impressed. The burgers were good, and i would definitely try getting something other than a single. Fries were tasty, and well salted.  Personally i prefer thicker fries, but at the moment the shoe string fries did the trick.The dining area was nice and clean. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and their menu was pretty easy to get thru. \n\nMy wife had the custard and she said that it was great! One gripe is that they do not offer a No Sugar Added alternative.\n\nI would definitely go back!"
1,"Stopped for a quick lunch and what can you say. A couple of classic Nathan's hot dogs that go snap when you bite them, fries, and a soda are hard to beat for a fast food meal. Especially for a hot dog lover like me."
1,Fantastic gelato!  Locally sourced ingredients and a staff/ownership that truly cares for their product. Move aside froyo!
1,"Started the evening with a moonshine flight of strawberry, blueberry and the apple pie. Blueberry was decent strawberry was better but the in house made apple pie was the star of the three. It was sweet with just the right amount of burn on the way down. \n\nWe moved on to the Bacon board it was amazing. I really enjoyed the jalape\u00f1o and applewood bacon. My wife enjoyed the con fit and we both felt the pork belly was the best thing in the board. The sweet onion spread was excellent as well as the house made pickles. \n\nWe then shared the BBQ sampler each of the meats on the sampler were very good but the pulled pork was the shining star by far. The BBQ sauce was thick and sweet. \n\nAs it was our 22nd anniversary they gave us a sample of the chocolate cake and the cherry pie milkshake. Both are awesome. \n\nThe waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly. Bootleggers will definitely become a staple for our dining dollars."
1,"We tried shaved ice also for the first time. If don't have a sweet tooth baby size is way to go. Small size is kinda big for my wife and I. They have so much flavor flavor to choose from. It was pretty good shaved ice though. \nI'm only giving it 4 star because the customer service is good but not that great. \n\nMy wife noticed that the lady was kinda sarcastic in some way. It was our first, we were expecting to have explanation what's on that particular flavor or what not. \n\nYeah maybe we'll come back again."
0,"First off, anyone who knows me would be SHOCKED that I would go to a chain let alone this place but I got a gift card for Christmas so I thought I would go use it up last night. So I go in and it all started off ok. Bartender seemed nice enough. Bourbon selection was what you could expect from a place like this so I got myself a Maker's on the rocks and perused the menu. Since I wasn't paying I figured I'd order a nice big meal and relax for a bit. When the bartender came over I started ordering but I only got out the appetizer (Edamame) and Salad (Pear Gorgonzola) when she started walking off. I had to get her attention and stop her so I could finish ordering. It was rather odd if you ask me but again, you can't get your hopes up too much in a place like this.\n\nA little while later, and I really thought it took a bit longer than it should, someone comes out with the Edamame AND salad at the same time. It took a second for the person to finally get it when I kept telling them that I didn't want them at the same time. She seemed awfully confused by the fact that I would want to sit and enjoy my edamame and THEN eat my salad. I sent the salad back with a bad feeling it would just sit in the window, which is what it did because it took the bartender seconds to go back to get it and bring it out. Quite obvious that they just set it back in the kitchen.\n\nWhen I finally ate my salad it was nothing special. I don't know why but it was insanely boring even though it sounded like it should be good. I'm not even that picky of an eater, but only finished it so that I wouldn't get my entree spit in and I was hungry so I didn't feel like waiting forever.\n\nI order a Ribeye for dinner as I was starving for protein and iron. I couldn't believe, once again, how flipping boring this steak was. Luckily I still had soy sauce close by so I poured some on to get a little flavor. Even the  mashed potatoes were lack luster. They tried to be \""fancy\"" a put a ridiculous rosemary sprig in it, but it just didn't save the bland food. \n\nAfter only two drinks they RAN OUT of Maker's Mark. I REALLY couldn't believe they had no back up. I just can't imagine the people who hang out at this bar are drinking up Makers so that tells me they don't stock well. I wound up drinking Jack since the only other \""high end\"" bourbon they had was Woodford, which I don't really think is a decent whiskey to drink straight. \n\nAll in all it was an experience that just backs up my distaste for these chain restaurants. Boring food, mediocre service, and mind numbing atmosphere. I don't get why these places are successful but then again, I don't McDonald's or Taco Bell and they are successful too. \n\nIf you are in the District go to Balboa Pizza or King's Fish House. Save your money and your taste buds from this place."

0,"Ahh gaaaahh. Third time here. Two times more than I should have. Food is typically average. Only come because my parents are intrigued by their $8.50 lunch box... But this third time was just uuggghh. I try to be an understanding customer and not lash out at waitresses because usually if the food is crap, it's not their fault but I gave these two waitresses my first lashing because they let me sit there and boil for twenty minutes as I waited for them. \n\nThe experience (setting: there were only 5 other occupied tables and no one came in after us):\n1) it was15 minutes after we were seated before we got water. We had to ask for it. Our glasses were never refilled.. Esp since they didn't come by until I called for them.\n2) there were 4 of us. we had to ask for another utensil setting since table only had 3. \n3) food took 10 minutes to partially come out. We had to ask for our miso soup since they forgot or didn't know our lunch came with it. Waitress told us that our two cali rolls would take a little bit. Those did not come out til 30 min later. \n4) food was beyond poor. My teriyaki salmon didn't have a teriyaki glaze. Seemed like it was just deep fried. Hard - overcooked. My dads teriyaki salmon was   still raw in the inside. My moms bulgogi was flavorless and cold and galbi was hard and not marinated. My bfs tofu soup (soondubu) tasted Ok but not traditional flavor or what I'm used to. Wasn't even red. Daeji bulgogi was Ok. Lastly, the Cali roll was ugh. The rice around the roll just didn't taste right. The insides were standard.\n\nI asked if there was a new chef or something and she just responded, we are a bit unorganized today. My parents have been here more than me and said this time was the worst, too, and  we've never had the same waitress... Sooo.. Yeah.\n\nDone with this place."

1,Love that I can ride a bike (or walk or rollerblade or whatever) from my hotel on McCormick Parkway all the way down to breakfast in Old Town. Last year I failed to look around and rode a cruiser all the way down Scottsdale road. Ding dong. Not smart.  Soooo much happier this year. Plus - around there were dudes with their full-scale model power boats on the lake and that was very cool to watch.
0,I went to this place knowing that it was fast food mexican.  The food was just ok and I've tried it a few times. The people that work there are never nice and have never said Hi or thank you. I'm obviously not going there for the atmosphere but c'mon you could have some manners. \nThe last time I ate here the girl started mopping under my table that I was eating at and all of the others beside me. The smell of the floor cleaner was so overwhelming it got me sick. I did tell her not to mop near me but should I have to? I won't be eating here again. Even if the food was good it's not worth the attitude this place gives.
0,"We decided to try this place since its close by. I categorized this place as my 'will try once\"" food place. I really want to like it because of their selection. Sadly i am not returning as a customer. \n\n- long wait, disorganized\n- food was blah, only good food was texas toast! \n- not a lot of seafood selection"
1,"Truffle fries were excellent.  You can pass on the duck and pork belly buns.  The iced tea was terrible, boba was not good.  Miagi burger was really good.  Cooked perfectly, juicy and tangy.  It was a little oily though but still good."

1,"I went to an after party last night and I thought the place was pretty.  I am not into the club scene and far more into networking, and getting to know people. You could have a conversation there, the bartender poured very generously, the seating was cool and comfortable and the deck view was incredible. They did need to wash that window that lets you see 50 stories down."
0,Just had an asain casket treat us rudely .   Why we did nothing wrong.\n\nAll we did was ask him about different shots and what was better he asked if we were intoxicated and wouldn't sell them to us
1,"This place is to die for.  Everyone I bring here either finish their entire huge bowl of noodles or in my husband's case, eat my bowl as well.  Their choice of broths are all flavorful with varying degrees of heaviness/lightness.  The pork is to die for.  The non noodle dishes look great as well but I can't tear myself away from the noodles. Since it's cold out right now, nothing hits the spot more than a bowl of hot flavorful noodles.  Be sure to get there early, before 11:30 if you're going there for lunch because there's always a line out the door."

0,"Okay I've had it up to here with this location. I've written letters before because they have been out of guacamole, chips, and crispy tacos numerous times. They always seem to be running low on something. This time in particular I went to fulfill my Chipotle craving and the girl preparing the food tells me they're out of chicken o_O I asked her if I could wait and she said no because none of the Chipotle locations in Las Vegas have chicken... Excuse me? Look. I need them to get it together because this is ridiculous. On top not having chicken at any location in town, this chick was rude about it. I'm sure she was annoyed because everyone had been complaining about the chicken all day, but there should've been a sign in front to give us a heads up before we all waited in line for the news. I settled for steak tacos but it was not the same. Guess I'll be taking my money to Baja Fresh.\n\nThis is all I got for Yelp but I bet they will be hearing from me."
0,"When we dine in at Bliss, the waiters are attentive and knowledgable; when we order food for take-out, our food is ..overpriced and *always* incorrect. The last two times we've ordered in, there's been an issue with the fries. 1st, we received a giant clamshell of rock solid fries so requested some edible fries to replace the disgusting bone-dry ones.  Now, we order fries for $2 dollars and without prior warning, we get half the size usual for a to-go portion. WHAT GIVES!? For $2, we can get two giant fries from McDonald's that will at least be semi-appetizing. Get it together, Bliss, cause you're more like a Bust. Save your thirty bucks for Circle K."
0,I gave this place a chance. Numerous times...but I now feel 100% confident in saying I will NEVER walk into this location ever again. The clothes are cheap and worth the one or two wears...but I refuse to look or speak to any of those RUDE employees. It's like you ruin their day asking for something. HR did a great job hiring the worst group of people ever. Have I mentioned that awful high pitched alarm that is constantly going off at the register?? I'll take my 20 bucks to one at Fashion Square.
0,"The real truth about \""hotel upgrades\"". I booked a 4 night stay at the Bellagio for myself and my husband from Nov 23-27 for a little R&R as he had surgery coming up. We have been to Vegas several times, but not that hotel. What a disappointment. I booked and paid for a \""Premier Fountain view\"" room and put a deposit on it. We arrived around 9 pm after our flight and I went to check in.  I was looking forward to this.  Our desk clerk looked up the reservation and said \"" We have to move you to a different room\"".  This room is not available. I told her I reserved it online, and put a deposit on it.  She said if I read the fine print on the web site, it is NOT guaranteed.  WHAT??? In a nutshell what this and I am sure other hotels do is advertise a special and when you book it, and arrive late ( her words) they gave the room to someone that would pay the full rate!! I was so bloody pissed off. She said it was because I asked for 2 queen beds.  I told her I would take the King bed as originally booked, and she looked at me and said\"" no, we don't have it\"" They told us they were \""upgrading the room\"" to a Junior Suite, but at the far end of the hotel, and with a partial fountain view. This was NOT an upgrade!!  This is what they tell everyone who's room they give to someone else. I just read a review on Trip Advisor where the customer \""tipped\"" the hotel clerk $100 and not only got a suite, but free buffet and other tickets. If I had known that I would have done the same, however I thought bribery was not legal????? The best the hotel did for us, was reimburse the ridiculous $28 a day \""resort fee\"".\nSo folks the next time the hotel tells you they are \""upgrading you\"", I would say in most cases unless you slip them a huge \""tip\"" they probably gave your room away to someone who would pay a higher price. \nI had friends that stayed in the Paris across the road that had a better view for 1/2 the price.  I will NOT be going back to this hotel, or ANY hotel MGM operates."

1,"Really glad to finally have a place to eat congee and dim sum near UW! Happy valley is a congee and bar (interesting combination) that has recently opened at Lester and University. Being the big congee fan that I am, I just had to try it once they've opened.\n\nTheir congee come in large portions at a reasonable price, around $6 per bowl, they come in the usual congee flavours but my personal favourite is the preserved egg and pork congee, its a classic. Each bowl of congee come with thinly sliced ginger and lettuce on the bottom and topped off with some green onions and deep-fried flour(or dough?) pieces on top. SOMETIMES a little tray of peanuts comes as a side but they forget to serve it most of the time. \n\nOne other I usually order is the dim sum such as shrimp dumplings (), chicken feet (), tripe and pork and bamboo shoot wrapped in bean curd. Their dim sum is on the pricier end, at $3.49 per order (not so large) I can only order limited amounts if I want to keep a budget of under $20.\n\nI've heard from other people that their normal Chinese dishes like Portuguese chicken, black pepper chicken etc. is mediocre, so I generally stick with the congee and dim sum when I go! \n\nThe place is quite large and I've never seen it more than 30% filled, however they should really turn up the heating on colder days since I had to eat lunch with my jacket on plenty of times during my visits since it gets very chilly in there."

1,"I went here also when the club was pretty new.. It was actually packed on the Thursday night during June that i went with my girlfriends.  The line was pretty long and we actually got there kinda early like around 10-10:30pm.  We didn't know there was another line for girls so we were standing there for awhile until someone told us.. It's funny how all these boys suddenly start talking to you to see if they can tag along with you and skip the line! \n\nWHAT POWER GIRLS HAVE IN VEGAS!!! MUCHO POWER!\n\nit sucked though. we still payed $20 cover. wtheck?!?! \n\ngoing downstairs had really nice decor.. nice decor on the walls going into the club also.  the place was packed like sardines. SARDINES in a can that hasn't been opened yet.  thank god there was an outside patio with the waterfall.. helping to coool us off..\n\nthe WATERFALL is probably the highlight of the club i must say.  It made the view and the looks of the club more unique.  Throughout the night, the music was good from what I remember.. my friends and I were too occupied with getting free drinks though...OOOPS.. it was our first night in vegas.. and my first night in vegas EVER.... free drinks :) \n\nwe stayed until closing.. that was insane!! I'm planning to go back there in 2 weeks!! tryst is on our list!"
1,"This is a friendly, tasty, fried fast food joint. Fried but not greasy!!  I'm here with a group and the outside/inside choice is perfect. Everyone, even veggie lovers are happy!! The pernil empa is crispy but not greasy, with a delicious meatball of juicy pork. Also loved the plantains, rice and black beans! And the sweet empas were good too.  Dinner for $11! A real find"
1,"Sushi Fever is my favorite mid-priced Sushi joint in Vegas.  The fish is always fresh, and they have a wide range of creative, signature rolls.  My personal favorites are the Mexican roll and the Dale Earnhardt roll.  Not quite sure why they equated Dale Earnhardt with soft shell crab, but it works.  \n\nIt's a bit pricier than other sushi places around town, but it's less than what you'll find on the strip or in off-strip casinos, and the freshness and creativity are worth a few extra bucks."
0,"The food sorta tasted okay, but it was made from horrible crappy ingredients. I couldn't finish because the cheese they used made me nauseous after a few bites. I just couldn't chew it anymore while thinking about what it was going to do to my insides. I felt like if I stuck some on my arm, it would be absorbed by my skin and instantly turned into fat and an artery clog. \n\nLet me back up though - the parking lot is a crowded mess where you can pretty much assume your car is going to get dented by another car door. How about some wider spaces and one person has to park on the street? After that, you walk into a dark dungeon where a 9 month pregnant girl directs you through some sort of dark bar into some hideously decorated brighter room with booths stolen from an IHOP that burned down in the 80s. \n\nThe table and seats were filthy and greasy and if someone sits behind you, you share opposite sides of a seatback - which is a little too intimate for me... \n\nThe margaritas are small and not very powerful or particularly tasty or memorable. The food in general was pretty greasy. The chips and salsa were average. The prices were pretty steep considering what you're getting. The service was decent I suppose, but I felt like I was being served by scary grade school lunch ladies. \n\nI won't be going back any time soon. I left more on my plate than I ate... I also left wanting to puke up what I did consume and start lunch over somewhere good. This food would've been appreciated a little more if the cost was about 1/3 of what it was. It still wouldn't have been good though.\n\nThis place seemed pretty authentic to me - it's not like authentic = good... Real Mexican food is shitty - cheap ingredients and too much grease and fat. It's an authentic shitty Mexican food restaurant. Go eat somewhere else."
1,"Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \""what it is.\""  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!\n\nWhile the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure."

0,I do business with these people because I have a cpap machine.  They don't have great nor good phone skills.  I was told that they world deliver all i need today all the items I need. Well 5 hours have gone by no call from them no nothing.\n So I call them made plans to pick up my items that I need. Been in line forever. Did I assume this would be a quick and easy process well I may have been foolish enough to believe such crap. I should expect slow and no service from a company who has had 4 months to deliver items to my home but has not done so. I'm so angry about this I can just spit. And what do u know my order would happen to be incorrect. I have a cpap machine already they have me down for a cpap. I'm so angry at this moment this has been a 4 month total process in all this time they don't have things correct yet...One thing I need is a mask but do they have me down for that no.
1,"Bought a groupon for 2 hot stone therapy massages w/ aromatherapy.  So far I have only used one.  I went and the therapist used a very intense deep tissue technique that was a little painful but effective.  My neck felt a lot better, although at times during the massage I wanted to cry.  I drank lots of water and took it easy for a few days and did notice a huge difference, so although it wasn't what I expected, I agree that it worked!  I noticed a decrease in headaches and irritability as well.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little weird.  It is in an older office park and there were employees from other businesses smoking outside, which is not what you want to experience when you leave your session.  It was a little hard to find, and even with a good idea of where I was going, I had to make a U-turn to get into this office park.  The office seemed small and ideal for a really small company, not a spa-like atmosphere.  I think a change of location would do them a world of good and make me feel more comfortable about going back.  Also the receptionist was talking about playing Facebook games and it was a little awkward...it seemed like it was kind of a shady operation at first.  I felt like her attitude and the office environment detracted from the professionalism of my massage therapist."
0,"First time here and went in for a staight manicure ($15). The front desk and ambience are great. Tammy, who took care of me, was not friendly nor a good listener. She asked if I wanted square tip, I said round. She filed my first hand square.  I asked if she could please file them round, so she had to cut my nails even shorter. When it came to painting my nails, she left me under the ultraviolet light to do someone else's pedicure. A little unsure, I sat there too long until the gal next to me asked, \""how long did she tell you to sit here?\"" Her nail gal said I should be done. After leaving and look at my nails in the sunlight, I have all kinds of streaks and polish on my hands.

1,"when you combine many many many bottles of soju, vodka and friends, you are bound to wake up the next morning with a wicked hangover. a definite sign that you are no longer in your 20s. the cure? even if it's 100+ degrees out, for me it'll always be a piping hot bowl of soup with noodles. \n\nwhat i ate:\n- cold app plate: seaweed, pig ears, cucumbers: you pick three! just go up to the cold table display. i cant tell you what else they offered because i was too tired to move from the table. everything was good! super garlicky with a nice big of heat in the end, true to the szechwan style\n- house special noodle soup (i think #2 on menu?): if youre too eager to drink the soup, you WILL burn yourself! it's THAT hot. the broth is clear, and delicate in flavor. not too heavy or spicy to make your already hungover stomach hurt. i think my friends and i spent the entire meal with our faces getting a nice steam bath from our soups and not talking at all. we kept slurping hoping it would melt away our hangover.\n\npros:\n- house special noodle soup! hot enough to get a sweat going, but the cure for my hangover. \n- service: for an asian restaurant they were pretty nice\n- mom n pop feel\n- almost all the patrons were asian - always a good sign\n- price: cheap!\n\ncons:\n- if youre not a fan of spicy food, this place isnt for you\n\nwould i come again? yes, even without being hungover."

0,"I can't say that I had a great experience.  \n\nI was having a particularly weird issue where my AC wouldn't turn off after reaching the set point, but this issue would come and go (usually with rain).  I was suspecting something electrical was bad, but not sure what.\n\nI called and response time was good.  He checked everything and said it all looked fine, and that it must be my thermostat.  He offered to replace it for me, and I declined.\n\nI replaced the thermostat but the issue came back after the next rain.  I ended up getting a separate issue with my other unit, and I decided to call back to have him look at both units.  He said he was really backed up and wouldn't be able to make it in a couple of days, so I called someone else (search my reviews and you'll see who).\n\nThe other HVAC tech found a litany of issues that Flores missed.  Bad caps and contactors, dry rotted fuse box, old fuses, and dry rotted thermostat wires on the roof (most likely cause of my issues after rain).  I'm happy I found someone who took the time to check everything and listen to my description of the issue.  \n\nUnfortunately, this person was not Flores A/C."

1,"I love Taza Flores! The place looks good and the terrace is very pleasant in the summer. The service is very friendly and attentive. And everything on the menu is really really good. I've been going for years and it never fails. My favorite are the lamb tajine, the chorizo, the eggplant pizza and the mergez in tomato sauce. It is a bit expensive for the size of the portions, but they put love into it."
1,"Chicken Latino is easily my favorite place to eat in the Strip and is one of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh. Their fried burritos are crunchy and gooey on the inside and, with a splash of their verde sauce, taste like heaven.\n\nTheir rotisserie chicken is seasoned well and goes well with their black beans and spanish rice.\n\nWhat really steals the show and is my undisputed favorite item on the meny is their carnitas. They're only served on the weekends but they're delicious. Fork tender and with a bit of fat for flavor, put a bit in your fresh tortilla with some rice and beans and a splash of verde for heat. What happens is what I suspect occurs right before you take your first breath; this otherworldly sense of peace.\n\nEveryone working there is great, too. They do a good job waiting tables in what I consider a casual eatery, not a place that you'd expect such good service.\n\nDefinitely try their horchata and tres leches cake, too. Yum.\n\nFor a longer review: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/09/15/in-which-i-describe-my-love-of-green-salsa/"
0,Save yourself money and time by going to the Rio instead. The Rio's about half the price and the line outside moves quicker. This buffet was a massive let down. I'm a local and brought my mom there for birthday. $32 per person is fine when the food is good. Not the case. Servers were great but nothing could save the food :(
0,"Incredibly disappointed with Take Paws. We had a wonderful dog walker initially through them, but when she left for another job our next dog walker had minimal experience being around dogs and was unable to walk our 2 dogs at once.  We are currently looking for another dog walking service."
1,"My girlfriend and I ate here last night for our anniversary dinner and we both enjoyed it very much. We'd been wanting to try it, and we would definitely go back. I had the swordfish with grilled shrimp scampi, and she had the salmon and blue crab cake, and all the food was delicious. The flavors were unique and the fish was actually quite fresh, which is usually a rarity here in Arizona. The portions were a tad on the small side, but luckily we also had bread, drinks, and creme brule for dessert that left us pretty full. I wouldn't call this the best seafood place I've ever eaten at, but it's certainly one of the better ones in the Phoenix metro area."
0,"my husbands and mine  first time in vegas and as far as the hotel Goes, its great. My negative,which is a serious deal\nBreaker for me is when something is not clean-(because i do hair, i  am licensed to touch, meaning i had to learn about ALL infection and sanitation and how to avoid spreading infection etc....) Once i walked in the bathroom i looked at the towels and saw light yellow crusty residue on the towel!!! I know what it is, just didnt want to say (barf) But looking at all the towels i could clearly tell, either the temperature on their dryers are not hot enough to kill bacteria. Or someone's not doing their job washing them with rthe correct temperature water :/ they did fix it after i called them but i was honestly disgusted. The headboard has wierd stains on it- just want to tell the housekeepers to pay extra attention and CLEAN!!!!  not just surface cleaning- but sanitize!! I hope the hotel teaches them about sanitation and disinfection. The tubs, the sheets, everything! It needs it. Our remit control also doesnt work. Womp."
1,"My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome! \nGreat place, we will be back!"
0,"These guys came to my house everyday for 3 months to service my neighbors yard.. Why they have to come thru my yard? That's beyond me.  They woke up my newborn by ringing the doorbell every day at 7am.  During the week.  What if I was at work? Then when they finally get working they tear up my yard and have wires hanging over from my neighbors yard.  The grass is destroyed, they barely covered their hole they dug.  They just have no clue what they're doing and have terrible customer service.  I would never get century link myself nor would I ever recommend it to anyone."
1,"Been here a few times, but most recently the other day.  Taking Mona's suggestion - I had the andouille sausage linguine and it was decent.  My friend had the flank steak that I wish I had ordered.  It was cooked to perfection and rested in a blackberry mole reduction.  On previous visits, I've had the atlantic salmon and vegetable lasagna - both great choices.  The service is usually good, except this time I felt the server was either overly attentive - borderline rushing us....but it wasn't a big deal.  The environs are terrific - white tablecloths with kitschy cute 1940s classroom chairs.  Weird touch, but retro cool.  A recommended central Phoenix favorite.\n\nUPDATE - 1/25/07\nThe hostess was very gracious and accommodating checking on us every so often as we had drinks and waited for our table.  The owner came out and chatted with us after the meal to make sure everything we great, and even went back to the chef to clarify ingredients for me, plus added a little back story on the halibut sandwich w / german potato salad.  Definitely a friendly, homey atmosphere.  Loved it."
1,"We needed to have our old reverse osmosis system replaced but were having trouble finding a good price. The company we'd used to service our existing system for 10 years had become very pushy with sales pitches and gave us an outrageous quote on a new system. After calling several places, a family member recommended AHW. I'm so thankful! I was able to talk to a knowledgeable person right away and get an immediate quote. Their quote was the best I received. They then offered same day service and had someone out that afternoon. The installer, Jose, was very professional, called ahead to tell me exactly what time he'd arrive, and then arrived on time. He got the job done, was polite, and answered all our questions. We are very happy with our AHW experience and would highly recommend them to others. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with this fine company."
1,"My boyfriend and I visited this day spa yesterday after purchasing a Groupon. The interior is nicely designed with light music and had that signature lavender smell of a spa.  Check-in was easy and we filled out all the normal paperwork. The woman at the front counter was busy answering the phones, making several Groupon appointments, but we weren't offered any water or the typical,  'Your massage therapist will be right with you' once we turned in the paperwork. I was greeted by Dominic a short time later and led back to my room.\n\nThe room is typical for a day spas. The only ambiance in the room was a candle holder on the wall. There was a counter in the back and a small bench to place your clothes in the corner. The music continued to play in the room on the overhead speakers throughout the massage. It would have been nice to see a little more decoration in the room to make it feel more inviting. I'm not sure why these places don't invest a little more into decorations and give it a true spa feel. Additionally, the music overhead was okay but it would be a nice touch to be offered a different music selection if possible. Granted, this is all wishful thinking and above and beyond what you typically see in a day spa but it would have put this place over the top because my massage was fantastic!\n\nDominic asked if there way anything I needed extra attention on before starting and he did an excellent job of massaging just the right places. I've had several massages before but I would say this is definitely one of my top. Maybe it was because of his technique (long, slow movements) but it definitely was something I enjoyed very much. He never asked how the pressure was (I requested Medium) but luckily it was perfect throughout. Would highly recommend him to anyone!"
1,"CrossFit Southwest is an awesome gym, Ken and Matt are really great trainers who will support you and help you in your fitness and life goals.  The whole atmosphere at the gym is upbeat and positive.  Drop in for a workout and see for yourself."
1,The chicken shwarma is awesome!   The fries are hand cut and really good. Service is quick and the prices are reasonable. May have found my new lunch spot!
0,"Purchased a used vehicle and had a very bad experience with the sales manager who was very unprofessional. Basically we negotiated a verbal deal on a Friday, I had to goto the bank and would be back Monday to purchase. He said he could not hold the car, which I understood. When I returned Monday he almost refused to sell me the car at the price we talked about because he said he would not go that low. Even the sales person I was talking to said we agreed on the price. After finally agreeing and making me feel very unappreciated and talked about to other employees while signing papers we left with the car.\n\nThe Toyota service and Volkswagen service have both been great overall, even though toyota always tries to upsell you random things while you wait for an oil change, but the wait room is nice, free shuttle, car wash, etc makes it a good deal."
0,Food is pretty good. I do enjoy their country style steak. But it's only available certain nights. The past few times we have been we have had this waitress that just made the whole experience  awful. She makes fun of anything we say or do. She does it so loud that other customers stare. She rushes us to order and then rushes us out the door when we are done. She may think she's joking/funny but she's very rude and embarrassing. Won't be returning for a while that's for sure
1,"Love this place!\nThis place is super cute & service was stellar. Seems like a really neat place just to hang out for a while and catch up with friends!\nWhat we sampled:\nMaple glazed bacon: Duh, it obviously was amazing.\nCheese Grits: Yep, delicious\nBloody Mary: this was just OK\nFrench 75: Really good one!\n\nWe just came in and snacked, but are planning on coming in sometime for breakfast because the things we did sample were pretty delish! Also, they get a lot of stuff for their breakfast menu (and I'm assuming the rest of their menu) from the fruit stands at the market down the street! So fresh and yummy!\n\nPros: Atmosphere-loved the quirky decorations and laid back feel, food, drinks, service, purse hooks under the bar :)\n\nCons: Bloody Mary, creepy art upstairs...sorry but that was Creepsville USA up there. I'm all for the art gallery upstairs, just not a bunch of death/execution scenes right before I eat my breakfast. yikes."
1,"I have been going to this deli for many years. It has changed locations and chaged owners but its never lost anything along the way. I would say its got better as the years have gone on. By far the best bread in town baked in house everyday. Every party or  get-together i have or go to I will always stop here and grad some bread. They have Boars Head meats which is the best great Italian sausage that comes in from Chicago. They have great lunch specials. They have take home pizza kits. They include the dough, cheese, sauce, and peperoni. They are good! Check this place out if your in the area. The bread is worth going out of your way to get."
1,"I'm glad that they have a frozen yogurt place near Desert Ridge.  This was my first time in Yogurt Plus.  They had a nice variety of flavors and they had sample cups too.  :)  \n\nSo,  I tried a couple flavors and most of them were really good.  I got cake batter, strawberry, peanut butter and coconut.     \n\nIt is nice that they just opened up across for Desert Ridge.  Since Mojo just closed at City North a couple of months ago."
0,"They don't honor advertised services. Basic services (oil, inspection, tire rotation) with NO appointment in 30 mins but WITH an appointment it's an hour and a half!?\nService man Adam, denied said advertisement then did some stumbling when I showed it to him. ....still tried to deny it! I give one star for them answering the phone.....crap"
0,Food poisoning alert!  My husband and I both had It.  We called to let them know and they expected me to go to the ER and have a doctor's note! They wouldn't even refund our bill and after our gift card it was only $22. I guess it was worth it to them. They said they'd call me back for some unknown reason and never did.
0,"When the office contacted me to remind me of the appointment, they asked for my ex-husband.  I told them the appointment was for me.  The next day they called again asking for my ex-husband because my insurance couldn't be verified (because I have different insurance than my husband).  Again, I told them the appointment was for me.  When I went in for my appointment, they stood in front of me holding my ex-husband's file saying my insurance can't be verified.  Now a 3rd time, I reminded them I wasn't my ex-husband.  They called me up to fill out paperwork ten minutes later with my husband's name on the paperwork!!!!  Can we say HIPAA violation?\n\nThey asked me for a copayment twice before realizing that my insurance doesn't require a co-payment for a physical.  Why do I have to educate insurance verification staff?\n\nAfter I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to see Dr. Sink, she rudely interrupted me as I was describing my symptoms and said if I wanted to talk about health issues, I needed to make another appointment and pay a copay,  this visit was for a physical only.  I offered to pay the co-payment so I wouldn't have to wait such a long time. She said my appointment time has already been booked as soon as the office realized I was a physical only patient.\n\nShe then went on to give me a lab form for blood work with my maiden name on the form.  I had a name change 4 years ago and have been to that office since the change.\n\nI will never return to this office."
0,"My BFF and I decided to wander the streets and discover an unknown gem as we always sometimes do. It's either a hit or miss. \n\nSo come upon Cartel, and by the menu seemed a nice place to try- with such a cheap menu and so many great options, we giggled that we could try almost anything and still be affordable. She checked her services online (the reviews) and we decided to go in.\n\nWith the advice of a previous review it said to order right away as it takes a while for the food to come. And so within 5 minutes we were ready and prepared for the wait. The waitress recommended that we order the \""happy hour\"" drinks right away as it was almost 8pm. $5 wines, and beers & any mixed drinks (not cocktails). So we ordered and had the white wine. Then we ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. The waitress brought the bottle and fumbled with it for 5 minutes, she actually couldn't open the bottle. My gf eventually asked if she needed help and opened the bottle herself.\n\nWe ordered the Charlevoix burger, maui burger, beef satay, chicken satay, pork belly bao, guacamole with chips.\nTrue to form the order came almost 15-20 minutes later- the Charlevoix burger and pork belly boa came first. Ah, no wonder it's cheap. They were the size of sliders, maybe a little bigger. Okay, gotta admit it was good. So good that we ordered another pork belly bao (sliders). \n\nThe beef and chicken satays came another 10 minutes later. They were average, nothing spectacular. My Maui burger came another 10 minutes later. This was also ver good. Finally the 2nd order of pork belly bao came 10 minutes more later...it was COLD, as if it was sitting there for some time and then they placed it in the microwave to heat. This order was NOT good at all. \nBy this time, we were in a need of shots. We wanted to have PATRON shots but were told that they couldn't give us the patron shots (they had to be in a drink) but any other shot we could have. WTF? Where in this planet is this place from? \nSo we ordered $12 margaritas. They surely take their damn time in this place. \nOh, and the guacamole we ordered? We almost forgot about it until it came out 40 minutes into our meal. It was MEH. We had to add a bunch of salt and hot sauce to make it better. We wanted to wait for the margaritas to eat them with. We almost waited 15 minutes! The margaritas came in short water glasses filled to the brim with ICE. I think I took 3 sips of the drink before it was all gone. OMG. What a waste.\n\nWe were so excited coming in and at the end was totally disappointed. The service is below par...the girl was very nice but all the waiting didn't make it feel like any service. We were going to talk to the manager but we were in a such foul mood that we would've probably taken it out on him. Our server didn't get a great tip. NEVER AGAIN!"
1,"Had a nice dinner this past weekend at Mon Ami Gabi.  We were seated on the veranda and able to view the fountains at the Bellagio.\n\nMy wife had the mussels marinere and said they were good, but not the best.  Generous helping and much larger than her favorite P.E.I. mussels but edible.  I had the Dijon mustard steak.  It was good, but a very thin slice and rather salty.  We both had the frites (fries) and they were very tasty.  By far the best was the warm baggette and butter served at the table.\n\nThe waiter was very friendly and service was prompt and not rushed.\n\nAll in All, a nice place to have dinner in Vegas!"
0,"My son wanted to try the Better Butter and I saw they had Chicago mix so I decided to try them both.\n\nPrices are not bad but they weren't very special in flavor, I wouldn't stop again."
1,"Pretty darn good breakfast.  Reasonably priced - generous portions, a notch above the fray.  The service was also very attentive, our coffee never saw empty.\n\nAs everyone has already attested, the pancakes here are prolific.  Crispy bits that could only be created on a really hot griddle, fried with what I imagine to be some deliciously heart clogging fat - like bacon grease or Crisco (unconfirmed).  The corn beef hash was also excellent.\n\nI'd bring a friend."
0,"Cheap and decent, but your towers are too far away from each other."
1,"Every time my husband and I visit vegas, we buy bath bombs from here. \nWe love their Lemon, Satsuma, and the green one. \nWe usually only buy it for during the days we're in vegas. \nThis visit, we bought the Milk Bath as well. \n\nQuality wise, honestly, it's not crazy grand and slightly overpriced if you think about it that way. However, it's worth the splurge (1-2 times a year) and totally relaxes us during the stay."
1,Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service
0,"The food is good, but the owner who is involved most displays horrible customer service and yells at his employees constantly.  They also pay late, as well as bounce checks and underpay.  They owe me $800+ in payroll currently.  Awesome business ethics.\nIf you do eat there, try the chili and the Fresh Catch salad w/ shrimp."
1,"Okay . . . Sushi Samba came up another star in my book all due to bartender extraordinaire- JEN! \n\nOn another visit here- Jen took such great care of me- suggesting her favorite items on the menu, making sure my glass was never empty and most importantly- recognizing me from my last visit (how do bartenders do that?), that I just had to move this review up a notch. \n\nThe food was still good (kumomoto oysters tonight- delicious!), the drinks, well poured- but the friendliness and spirit of one bartender named Jen made all the difference in this visit. Must be that she moved out here from Illinois!\n\nThanks Jen! See you on my next trip to Sin City!"
0,"The folks running this place remain enthusiastic and friendly, but the food has become a bit too sweet, even the savory dishes are much too sweet. It is too bad as I really liked the food the first few times we went."
1,"A bunch of classmates came back for homecoming on Saturday and we chose this place as sort of home base as they have wi-fi.  We had a pretty good brunch here, went for the football game then returned afterwards with our laptops to get a bit of work done and grab a few light bites to eat before the receptions in the evening.  Service was excellent, food was great as was the presentation.  It feels like a cozier loft environment.  Everything is made on premises. They seem to be enthusiastic about pointing out that they have their own little bakery on site.  \n\nFor breakfast, at the recommendation of the server, I had the Salmon Benedict (picture uploaded) which was two eggs benedict with smoked salmon plus sides for $13/14 pre-tax and tip.  It was very good.  There weren't actually too many people around at around 11 am but this was probably because it was cold raining and generally miserable outside.\n\nWhen we came back, one of my somewhat adventurous friends ordered the bone marrow appetizer which he quite enjoyed, I had a carrot + sweet potato soup and another friend ordered the calamari (all pictured).  I was happy with my soup which was $6 pre-tax and tip.  To their credit, they let us plug in and work for a few hours before 6 pm but this was before their dinner rush which gets very busy (reservations definitely recommended).\n\nPrices were definitely on the higher end for the area but I'd also say it was well worth it.  I was debating whether or not to give them a 4 because of this but in thinking about it, their pricing created high expectations which they more than met.  I agree with another reviewer that the vibe is very similar to Wildcraft though it's more of a loft/romanticized factory-type feel to it.  \n\nThe one thing about this place is that the parking is a bit wonky.  It's on the first floor of the Bauer Lofts and to get to the restaurant, I think there's only one entrance in and from street level it might be a little confusing as it's physically inset.  There is as well underground parking which is a bit easier as the signage from inside/under the building is a lot clearer than outside."
0,"For someone who doesn't like buffets, I end up eating at a lot of buffets. We met here to try the Hawaiian buffet items that they carry on Tuesdays. The price is $12.99 with a player's card. \n\nThe only things I would be interested in eating again were the roast pig and bbq pork. The rest of the food didn't do much for me. Most of the main dishes and sides I tried were over salted and the dessert options were just sad. The only thing I liked from the desserts were the little cream puffs that you can buy at the grocery store. \n\nService was sufficient, but there were times that dirty plates and empty drink glasses sat a little longer than I would have liked. The sodas on the second round of drinks were all flat, so no one drank them and it was hard to find our server again to get them replaced. \n\nThey have singers and a hula dancer that come around to entertain everyone on Tuesdays. It was pleasant, but I would have preferred they stuck to one corner of the buffet instead of moving around to each table, since we had to awkwardly sit through their set, afraid to be rude and walk up to get more food while they performed. \n\nI heard other patrons complaining about the price since it was a special menu that they weren't anticipating. \n\nThey did have a good amount of Hawaiian items to choose from, if you're interested in checking it out and the price seems about right for it. Just make sure you sign up for their player's card to receive the discount, since it's about four dollars more if you don't have one. One player's card will get you the discount for up to two diners."
0,"Was at the Excalibur for Memorial day weekend (5 days total). Check in easy enough, however we were told we were getting a free upgrade! Lol carpet stained, smelled bad, beds were hard as rocks! Could have sworn it was a box spring. Sheets and pillows were filthy stained as well as the towels.  View was of the roof. Staff still enters room with privacy tag up to change linens with more stained linens. And no wi-fi had to hit up starbucks to get a signal. Who doesn't have wi-fi? Everywhere else had wi-fi.\n\n    Leavin tower every day we were harassed by people trying to sell time shares and dicount show tickets that were crap. (They say free but they are not.) Big scam. Every day it was same people and same pitch. Unrelenting\n\n     We did breakfast buffet,  unimpressive. And way overpriced. Had upset stomach the entire day after eating that food. It was all bland. Would have been better off eating mcdonalds every day. \n    \n     Gambling in Excalibur cocktail waitresses we're non existent,  but when you got one they were abrasive and by comparison of the other casinos very old and unattractive and rude to match. \n\n     The large pool was closed all but one day! But they kept the adult pool that you have to pay $10+ to get into open with 3 patrons (4 lifeguards). I would say bad idea. Drinks were super expensive bring at least $40 cash with you to drink at the pool. \n\n     I will probably never stay at the Excalibur again it is out dated and under staffed to keep up on the hotel and casino. This will contribute to further deterioration of the casino. (Resort fee?) Ha what resort? Small uprade to motel 6 but with a casino inside."
1,"My fiance and I have been here a couple of times. White tablecloths and a quiet, comfortable atmosphere--with jazz music playing in the background. They have an interesting menu, including Chinese and Thai food, and tasty appetizers. This is a nice place to sit down, relax, and enjoy.  We were well served and our food was delicious--both times. The house salad is simple but has a nice ginger dressing."
0,"Booked for the Sheraton ( over a month in advance) during the ACC Championship, check-in was 3pm we got there a little after 3 and were told that our room wasn't clean yet and they'd call my cell when it was ready. Albeit frustrating they comped our parking and the lobby was full of ppl in the same boat so we sat down at the bar for a beer. An hour later we went back to the front desk and were very rudely told that there were no available rooms and no estimation for when a room would be available, but they'd gladly take our number. After 30 mins. I  watched two groups of ppl walk in the door, check-in and immediately receive room keys. After waiting in line for 15-20 mins while other patrons argued with the staff and received keys, I plead my case and was rewarded with a room on the Le Meridian side of the hotel (much newer and nicer). Bathroom was small and the air conditioner a little slow to work but otherwise once we actually got a room it was nice!"
0,"Terrible service on Christmas Eve! Waitress doesn't want to be here and she made that very clear. Asked her how her night was..... \""It's Christmas Eve I would rather be with my kids.\"" Wow not really sure where to go from there way to make it awkward. Food great. Atmosphere usually great. But really if you are trying to pull at heart string for a bigger tip by telling me how much you hate being at work no go kitten sorry."

I know that.\n\nBut this is Circque du soleil. of course they made a name already, I had great expectations--which makes it hard for me to accept my fate this night.\nI was literally sleeping at the last 1/4 of the show. Or was i tired? I was disappointed @ the end of the show or was i just mesmerized with Kooza's experience.\n\npoor story line, music was not really grandiose and the margins of the concept were so ambiguous. I hope they dont repeat what clicked in other shows next time. I wouldve seen Ka had i known this like this."
0,"I'm surprised by the positive reviews on this shop. I can't speak to the lolli cakes or ice cream concoctions (which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1), but I had the opportunity to try an assortment of the chocolate treats. Based on the reviews I expected to enjoy them, but I was very disappointed. First, the chocolate wasn't glossy, and some of the pieces had the grayish film that indicates age, improper tempering, or extreme temperature variations. Also, the chocolate did not taste smooth and velvety like good chocolate should. Instead, some pieces were almost flavorless, and others left an unpleasant aftertaste. The idea of sea salt caramels is a good one, and I've sampled successful samples in other shops. But here the proportions of chocolate, caramel, and salt are off, and the salt is too overpowering. Chocolate can be tricky, but in a city with numerous choices, there are many other better options."
1,"It was my boyfriend & I's last night in Las Vegas and I had been dying for sushi so we decided to check out Koi! I definitely wish we had gone earlier in the trip because the food was amazing. We shared the vegetable tempura, seared tuna, and crispy rice. The fish tasted so fresh and it was at such a reasonable price (especially compared to the other restaurants we went to in Vegas). For dessert, we got the strawberry cobbler & it was just the perfect touch of sweetness to end our dinner.\nThe restaurant is more like a lounge, with   a slightly romantic ambiance, which i loved! Sadly, we had to go back to Canada, but like I always say \""C'est la vie!\"" \nI can't wait to come back!"
1,This is by far one of my favs. For the uniqueness and decadence they bring to each dish. We had a great experience and will definitely be back again!\n\nIf you are a first timer try the Lamb Pastrami it's amazing!
0,"I was at the Visulite Saturday night and it was a terrible experience. I bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show. It was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts. We got there right on time and were denied entrance. Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What? Then we were told, \""it was made very clear on the website\"" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like, \""don't make me pull up the website.\"" If it was made so clear... why were we having this discussion? To say the least, the guy taking/selling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully. He not only told said, \""are you talking about MY ticket guy in there? you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back!\"" Really? First of all, I'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks HIS job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there. What am i going to do? kick him in the shins? tell him he's a meanie? there are better ways to handle a situation. Second, I was not talking back to this guy or arguing. I was trying to figure out why on earth I would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue. We ended up going to Crown Station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show. Again, the door guy was a bully saying, \""looks like you came back for a 2nd try, huh? you better watch yourself this time.\"" To say the least, I asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening. I have to say, the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over. This used to be my FAVORITE venue in Charlotte to see music, but after this terrible experience, I will not be returning. I remain very upset about this situation and can't imagine the band would be very happy knowing their fans are being bullied and talked down to at the front door. As for the sound... once we finally made it in, it was extremely loud and impossible to hear any words that the guys were actually singing. Super bummed about the whole evening... but would also be very willing to talk to a manager..."
1,"Great coffee, staff and atmosphere."
1,"Since I moved to AZ from NY about a year ago, I have been disappointed  by  dozens of AZ restaurants that claim to be \""New York Style\"". Not just Italian restaurants. I'm just as disappointed by AZ yelpers who think they know what authentic NY style is. So it was, with trepidation, that I heeded the advice of the reviews previous to this one, and booked a table for ten for a pre theater dinner. Well, you see the five stars. How good is RigaTony ?\nLets start with service. We were pretty late for our 4:30 reservation after being stuck in traffic on the 10. They held the table, no problem, on a very busy evening. Even though we ordered our plates after 5 we got the early bird specials and the $3 glasses of wine. Again, not a problem. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very efficient. Sodas and waters were refilled without prompting. Sorry, I didn't get her name. \nThe food. Fresh Chapati comes to the table almost immediately . There are bottles of olive oil and small dishes of freshly chopped garlic too.  Make your own concoction. The early bird pasta dishes offer a good variety of  pasta and accompaniment, are plentiful, tasty and offered in fresh semolina or whole wheat and a great value at $6.95. Three of us ordered the veal parm which we all agreed was tender, tasty, and large enough to satisfy. The sauce was thick, tangy and garlicky, much like Carmines or many of the midtown (Manhattan) Italian eateries. Also ordered at our table was lasagna and a clam and mussel dish. All were very happy with their meal. The tab for it all was very reasonable.\nThis is not a franchise restaurant. It is the real deal. RigaTony could make it in NY. The fact that it is in Tempe is, i think, fantastic."
1,"Wow !! The Sage Fried Chix Benedict dish was ORGASMIC !! Huge and I ate the whole thing ( Never ate the rest of the day) Every bite uncovered bacon or eggs or a biscuit, this is a close to glutanny as one could get and walk away unscathed !! This dish was a work of art and the chef a rockstar in my mind, wish I took a photo of it !! I will return and you should too !! Plaza charges 5 bucks to park but get the tix validated and the main casino cage gives you your 5 spot back !! \""Nuff said !!!"
1,"So not like after 63 reveiws and still a 5 star rating is my review necessary as I think we all get the point....BUT it is just so good I have to put in my 2 cents!\n\nThe flavors, the textures, the sweet girls behind the counter...everything is fantastic! I love love love the salted butter carmel and the basil lime sorbet is wonderful!\n\nSeriously...can't get enough of this place!!"
0,Customer service here blows! I order online so there shouldn't be any confusion about my order. I open the box for my cinnamon sticks and there is RANCH for dipping?? I call the store and he offers to bring what I actually ordered but prefers to credit it from the order.... Uhhhh that should be credited and you still need to bring me what I ordered! Really Really disappointed in pizza delivery lately! Especially since your stupid tip was 30%!
0,"Love the shop. Love the baristas. Love the coffee. Hate the smokers who swarm the outside patio and make drinking coffee outside hell for non-smokers. The friendly staff has no interest in enforcing the non-smoking city law and Starbucks policy!  If you are a non-smoker, it is inside or nothing.  If you smoke, the patio is open!"
0,"Is \""macho\"" supposed to mean that you don't know how to cook so you go on the cheap to feed people either bland, tasteless, re-heated frozen food or put so much sugar in it that you hope they won't notice it and then charge them way too much for it?  If so, El Hefe in Tempe has nailed it!\n\nFirst, I have to say that I work right next door to this location. I've seen the transformation from Canteen to El Hefe and honestly, I don't get it.  Canteen fit pretty well into the surrounding shops while having a unique store front appearance.  \n\nEl Hefe, on the other hand, is this massively gaudy, wood and steel behemoth that has overextended their boundaries.  They've stretched their front patio space nearly out onto Mill avenue and their back patio has been extended almost over into the neighboring Five Guys and Jimmy Johns.  It's obnoxious.\n\nAs for the food, it is mediocre to bad.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were thin and well salted, but slightly stale.  These were accompanied by three salsas, a super sweet tomatillo (my coworker actually asked if there was relish in it), a pico de gallo that was okay - but needed some salt, lime and time to come together, and a red salsa that quite honestly didn't taste like anything.  \n\nI myself had the chicken tinga tacos with their \""green cilantro rice\"".  The rice tasted like something you'd get at the grocery store in a bag or box and just add the parboiled (minute) rice and seasoning mix to boiling water to make.  Nasty.  The chicken tinga tacos were just okay, having a hint of chorizo to them, but also very sweet to the point of overpowering any flavor of chicken that you might be hoping for.  This is exacerbated by their tacos in general being quite small (about 4\"" across).  I also noticed that the consistency from one taco to the next was quite off.  \n\nMy co-worker had an assortment of tacos.  The carne asada taco he quite liked.  The fish taco tasted \""old\"" to him, indicating that the single chunk of battered fish was likely straight from the freezer.  The pork al pastor taco was so sweet that he actually didn't finish it, stating it was one of the worst taco's he's ever had.\n\nSo.. seven small taco's, about a cup and a half worth of green minute rice with some cilantro in it, chips and salsa (which if I overheard correctly, they charge for salsa refills) and two waters came out to just under $30.  For two lunches that didn't satiate either of us.  Needless to say, we won't be returning."
0,"I'm giving them 1 star for food only.  Went there last night for 20th Wedding Anniversary and there were only a few people there and our waitress was helpful for the first 5 minutes and then 2 bigger parties of people came in and our waitress only came back to bring me my salmon that was raw that I just told her to nuke (yet it took 10 minutes) for me to get it back.  In the meantime she was schmoozing the large table for obvious tip reasons.  There were only 3 of us since our daughter met us for dinner and the waitress had dollar signs in her eyes rather than service signs.  Both husband and I have waited tables before and are excellent tippers, but knew what was going on so she got a whopping 5 dollar tip from us.  An hour and 20 minutes later we were finally able to leave after getting the manager so we could get our bill and by now the restaurant was full and he had the audacity to say he was going to look to see when our ticket went up (like I was lying when I said we waited 45 minutes for our food and an hour for my salmon).  Anyway, my husband rates this place a 0, but knows I like it okay so took me there.. Now we're on the same page.  \n\nGlad I'm a local so I can spread the word.  Was fun sipping on one beer and ice cubes since filling up my water glass was too much for our waitress.. It's always more frustrating when you watch the other diners she's laughing with and running around for knowing they're having a good experience for the evening.  Bummer for the 20th.  No more going out on anniversaries..  With a smaller party you just get ignored when there's more money to be had elsewhere.  Shame on them."
0,Putting it nicely the guy that runs the shop is named Jos\u00e9 and just because he is wearing some stupid piece of gold and gun on his belt thinks he can be rude obnoxious and a thief.horrible in communicating with anyone worth anything and programmed to deal only with lowlifes like himself.
1,"In my 32 years of life I have never ever had such an amazing experience as I did last night. Our waiter Mags and his team took such great care of us. The music, atmosphere and insane food are out of this world. I have never hugged my waiter after a meal but we felt like family once we left. We can't wait to go back."
1,"(Lyrics - James Blunt - You're Beautiful)\n\nThe food is excellent\nMy mouth is full\nI saw a wine list\nOf that I'm sure\n\nShe smiled at me as I ordered\nShe had many patrons at hand\nBut they won't lose me as a customer \nCause I'm a big fan\n\nNosh Arizona, Nosh Arizona\nNosh Arizona, it's cool\nI saw your place in a magazine space\nAnd I thought I'd go to you\nCause I'll always be coming back to you\n\nNosh=to eat food enthusiastically or greedily.  Indeed, I'm guilty of this heinous deed!  However, I have to say I was damn hungry!  I came with a gal pal and we sat at the kitchen bar.  Nosh is definitely a cute setting and relaxing atmosphere.  Located in Chandler it's a rare find!  \n\nWe ordered...well I should say I ordered the Apple Gorgonzola pizza to share or not!  Needless to say scarfed it down!  The sweetness of the cheeses meshed well with the saltiness of the maple bacon while the hint of bitterness came from the arugula.  Yummy yummy yummy indeed!\n\nThey have a nice wine list, but I'm a beer guy so had to get my favorite Magic Hat.  Overall, great dine and wine place and with some live music this place would pop! - Enjoy!"
1,"VEGAN DONUTS OH MY FUCK\n\nis pretty much all that needs to be said. Day two of APP, my friend Lilly showed up with a few boxes full of vegan donuts and It was perfect for that morning.\n\nGranted, I'm usually semi health-conscious, so I totally felt unhealthy for eating vegan donuts like 6 times while I was in Vegas.\n\nSo worth it. Will be going back."
0,"Save yourself the ANGER and DISAPPOINTMENT and DO NOT GO HERE!!! This place actually gets ZERO stars! I decided to try this place out based on the reviews on here. I just got my hair done here by Ashley. This place is equivalent to a Super Cuts, from the look of the salon to the service to the knowledge of the stylist. I refuse to call my girl a stylist because she was far from that! I was 5 minutes early to my appointment and she took a walk-in before I got there who wanted her grey hair colored and her black hair bleached to color it purple. Ashley clearly is NOT a multitasker. She was not able to give either one of us the attention we deserved as paying customers. Ashley left the bleach on too long and patches of the other ladies grey hair uncolored. The lady ended up coloring her own hair. To make the situation worse, as Ashley was cutting my hair she got a phone call from her family member and they began to argue as she continued to cut my hair. As for my hair, my layers, lift and volume are not what I wanted. I even showed Ashley a pictured and described exactly what I wanted. Ashley wasn't even capable of washing my hair. When I got home I noticed that I still had hair product left over from yesterday and had to re-wash it. EXTREMELY ANGRY AND DISAPPOINTED!"
1,The pork torta is a must as is most of the menu. The drinks are a little pricey but besides that I would recommend this place to anyone.
1,First time coming here.  Just got the standard $5 wash (it's $3 Monday - Friday).  Pretty decent job for a quick automated wash.  Didn't use the vacuums this time but will in the future!!
1,"Today was my first encounter with the infamous Four Kegs and the stromboli (original). I always wanted to check the place out and try the stromboli since seeing it on Triple D. After multiple times visiting Vegas, I finally tried it. However, my experience would be as a take out order. I must say, the stromboli did not disappoint. I loved how it tasted, nice crisp, crunchy buttery crust and gooey cheese melted with the sauce and meats. Next time I need to experience Four Kegs as a whole, dining, eating and drinking. Till the next time.."
1,"This place is the perfect location for drinks before/after a show at the Overture! I wish they were open when I used to live down here. There's a pool table, and the place feels very spacious. I wish they had more sofa-like seating though. I can imagine people playing board games down here."
1,"If its winter, bring a coat. If its summer, use flip-flops and tanks. I get lost here, but its a \""good\"" lost ya know?!"
1,"This place was a bit small, but it reminds me of some sushi restaurants in Cali due to the many different variety of Japanese food you can find on the menu. I haven't been to another Japanese restaurant that has fresh sea urchin, etc. like this one. I will definitely go back again."
0,"We had dinner here this past week and I have to say that service is amazing but the food is just bleh. We had a guacamole appetizer: I've bought better tasting guacamole from the grocery store. I ordered a roasted half chicken with tortillas rice and beans. For $15 i could have ordered 3 times as much at El Pollo Loco and received way better food. The chicken was dry and tasteless, smothered with some kind of bland red sauce. The homemade tortillas that came with it were pretty good. My hubby got a tamale and it tasted way better than my chicken. My kids ordered the kids meal of chicken fingers and fries, and they liked theirs. It was just disappointing to pay for a $100 meal (including tip), for something I could have got for 1/3 of the price."
0,"So please bare with me as I write this review. I literally just signed up so I can talk about this place, as well as others. Like Matthew G's review, this too is based off of the service.\n\nSo it's a Sunday night, and a friend of mine was feeling like Italian so we decided to try this place out. We walked in and there were quite a few people, it wasn't too overly crowded. There was no hostess so the waitress told us that she would get to us asap. Well, she forgot about us and another waiter sat a group of 3 before us. So that waiter sat us right away. Now all I ordered was a pepsi and my friend ordered a house salad with spaghetti with meatballs. The place did get busy, but again, not too extreme. After about 40 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. I'm sure the food is outstanding, but then again, we never got it. So we decided to get up and leave and head down to Venezias, which is on Cooper and Ray. We ordered the exact same thing, and her salad came out in 5 minutes, and dinner out in 10 minutes still piping hot. As far as the service goes, I don't recommend going, but I would definitely love to try the food, IF I wanted to wait for almost an hour. Better off going to Venezias."
1,"Rock-n-Roll Yoga is really a good class. Or maybe it's that Natalie (Martina? Nikola? Sorry, I don't remember) is a good teacher. Good voice, good rhythm. The rock-n-roll part wasn't as rockin' as I'd hoped, but that's ok, it was still fun. 45 minutes, great for a vacation-sized class. I'd give the class 3 stars, but it gets 4 because of the aweeeesome locker room which is super convenient for going to class then changing and going to the pool. All in all, a good experience!"
1,"Man, this place is great! Incredible atmosphere, friendly services, prices were great, and the food was great!  I had the jerk chicken wings and the flavor was fantastic.  Although the portions were nice, I found myself wanting more!  I ate outside in a cafe style atmosphere which was perfect!  The place was clean and the staff was very lively.  I can't wait to get back to try something else on the menu! Have my eye on the shrimp!"
1,"I have been here a few times now and I love it! The tacos are delicious (recently tried the lamb - yum!), the margaritas supreme, and the atmosphere is fab. I recommend this to anyone wanting to try a new place in Midtown."
1,"I love Planet Beach. The staff is very friendly and the place is clean. I can get as many spa treatments  as I want each month for a monthly fee.  I have been a member for over 2 years. Some services book up faster than others so It is good to call ahead of time. They also have on-line booking so you can book services anytime. There are times that I have not gone for a few weeks, but try to get in at least 1x a week for services and a spray tan."
1,"After moving here from Los Angeles, I was glad to see that there was a Vespa dealership here. Everytime that I have gone in to Vespa of Charlotte, the staff has been super friendly and have been able to service my bike quickly! Clay, the salesman, had about a dozen suggestions for places to eat lunch while I waited...I might have to try one of them next time I am there for service :o)"
0,"Tried out Salon 3121 with a Living Social deal .....   the Massage with Caite was Great!!!  She is a skilled professional and wonderful at what she does....  go see her!! ....  Unfortunately the Mani/Pedi was possibly the worst I've ever had!  It was basically a $50 polish change that not only had polish smeared all over my skin, but both my fingers and toes chipped in less than 24 hours.... ridiculous!  Too bad as the Salon seems to have a nice atmosphere and various services offered......  the only thing I will return for is the massage."
1,I have lived in Chandler for over 30 years since I was a kid and I have never been to this location before. I had a birthday party here for one of my kids and we all had a GREAT time! The lady at the window coordinated everyone great (I think her name is Nicole) and kept checking in on us to make sure we were all having fun. It was Radio Disney time and the music was great and fun. My 7 year old had a blast and my 3 yr old did great using the skate mate. I could not keep him off the rink! Food was ok. We paid the group rate which was more reasonable than the birthday party rates. Look for specials and coupons this is really fun and affordable for the whole family. I skated for the first time since I was a teen!  My 2 small complaints...bathrooms are a little gross and it was a little warm in there. They need to crank the A/C down more. We cannot wait to come back on MJ night.
1,"I don't really know where these poor reviews come from - I've been eating at Kiku for years and have never had a bad experience. Yes, the lighting is dim and it's not exactly chic, but the food is excellent. Kiku was where I had my very first sushi, and it's hard for any sushi to live up to it. \n\nThe tuna and salmon rolls are always very fresh with the perfect amount of wasabi and their entrees are great, especially for those who don't like sushi or even Japanese food. And one of my all-time favorite foods is their tempura ice cream, with its sweet buttery tempura crust and fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Mmm. Delicious."
1,"I would recommend OBGYN Specialist to anyone!! I have felt that I matter to them as a person, not just a patient since the moment I walked in there a few years ago.  I recently suffered an ectopic pregnancy and they were on top of the situation medically as well as helping me emotionally.  The \""bedside manner\"" I received was one of a kind and I can't imagine going through this hard time with any other doctor."
1,"Pink Pepper is definitely a favorite place of mine to order from that's around the house.  From mouth-watering curry to crispy Thai toast, Pink Pepper has always hit the spot when it comes to a spice-craving.  I've never actually dined in, I always place my orders to-go, but the ambiance is quite nice.   Portions could be bigger but the quality usually makes up for the average prices and smaller portions.  They make a mean yellow curry!"
0,"I can honestly say that this one of the worst food experiances I have had since eating at a Uno's once when I was in hurry. I arrived at Circo with a large group of 11 people which we had a reservation for. We had asked for a table close to the windows so that we could hopefully get a view of the fountains but were seated far away in the center of the restaurant. I cannot blame them for this. I know it can be difficult to accomodate a large group in the prime location so this did not really bother me but it would have been nice.\n\nI am a huge foodie and I have eaten at many places as well as working in the industry for a significant amount of time so I consider myself to be pretty understanding and agreeable when it comes to dining. However, this was unlike anything I have ever seen.\n\nOur party was seated and a cocktail waitress promptly came over with i-pads containing the drink menus. Personally, I find this very odd because we are a table of 11 and obviously the restaurant only has a limited number of these i-pads so she sets down 2 at the table and we have to share and take turns sliding through the electronic pages. Completely STUPID in my opinion.... Just give me a regular drink menu... I can read just the same from paper as I can from an i-pad. So the cocktail server returns a few minutes later ready to take our drink orders. We all nod in response that we are ready to order something from her. She gets through about 4 people before leaving the table. After about 10 minutes she returns with the drinks for the 1st four people (completely ignors us as she rushes to set them down) and then leaves again. We finally had to flag down the server assistant to ask her to return so that the rest of the table could order their drinks too.\n\nWith our drinks finally in hand, we move on to order our meals. This goes pretty smoothly and we promptly get our salad courses. Then the never ending wait begins for our main courses. We waitied an hour and 30 minutes between when our salads were cleared and when we received our entrees. Now, I am very patient and don't mind a wait between courses but this was excessive even by my standards, and the rest of my table was not nearly as understanding and were vocally upset about the wait.\n\nMost of our table ordered the Filet, which seemed mostly okay. Some were slighltly overcooked but that was not the real problem. All of the steaks were served with the nastiest asparagus that I have ever seen. These spears looked like they had been under a heat lamp in the back kitchen for hours. I mean I have seen better looking asparagus at an Outback steakhouse or a buffet line.\n\nDuring out meal there was not 1 instance of any of the waitstaff coming by to check and see if everything was okay and to our liking.....which it certianly was not for nearly our whole table. It was honeslty some of the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant in all my life. The waitstaff was rude and the manager was not willing to even listen to our dismay for the issues with our food.\n\nI would not recommend Circo. There are so many options in Vegas and many of them well worth the price. Try Mortorano's Rao's or Lavo if you are looking for Italian."
1,"Wow very surprised to see a great quality food in a food court , very tasty Barbacoa and guacamole !!!!! Wow"
1,"I am huge fan of this place!  I have been going there for about 3 years now as they are very close to my office.  I can call in an order, drive over there in 5 minutes and it is ready for me.  It is always the same gentleman helping me as the cashier.  The quality of the food is AWESOME!!  I am pretty snobby about my Asian food :-).  The only thing that I get confused on is do I tip?"
1,Went to this shop today 10/17. It was closed. Now they have a Modern Sushi open in the old spot. Just for the benefit of other patrons looking for it -- its now CLOSED.
0,"This is a really fun looking place and it smelled great from the street.  You order at the counter and they call your number.  The place was really busy on a Sunday.  I ate lunch there today and ordered a 1/2 slab, slaw and beans.  I would like to give this place 2 1/2 stars but am erring low because the ribs were so tough, I couldn't eat most of them.  I actually couldn't get them apart to eat them.  The beans and slaw were a-ok but since I was there for the BBQ, I had to give them 2 stars.  It's really too bad because the flavors were really good and the sauce is really solid.  I will be back to try the chicken next time and may update the review at that time.  I would try it if I were you but I would definately skip the ribs."
1,"Was in for Labor Day weekend w/ the family, visiting ... family.  Asked My sister n Law, \""Wha's goo' 'round hurr\"" ( terrible texan accent, maybe it's 'cuz I'm not from there)  She had no clue and I had to whip out the phone.\n\nI was looking for something healthy, quick and nearby and .. BAM!  This lil' place had good reviews and I hadn't had a gyro in 4-5 days!\n\nGot there 5 min. after they opened, there was a chick taking pics of a plate ... prob. for some paper/mag. and the guy looked greek, the lady that took my order looked greek, so I was pretty confident that this place was going to be good.  11:15, this place was busy, no seats available and when I saw the Gyros come out, I knew why.\n\nEverything was fresh, except for the pickled stuff, obviously ,,,and I think they make their own Tzatziki sauce since I've haven't had cucumbers in long strips.  Delish!\n\nI highly recommend this place because they were not stingy on the proteins and that's always what most places skimp on.\n\ntook away a star since my order was lost in the shuffle due to a guy being late and didn't know who ordered first.\n\nThere is also outdoor seating but who the hell wants to sit out in 110 degree shade.... yeesh."
1,"Overpriced but what isn't in Las Vegas?\n\nThe restaurant is clean, elegant, quiet, and a bit secluded from the hustle and bustle of the strip despite being on it.  \n\nwe went for a light lunch and had the margarita pizza. I love a good margarita pie and I enjoyed it but for my husband, it was just cheese pizza."
1,"Just go for the espresso. Get it in a latte or a mocha. I've only been here twice but each time the espresso has tasted the way espresso should taste: sweet and tangy. If you are an espresso lover like me and need to find a place to stop in Madison, do not waste your time with other places. Ignore the hipsters and get your quality coffee at JPH."
0,"Uh...how is it that this place has so many good reviews?!  I love me a good burger and there are a few places in town that serve yummy burgers, Delux being one.  In retrospect we should have gone there instead but we, my beau and I, wanted to try a new place.  Yeah, well that'll learn us.  This place was soooo gross .  I don't think I have ever had such a greasy burger.  I was excited to see fried pickles on the menu, since I haven't had fried pickles since I left the South.  Well that excitement was quickly snuffed out after my first bite.  I think it's safe to say that we will  not being going back there again."
1,"If you haven't burnt all your money at the tables, finish it all off here!\n\nThere is something for EVERYONE at this seemingly endless mall...\n\nIf you enter Caesars' main casino entrance, expect a long walk through a loud, ringing, bustling casino floor & to see way too much of Celine Dion til you get to the mall entrance."
1,Hey this place rocks! Richard took care of us. The raw bar was fantasti please give it a try.you will not be disappointe
0,"The manager lady with tattoos all around her neck does not need to be in customer service field. Like talking to a brick wall. \n\nCashiers Do Not ask how your doing, if you have MyLowes card or anything. Everyone is a blank stare. \n\nI was told by an employee to order what I was looking for online, when I looked it up online there were 9 in this store. They just simply don't want to do anything at this store. \n\nBob Niblock needs to drive from Mooresville and lay down the law at this store."
0,"2.5 stars. I loved the decor, the steak and company was awesome, but oh the service. As we looked over the menu, I picked up their dining club brochure on a whim. The server took it upon himself to start explaining everything from one end to other without taking a breath. Not a great way to start off. When he finally left, we looked at each other with eyebrows raised.  After we had a chance to look over the menu, he came back and before we even ordered, again asked us if we wanted to join and repeated the 'benefits'. Commission, no? Simply put, it got annoying. \n\nAnyways, on to the menu. We decided to share an appetizer of three jumbo shrimp sauteed in dijon sauce. It was good, but could have been presented better on a small platter, not a large flat dish with literally three split shrimp rolling around. lol\n\nThe side of wild mushrooms was sauteed and delicious. The string beans had the option of sauteed in garlic or steamed; we got it steamed and we agreed they were a bit tough and possibly undercooked. \n\nOk, the filet mignon 9 oz. medium rare - sooo good. Cooked to perfection. The salmon was HUGE....neither of us could finish it. May have something to do with the taste, too - even though it was topped with butter, the fish itself was a little \""bland,\"" as my friend stated (his words, not mine!). \n\nAfter our plates were cleared and as I was leaning forward saying something, our server inserted a small-desk-sized platter of six desserts on the table and asked us which one we wanted. I remember a feeling of wow, a bit rude and I just lost my train of thought. Plus, he didn't even ask if we had room for dessert. Well, we didn't. \n\nNow I come on to yelp and find out they had restaurant week this whole time. The server didn't even mention this, even though my dish was on the special menu. Grrrr...."
0,I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
1,"On a red-eye layover to Newark I stopped here for dinner and a beer and had one of the best burritos, pleasant surprise b/c airport food usually isn't that great. \n\ncarnitas burrito is what I ordered."
0,"We sat outside.  Which was dusty & dirty of course, but we didn't mind.  \nOur waiter was nice, but did kind of smell like booze.  His service was quite slow at the start.  He kept coming outside to talk to the other waiter as if we weren't his customers too.  I don't want to hear about your personal shit, really I have enough of my own.\n\nWe both had a Pellegrino & a glass of wine.  \n\nWe had the Meat & Cheese Antipasto 12.95.  It was okay.  The mozzarella was like Poly-O.  The bread was dry & lacking in flavor.  \n\nFor my entree I had a pasta special which was okay.  The sauce was tasty, but for $16 I thought I would have received more of it.   It was only a very small portion.  In all fairness it was an Italian portion.  I just didn't feel it was worth it.  I wanted it to blow my mind...\n\nMy husband had the Spinach Salad.  It was just baby spinach leaves, pecorino shavings & some croutons.  Again, for $9.95 I felt it was a very small portion of salad.  \n\nWe skipped dessert.  \n\nOverall, nothing was awful about the meal, it just lacked in quality overall.  I figured since the owner is Italian it would have been better.\nIt was not worth the $80 that's for sure.  I would definitely not go back either."
0,"I was really excited about this place. The reviews were solid. \nWhen I looked on their site I was drawn to Justin's work for specific reasons, especially the way he tattooed trees.\nI went there with the intention of talking to him and setting up an appointment.\nAs I started talking about what I wanted (a tree coming from my mid forearm down onto my hand, lots of detail, etc), he basically just cut me off and explained to me that he hates tattooing trees. He said he gets at least one person a week inquiring about a tree tattoo and how he just hates them and doesn't feel inspired doing them. One of his co-workers walked in and Justin said something along the lines of, \""Oh he hates doing trees too\"" and the guy said, \""uhghhh I f*cking hate trees\"". \n\nNow lets be realistic, I am sure if I were a tattoo artist I wouldn't be too jazzed about tattooing the american flag on someones shoulder or a bald eagle on their back but I wouldn't put down someone's interest. I would simply explain that I would recommend someone else, but I wouldn't just blatantly make someone feel like an idiot.\n\nHe recommended me to go to someone else at the shop but I was so put off by the experience that I decided to go elsewhere (Ian at Club Tattoo on Country Club/US 60 is a lot nicer and actually talked to me about what I wanted).\n\nThe only part of getting tattoos that I hate is dealing with jerks who think they're far too awesome to be nice to someone with differing interests.\n\nI suppose if I were to cross paths with Justin again I would suggest him to take down the pictures of his work involving trees because I'm sure that's what is drawing people  interested in tree tattoos to him."
1,"Free salad bar !\n\nI came here to celebrate anniversary hehe :)\n\nWe've tried all the meat on the menu, and I gotta say, NON of them had disappointed me!\nExcellent service, they come by and check up on you every 15 minutes! At the end of our meal, they even came up to us with a complimentary flan with candles and decoration to wish us happy anniversary! very sweet!\n\nThey also have variety of wine choice( I didnt get to try it because wine makes me sleepy haha). \n\nIf you're in vegas, and dont wanna wait in line for buffet, this could be your back-up plans :)"
0,"Jack?! What the heck? You weren't on your A-game last night.\n\nI hastily ordered seasoned, curly fries and 3 egg rolls yesterday evening after a rough day at work. Okay, and a cheeseburger. And, Sprite. I had a bad day - don't judge!\n\nI arrived home in Fountain Hills and tore open my grease-splattered, hot bag of treats. My eggrolls were not in the bag but yet I was charged. Grrr - hate when that happens. Drive-thru lady was friendly but needs to double check bag orders to not piss off drive-thru patrons.\n\nPlus my fries tasted like they were sitting in the warmer for awhile. Dry and crunchy. Don't be lazy staff - dump and start again. Please! :)"
0,"I visited this location a couple of weekends ago. I was alone and just wanted to have lunch before I went to see a movie. I was seated in a section that was pretty much empty. I was placed in a corner and no server over to my table for 10 minutes. I even went so far as to make eye contact with a server and wave at her and she just looked away. I got up and went to the hostess station and told them that I wasn't going to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am a former server, bartender and host and I feel like this is unacceptable for the staff to flat out ignore someone."
0,"Visit 10/21 - 10/27.  Very disappointed in Housekeeping. Instead of everyday cleaning, the cleaning was very intermittent. I think 3 of my six nights there the room was cleaned.  However I'm positive that the sheets/pillowcases were never changed because of their \""go green\"" policy.  Got in elevator on Sat. night and slipped on laundry soap someone had spilled on the floor of elevator. Upon returning home I noticed bed bug bites from my ankles to my shoulders, and a puss filled spider bite on my stomach as well as a bad case of strep throat. Front desk staff were nice and took care of laundry soap spill in elevator I slipped in."
0,"I'm not the world's hugest Korean food fan, but if you have the word \""delicious\"" in your name, I expect to taste more than just kimchee and banchan. I love banchan, don't get me wrong, but the glossy food photos outside didn't really compare to the main dishes actually received here.\n\nFirst of all, sticker shock. I wasn't there for KBBQ (but maybe I should have changed my mind), but everything was like $25/dish. Pork and octopus stirfry was mostly kimchee with red sauce over a scant amount of octopus, a few other pieces of various seafood, and some other unidentifiable protein that must have been the pork.\n\nI gave the main dish to my guy and stuck to the sides: broccoli, pineapple, beansprouts, and daikon prepared various tasty ways. Oh, plus more kimchee. You know, if you hadn't had enough already.\n\nNow I know why this is the only restaurant in this plaza that never, ever has a wait. I'm just curious as to how they afford the rent, since no one ever seems to go in here, they have so few reviews, and no one was here during a super-busy night when I was, either."
1,"It's quieter, less traffic than the Wynn, if that's what you prefer. It is definitely just as beautiful. All the rooms are suites, with a sitting area. One thing I loved was that your HDTV is adjustable to face your bed...or the sitting area, with just a swivel! \n\nAll the amenities are high quality, and the service to match, whether you want extra towels or room service. Which I have to say was the best room service breakfast I ever had. Ever. I paid a good amount, but completely worth it. \n\nNice restaurants, great nightclubs, overall one of the best places to stay in Vegas..."
0,My girlfriend took my mini Australian Shepard here today as this is where her doggie goes. I'm not sure what was going through their mind when they shaved her all the way down. Seems to like there were lazy and didn't want to take the time to give her a proper groom. Hair was unevenly cut. She's a long haired mini Australian Shepard. Nobody wants this dog to look like a rat. You will never have my business again. Elite grooming on rainbow will continue to get my business as usual.
0,"It's Just a Hot Dog !! Two visits to JJs and I have had enough. I felt as if I was interrupting management and staff with work. There was no greeting...No \""May I help you? \"" No \""welcome to JJs\"" No nothing. This place needs personality. A Hot Dog joint needs at the very least a warm, welcoming spirit and ideally a unique personality. Now on to the Dog. All I wanted was what I call a Carolina Dog . Yellow mustard and cole slaw. That's it. Here you will pay a \""premium\"" for ...cole slaw. I'm thinking in NC we don't think of cole slaw as a premium item.But at JJs 3 dabs on your dog will cost you extra. Thankfully, yellow mustard was a standard ingredient. The dog was OK. Nothing special. Cole slaw very ordinary. My next whine ....is the packaging . I get the dog to go and damn if the container isn't worth more than the dog. Its a beautiful little Tupperware coffin designed perfectly to hold one dog in perpetuity,. Folks...Its just a Hot Dog !!  Wrap it up in tin foil and throw it in a bag."
1,"The Courtyard Cafe at the Orleans Casino has got to be one spot that any local or tourist come to! As you all know, this city is known as a city that does not sleep, and because we do not sleep as tourists coming here for the first time, or locals who are just plain insomniacs- we come to the Courtyard Cafe to take advantage of the Graveyard Special! Yes, there is such thing! \n\nThe special consists of the infamous $4.49 Steak & Eggs (with french fries or hashbrowns)!  Along with the steak & eggs, they provide bread and butter, which you also have the choice of what type of bread to eat!  There are also about 3 to 4 things on the graveyard menu, but this is what we all come for!  If you do decide to visit the cafe anytime before midnight, there is a 24 hour special on the double cheese burger, which you can customize to your liking (the rarity to how well-done the meat should be, the type of cheese, and you can also ask for a side of sauteed mushrooms with extra charge, but so worth it!)"
0,"Sweet frog is located beside starbucks in the matthews shopping center. It's the smallest space and there's not much room to move around. This location is packed during the summer months. The way they have the machines and toppings set up is fine, but it is really difficult to queue up and to know who is in front of you and who is not. The flavors are alright, nothing special. They have a TON of toppings, though. The employees are nice enough, but nothing really shines about this Froyo joint. I'd much rather go to YoForia or pinkberry."
1,"I heard really good things about this place....only problem it's all the way in NYC....Fortunately, I was able to find this place in Vegas so I had to try it. OMG it's hellla bomb. I guess NY style pizza really lives up to it's reputation & it's huge. We also got a large salad to split between 3 girls and still had some left over. I really wish I could eat grimaldi's everyday....FML"
1,"I brought home some really good cheese steaks from this location. I've tried the other location at happy valley, but somehow it tasted better this time."
0,"Came here after a pretty severe car accident and things seemed to be going fine for the first couple of months. I constantly told Dr. Johnson about tingling in my hands and feet but he didn't seem to pay too much attention to it so I wasn't too worried about it; until I woke up one day and couldn't move my neck either which way. He told me that sometimes after a big trauma that happens but still wasn't overly concerned- I told him my primary care doctor wanted me to go see a spine specialist: he balked and said that was absolutely ridiculous and that I was in the right place. Thank God I followed my instincts and went anyways because I found out I have a herniated disc in my neck and a ruptured ligament in my spine. Extremely disappointed that at no point, Dr. Johnson recommended an MRI or a referral to a specialist when symptoms continued to worsen. He just continued to act like he knew what was happening when he clearly had no clue. If you are just in for a maintenance issue then this place is fine, but if you have serious back issues then I would not recommend."
0,"Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was actually pretty good. However the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying \""just 2\"". As though 2 people was not enough. Well, I can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that I don't frequent very often."
0,Olde Mecklenburg beer in the Dortmund-style takes some effort to warm up to. Sampled all three currently available the other night and each one had a VERY harsh initial taste. German beer by it's nature typically mellows the Hell out after three or four sips... but not this stuff. Rolled on a second Copper and it finally started to get a tad better. Their winter brew is simply awful. This is really not what a German beer is supposed to be doing to you. \n\nOrdered a bratwurst and while the actual brat was pretty decent it was served up luke warm on top of a cold flavorless white bun. Very sad to experience. Guessing they boil these as it had zero sear marks.\n\nBrewery itself is off in an industrial area very close to I-77. The tap room is done up nicely. Lots of wood and warmth but that only means you'll have to stay there and drink the product.\n\nLastly make sure you MapQuest this place out for your visit because it'll take at least three employees to direct you there. \n\nHopefully they'll replace the current brewmaster with someone that's had German beer before. May be just OK to pop in and check out quickly.
0,This is a great concept and works well if you're flying out of terminal 3 or 4. If you're flying out of 2 this is such a pain! The train does not have a terminal 2 stop but the shuttles will not take you to the east economy lot from T2 so you have to take a shuttle to terminal 4 then catch the train from there. Sounds easy unless you're dragging luggage up and down stairs like I was. Took me 45 min to get to my car after the plane landed. I'm hoping the phoenix city council is working to fix this problem. Use Blue Sky if you're using terminal 2. Way easier!
0,"Great Service, but no BAM!  I ordered a signature dish: Onion Crusted Salmon over Andouille Hash with Emeril's homemade Worcestershire sauce.  The very good waiter suggested that the Salmon should be medium rare (just the way I like it).  What I got was cold fried potato chunks with cold dry sausage chunks underneath an over cooked salmon.  The so-called homemade Worcestershire sauce didn't appear to  be anywhere.  A sweet, unpleasant barbecue sauce was scattered around the plate.  To top it off, the \""onion crust\"" was cold, soggy onion strings.  I don't know how all of the items that need to be fresh off the grill could be so cold and soggy while the Salmon was over cooked.  Yuck!  At least the Willamette valley Pinot Noir was excellent.\n\nMy wife had one of the worst crab cakes that she has ever had to go along a very boring salad.\n\nWe won't be back."
1,"Awesome environment! I personally LOVE buffets, but I also love the fine dining industry. Via Brazil was the perfect mix of the two and would have to rank one of my favorite restaurant experiences of 2014! With over 20 different varieties of meat, waiters walk around the restaurant with different selections in hand and gracefully offer to cut off a piece of your likings as many times as you please! There are no menus to make it simple, the salad bar has a great variety of salads, pastas, fruits, cheeses and condiments.  You are given three sides to go with your unlimited fancy of meat, and salad bar choices. So much fun, the employees are great as everyone has a welcoming attitude. If your looking for a new kind of dinning experience, this is the place to be, in the heart of Summerlin!"
1,Drinks were very affordable. Conveniently located on Fremont near all the casinos. We got here a little too late so the DJ had finished playing. LAME! We did order drinks and prices were cheap. Clean bathrooms even at the end of the night. Reminded me a lot of LA's Griffin except a lot smaller.
0,I got the Oregon Trail and Tater Tots.  Not impressed.  Flavorless Bison Burger.  Mushy Bun.  Overwhelmed by the garlic in the aioli.  And expensive.  Not worth the money or time.
0,"No good!!!!!! $35 per person and the food is just not so good and wine is not included.  I recommend M buffet at M resort ,much better for the quality, variety and  price. The M resort buffet includes wine, latte and much better variety and quality!!!!! You wont be disappointed at the M buffet!"
0,Poor service. Waited too long for waitress ( Kim) to take our order.  not happy. Will very likely eat somewhere else next time.
1,"I was excited when this place opened and was pleased from the minute I walked in. It's  small, but modern and it's fun to sit at the counter and watch the desserts being plated and sugar being blown. If you are looking for over the top sweet decadent desserts, this is not your place. The desserts here are Japanese style and are delicate, light and not overly sweet. I had the Mt. Fuji which is really the Mont Blanc which you find all over Japan. I think I could've eaten 5 of those."
1,"A favorite & a must whenever we are in Las Vegas. Everything is delicious... appetizers, salad, prime rib (medium rare English cut), mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, creamed corn, sizzling mushrooms, etc. Mmmmm so yummy."
0,"This is based on the Buffet alone\n\nDon't let the extravagance and massive size of Caesar's Palace\ndistract you from how freaking horrible their buffet was.\nI'm not sure if this rule works but when you go to a buffet for dinner in\nLas Vegas and no one is in line for it, I'm thinking it is a first warning.\n\nThe eating area looks nice enough, but when you see the spread\nit is just awful, at no point should you pay $25+ for a buffet\nand you're able to be at one end of the buffet and you can see the other\nend of it, the buffet was THAT short. It was just unimpressive.\nI don't know about you, but when I go to a buffet, i like SELECTION.\nThank goodness they had snow crab legs because if they hadn't\ni would've FLIPPED, so of course i tried to get my meal's worth.\n\nThe food in general was just unappetizing for my eyes and my stomach.\nAvoid the buffet at all costs."
1,"Came here on a whim with the bf for a late night drink and snack and was really impressed by the ambiance of Grit and Grace. The stand-out, spectacular dish of the night was the eggplant marinated in miso. Seriously, this dish blew me away, because the texture of the eggplant is like sashimi in an amazing, original way. Great dish for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. We enjoyed the dim sum as well, but it seemed a little bit less fresh and inspired (maybe because it was around 9 at night), although the kimchi was so tasty. My biggest gripe is with the cocktails, because at $10 a pop they were very light on the booze. I recommend ordering a reliable classic off the menu for a better bang for your buck."
0,"Went here for a girls' night once. There wasn't anything particularly bad about the place (it's cute), and the service is on par. But the general consensus at the end of the night was a 'meh' all around. There was nothing that stood out for us enough to warrant the price of the menu. I honestly can't even remember what I ate there, aside that the meat was on the dry side."
0,Unfortunately Postrio has taken a turn for the worse. We ordered a tuna tartare appetizer which was decent. \n\nMy girlfriends gnocchi was decent but the lobster in my lobster club was rotten. My girlfriend needed to pick up some immodium after our visit and almost vomited while in the restaurant. Postrio is down for the count!! What happened!? This used to be a regular stop for us. NO MORE!!
0,"Disappointing! Turned away without even trying after driving 25 minutes to try for the 1st time. It's 9:15, sign says close at 10p. \""We decided to close early today\"" #FalseAdvertising"
1,"I really enjoy smaller more intimate Elite events such as this one because I really get a chance to truly talk, mingle and meet new people. There was ample seating for all, although our reserved Bar Section was packed it didn't feel crowded. Upon arrival everyone was given two coins to try the new Bar drinks; I had the Sauza Gold Coast Rita and the Aussie Rum Punch, YUM! Both drinks were excellent but the Rita edge out the Punch by a slight hair. The main focus of the event was to try the new appetizers which most can be purchased at about $4 once the new menu rolls out. I must admit I wasn't particularly blown away by any of the appetizers they were all just \""okay\"". My favorite of the appetizers were the Coconut Shrimp, they were perfectly fried yet still were moist and had that distinct shrimp flavor which is normally zapped out in the frying process. The most disappointing appetizer of the night were the flatbreads, although the toppings were good the flatbread itself fell short to me, it reminded me more of a cracker than an actual bread. Luckily, the drinks alone are worth coming back for Happy Hour. Once again another successful Elite Event is in the books! Great job Lindsey and a big thank you to the Outback Steakhouse management and staff!"
1,"I stopped in to Quality Car Stereo completely unplanned but have been in the market for a new stereo for my SUV.  I have been to some of the local competition and $1 install shops and thought I would stop by to check out the selection on pricing.  Chase greeted me upon entrance and I told him what I needed.  Chase was very informative and I could immediately tell he knew his stuff.  Additionally, I knew I wasn't going to break the register with my budget minding purchase and was impressed that I wasn't made to feel like 'i needed to spend more or that 'I was wasting his time which is how I have felt elsewhere.  I was very pleased with the service, selection, and pricing and made my decision to purchase immediately because it is obvious that this local business knows how to treat their customers and is interested in doing business the right way!  Not only will Chase and Mike get my business, they will also get very positive feedback to anybody in the market for car stereo equipment from this customer!"
0,"I'd heard great things, decided to take my mom and sister for dinner before taking them to the airport. Booked through OpenTable for 8:30 August 9th, and got there 8:25pm.  Waited a min or two and we were seated in an area that had prob a party of 16, so our table was by itself at the other end. Which we thought would make it nice and quiet.\n\nWaited a good bit to order bottled water. We had to ask the girl that wasn't our server to send our server by, we had plenty of time to decide on our order as we waited. I order the reg filet medium and my mom and sister both got the petite filet medium well. Also a few sides. Honestly I thought the prices were great, not the typical bloated a la carte prices.\n\nThe place had the a/c blasted and it got cold, and I'm a guy I love the a/c but was freezing.\n\nWe waited and waited... The large group finally got their food and our server said ours would be out next. Maybe the group put everyone's orders back a while. When it finally got to us it had been 70 minutes from the time of our reservation!!! As the food runner was placing the filets I couldn't tell the difference in the sizes (our server later said the petite is 6oz and the reg is 8oz pretty small in my book) I cut into mine and took a few bites and it was not medium. My mom and sisters were not medium well but theirs looked medium. Our server took her time checking on us and I showed her that mine was not medium which she agreed. She said she would talk to the chef, I said if I can be out quickly I would like a new one. She came back and said the chef told her he could make it butterfly style and have it some in 6 minutes. I said fine. \n\nInterestingly I went out with some friends a while back and we made fun of one of the guys for ordering a filet butterfly style.\n\nThe filet came out and it was fine. I enjoyed it, just not the hassle. Then we were thinking of getting desserts but again waited quite a while and finally asked the other girl again and she brought the menus. Our server finally came out and we said if they dessert was quick we could do it, again we were going straight the the airport from here. It came out and it was good as well.\n\nAnyway she comp'd the dessert (of course that was the least I would expect). Total was $126 and I still tipped $20 even though I honestly shouldn't have. If I had the time I would've asked for the manager. Figured I'd email the manager later when I have time. Guess what no email or direct contact info!\n\nSince I recently moved from Summerlin to Mtn's Edge I was thinking this would be a new regular steakhouse for my wife and I, prob not!"
1,"Stopped in while on road trip. The latte I had was a perfect pickup for my long drive, so delicious!  The staff is also very friendly. They have a  gift shop that I hope to spend more time in when I pass thru again."
1,Great food at affordable prices.
1,"The steaks are excellent and the staff was very helpful.  I came here after a long walk down the strip on a Friday night around 6pm and there were still a lot of available seating.  My friend had a rib-eye and it was so delicious!  The New York sirloin was so tender and juicy!  A wonderful atmosphere in the middle of the casino.  The dim lights and layout was really classy.  An excellent place to have a cup of wine and some good cocktails.  It's a little pricey given that it's in the casino.  Overall, an excellent place to go and I'll definitely be back at Brand next time with more friends."
1,"My wife is a native Pittsburgher and we go up couple times a year.  Have never been to any of the chain stores, only the original.  I honestly can't imagine they can match the originality of the store on the Strip.  We always seem to get the same waitress from Lithuania, I think, and she always remembers us even though we are not regulars.\nNothing like a Primanti Bros. sangwich and an IC.  Dang, wish I was there now!!!"
0,"The worst!  35 minutes just to leave the damn airport!  Bad product, bad attitude, stay away."
1,Authentic fresh delicious. Don't waste your time at other places this is it. This is must try it will become one of your favorites.
0,"Not my kind of place. The food is wayyy too weird and taste even weirder. I sat at the bar. I had already told the female bartender that I don't drink. What does that fool do? She serves / gives me a drink! WTH? Are you kidding me? I just told you I don't drink. I think she was trying to get me to loosen up but I was fine until she did that - that pissed me off. I was polite to the little girl who should have known better. I left early only cuz I was not feeling this place, I preferred other sushi places. I most likely will never be back."
1,"Best sushi with the best happy hour price.  I seriously get disappointed at least once during a sushi meal... not tonight,  not here.  Every roll and app not only came out lightening fast,  but tasted THE BEST!!!  And for the price... it was an amazing meal and we will be back."
0,"What a huge disappointment. Was really in the mood. First the guy gets the order wrong and is slow to correct the mistake. I order grilled chicken. Seems  simple.\nI have never seen or tasted chicken that looked more like sundries dog turds.\nDry, causing me to choke. You can tell I am loving this place. The man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order. The girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless. Sound good? Took two bites and left. Wondered why I took a second bite.\nSick. They could have cared less. Oh the rice was mushy. Slice of cucumber"
0,"I recently was contacted by the proprietors of Jimmy's of Chicago and here is the content of their response to my post. Fair and balanced reporting is what I'm all about so I'm giving them a voice. I have to say that their willingness to address the issue and ask for another chance at my business is admirable and we might just check them out again soon. I'll keep you all posted as to my experiences there. Here is their response in its entirety:\n\nDear Mr. Shields,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your dinner here at our restaurant.  I wish you would have shared your concerns with us while you were here as it is of utmost importance to us that all of our guests have a wonderful experience.  We recieve many compliments on our veal dishes and especially on the lasagna.  In fact, the lasagna is one of our best sellers.  Obviously, people have different tastes and perhaps the items you chose are not made in the fashion to which you are accustomed.  We would love you to give us another chance as I think your experience would be much different.  If you are willing to do so, please introduce yourself to either me (Kerry) or my wife (Zalena). We have many regulars who come several times a week and we hope that you and your wife might become one of those.  If not, thank you for your past patronage.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nKerry and Zalena Kersting"
0,"Awful.  They look clean and competent - but every time I go there (and this is my last) - the car seems actually dirtier than when I arrived!  How is this possible?  Well, after they hand it back to me, there are crumbs etc on the seats (sloppy vacuuming) the  cupholders and console still has stains - I  mean OBVIOUS stuff.  There wasn't a visit where I had too send them back 2-3 times to re-vacuume  or re-wipe the inside.  I am no clean freak by any means,  This was just sloppy work,  Consistently."
0,"I ate here way back then and truly will never go back....for one, the last time I went there I ordered a cheese pizza with bacon(no problem) as I was sitting there waiting and watching everyone else get their orders and being served I started to wonder...what the hell is going on?45 minutes and the pizza wasnt even ready yet???I told the guy at the counter and I said forget it...he returned my money and I just left that place...I really don't have the time for idiots or 3 hour waits for a friggin pizza that i can truly make way better homemade than they ever can.its true."
0,"Pros\nI didn't get sick!!\n\nCons\nThe \""Food\""\n\nWhile in Las Vegas my wife, 10 month old daughter, and I decided to try the Rainforest Cafe located in the MGM Grand. We all enjoyed the decor, the service was so so, but the food was absolutely disgusting. We started things off with 2 waters and a diet coke and ordered the \""Awesome Appetizer\"". All the food on the platter (2 chix strips, 2 chimmi cha cha's ,crab dip, and calamari) was cold except the crab dip which was piping hot. One thing I don't understand is the chix strips and calamari where both very lightly cooked almost underdone but the chimi cha cha (similar to a chili's southwestern eggroll) was overcooked and really dark. Having worked in a restaurant for a few years I knew this was from using old fry oil that had gone too long without filtration or replacement, it causes a burnt crust with an almost smoky/bitter taste and an undercooked center.\n\nFor our main dishes I had ordered a cobb salad and my wife had the \""Rasta Pasta\"". My salad was also pretty bad, a good portion of the lettuce was wilted. It was also pretty clear that they didn't take the time to dry the lettuce after washing it. The wet lettuce couldn't hold onto the dressing which caused a pool of water/dressing to form in the bottom of my bowl. My wifes pasta wasn't as disgusting, but it wasn't good either. The chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland.\n\nThe total bill for our meal came to just over $70 which is way to much for the quality of the food. After 11 nights in Las Vegas this is by far the worst place we ate at, I have no idea why the MGM Grand would allow the restaurant in it's casino.  It's a shame I have to give this place even one star which is one more than it deserves."
0,Went to manny's for Cinco de Mayo. Big mistake! This is not authentic Mexican food! I ordered there version of albondigas soup. All grease. No vegies. Tiny meat balls. Who would serve this to anyone. There version of tamales are frozen heated  in the microwave. This is not fresh homemade food. Unfortunately for them not going here again. Should of went to Garcias.
0,"I usually don't even bother writing restaurant reviews.  However, our recent visit to Captain Bill's for brunch was so bad that I actually want to write about my disappointing experience.\n\nWhen we were led to our table, we heard a couple at a nearby table complain nobody had come to wait on them a long time after they had been seated.  Bad sign.  \n\nWe placed the order and sat there for an eternity.  I don't know what was going on that day, but why did it take 45 minutes to cook eggs benedict when the restaurant was half empty?  We complained to the waiter after a long wait.  So he brought us the side steak fries and the clam chowder (which must have been pre-made in batch anyways).  Then after another LONG wait, our eggs benedict came.  The manager never stopped by to explain or apologize like the waiter had told us, either.\n\nThe food was a joke.  Our side order of steak fries was 6 or 7 pieces of fries sharing a small saucer with some ketchup.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Was this a miniature dish?  The fries were pale rather than golden colored.   McDonald's has more exciting fries.  Their famous \""clam chowder\"" would have tasted good if it had not been so outrageously salted.  In fact, it was so salty it reminded me of the Campbell concentrated canned soups.   There was no bread or cracker to help with the saltiness of the soup.  The crab cakes had a good texture with chunks of crab meat.  However, it tasted like worcestershire sauce rather than seafood.  The poached eggs were small and flat they looked like over easy fried eggs with trimmed edges.   The benedict dish had about 14 steak fries on it as a side. Why was this double the amount of fries we had received in a separate order of side steak fries?  I don't know."

0,"I went through Expedia to book this hotel. From the website, it seemed so appealing with the amenities that they had to offer including a kitchenette, free shuttle service and a pool.\n\nWell, they all had that stuff...but with a few caveats. The kitchenette from the website included a full size refrigerator. Mine only had a mini-fridge. And as for the free shuttle service, well they only leave once an hour, on the hour to the strip. And as for the pool, it's big enough for old people who booked this hotel/time share.\n\nThe rooms were located in an outside environment, so as soon as you walked out of the hallway, you're experiencing outside weather. If it's hot outside, it's also hot in the hallways.\n\nThe air conditioning does provide solace inside the rooms. But only when it was on, since it kept cycling on-off throughout my stay there.\n\nThere is a \""resort-tax,\"" but I guess that's a standard in Vegas, so don't be surprised when you have to pay a little more when you check-in.\n\nHousekeeping service was not offered to us since we only stayed for 2 nights. That was made clear to us when we checked. I guess that's ok?!?\n\nThey do have free coffee and bagels in the mornings.\n\nBut other than that, I would spend a few dollars more and just stay on the Strip next time."
0,"Ok, so we had been trying to get to this restraunt for a few months. We decided to go last night for my fiancee's birthday, and was that the biggest mistake we ever made? Yes. The night started off with ham and pimento cheese sliders which were so salty, I must have gone through 2 waters and an unsweet tea just to wash the taste out of my mouth. The barbacue sauce on the frenched chicken drummette's was waaaaaay to sweet and overpowered by the amount of ketchup and sugar they must have made it with. For dinner, the fried southern chicken came with green beans that had absolutely NO seasoning, mashed potatoes that were too salty, and gravy on the chicken that was salty. The filet came with a sauce on it that tasted like sh*t. I mean, there was no other way to describe it, and when I'm spending $25 on an 8oz filet, I at least want to be able to eat it. I mean, it was so disgusting. The sauteed mushrooms, I actually had to put salt and pepper on them. I have NEVER EVER done that at a restraunt. It's like they don't season half the food and overseason the other half. No balance anywhere. The dessert wasn't as bad, but how can you mess up a cookie? Especially one that Cracker Barrel also has but their's is way bigger and costs $5 less. The red velvet bread pudding wasn't that bad but it was way too thick and pastey. It was the WORST experience I have ever had with food at a restraunt. They need Gordan Ramsey so bad, wow. DO NOT EAT HERE. I'm paying for it today. O, and the waiter was so awkward, just kind of hovering around our table. Really strange."
1,Hired them through hire a helper to unload my moving truck after relocating from Houston.  They were on time very polite and did a fabulous  and fast job.  Thank you so much
0,"My son plays in a youth hockey league here and has for over three years.. New owners took over and it has gone from ok to worse.. The kids play at the South Pole where there is no \""real\"" bleacher seating to watch the teams play. Nevermind that it is freezing in there.. The travel team practices in the North Pole where no one is really paying attention to them.. But I guess when you pay $3000 vs $800 it apparently doesn't matter. Or so the owner told an upset parent.. The games are late.. 8:00. On school nights and there is no consideration because they pay less to pay.. Let's see how much money is lost when parents don't sign there kids up next year for this sub-par excuse for a league.. Who suffers the most? The kids..."
0,"I must say 8 out 10 people that it seen working the on the lower floor where great. Two men where to busy doing something else to even give a crap what you needed or help you with finding an item on there computer to locate, all I got was go there make a left to the computer department they will help... In a rude way, not nice. The top floor I did not see one worker the entire time. Hard to purchase a bedroom set with know one to answer your questions. The items that are listed in stock are not.  They need more workers I was there with my sister and mom who was in a wheel chair, you try and walk a cart a wheel chair and two furniture carts with two people, no help down the isles to help a lady load a bedroom set. Horrible... I was asked after I paid if I needed help and said no since I was not helped much my entire time at the store. Working for a large department store back in high school I get it. They need more workers maybe union works that can stand around and just answer questions and help or seniors like they have at walmart! my sister said this was her first and last time going to ikea. Out of six furniture pieces only 3 where in stock sad no free delivery on the items or something like sorry we don't have it only it will be in stock tomorrow. You feel like an animal in a line to pay and leave.\n\nMaybe if another location closer is built I'd go again, but other than that I'm going to do online shopping and purchase what they did not have in stock. This will be much less stressful and you can call and ask someone questions about a product."
0,"Crowded...jammed....packed...?  Must have been in the good ole days.  Went on a Saturday at 12:45 and the place was 25% full.\n\nWell, maybe that because the corporate recipe chef left out spices, herbs, butter, flavor buds, real food, salt and pepper, etc.  In nother words - no flavor folks!\n\nGave em a 2 since they serve Coke instead of Pepsi.  The cookie gal walked right by us...that almost got them a 1, but I figured the cookies were probably bland, too."
1,"This is hands down my new fav buffet place in Vegas. I never thought I'd find another buffet that impress me more than Bellagio's, but boy am I wrong.\n\nGo early, or you'd have to wait in a crazy long line. They shuck oysters in front of you and these are the freshest oysters ever, and that my friend, says a lot. \n\nThey have a wide selection of delicious food from all around the world. My fav were the oysters and Kobe sliders. Oh yum yum yum!!!"
1,"La Distillerie has a great atmosphere and crowd for your 20-something's who like to get their hipster drank on.  From the cool and attractive waitstaff to the unique and inspiring cocktails, La Distillerie is sure to give you and your friends plenty to talk about when you get there. \n\nThe menu has Le Freshest Design with a simple and informational style that not only explains the alcohol content level of each drink, but also the categorical flavor cohort that it can be shoved into.  From sweet and acidic to herbal, there are both classic and modern favors for you to choose from. \n\nThe only con that I had here was the time it took both to get the attention of a waiter and to finally get the drink I ordered. Other than that I loved it. Will definitely being going back to try more~~\n\nOn a side note there was one particular guy waiter who was hot-as-fux with some of the most lick-able eyebrows I have ever seen....and let's not forget about that female bartender with blonde dreads who double fisted those drink mixers and pounded that ice with that hammer like she was Thor. That definitely had me feelin some type of way."

1,"I've seen many of the magic shows in Las Vegas, and Jan Rouven is absolutely among the best..  This is a must-see show.    It is very entertaining, and the theater is not too large so everyone has a good seat.\n\nThe venue for the show is the Clarion hotel -- it is just off the strip near the north end.  The Clarion describes itself as a hotel/casino, but the casino only has slot machines.   \n\nThe show is targeted at adults, but there is no \""adult\"" content - so it is safe to bring your kids and they won't be bored.  It is not, however, a \""family-centric\"" magic show like some of the afternoon shows at other venues.\n\nI give this two thumbs up."
0,This subway has terrible service. The food is just ok and the space is not well kept.
1,"This is a great place.  I have been here a few times and have tried different items and everytime, it has been great.  \n\nThe portions are a great size and guess what???  They give a military discount here.  So far I have not had any complaints about the food, or the service.  I have also never heard any complaints from anyone I have been here with.\n\nSo if you are hungry for good food from breakfast to 3:30pm, this is the place to go.  I would definitely recommend you try this place if you are in the area, you will not be disappointed.\n\nLastly, our server was Jaclyn and she was AWESOME...if you go and can get her table, you will have some GREAT service and she will keep you happy."
0,"I stayed here Labor Day weekend 2013 and had so many problems from  being given a room that was occupied , locked out of my room, no maid service, double charged on two credit cards and told that I had two rooms reserved instead of one. They offered me a free upgrade which I decided to take for the same weekend this year, Just four days before I am to leave I just got a call rescinding the same offer that they offered and set up. \n\nI was offered food and beverage comps that do me no good unless I cancel other reservations. They also offered to pick me up at the airport and that does nothing for me as a friend I am meeting is picking me up. I don't think a hotel could do any worse than last year but they topped it by ruining my vacation two years in a row. \n\nMy past stays had been good but they wiped out years of good stays with these two and I think it is time for me to stay where my business is appreciated. I would never recommend staying here to anyone for fear they might get the same treatment."
1,"My recommendation: \""Mango A-Go-Go\"" and the \""Sweet Street Waffle\""\n\nThe absolute best thing you can order at Jamba Juice is ironically not a juice, or a smoothie. The Sweet Street Waffles are a godsend. I suggest getting them toasted and possibly get two. They're so good, it's hard to just have one. \n\nThe smoothies there are very good. They try to stay away from adding sugars or syrups, although most of their juices are still made from concentrates.\n \nOn a side note, if you are a super health nut, Jamba Juice's wheatgrass seems to taste sweeter than other smoothie places that sell it. I've had \""bitter\"" tasting grass from other smoothie chains which make taking wheatgrass (which has a hard-to-bear taste already) even more of a chore, whereas Jamba's  wheatgrass is a tad bit easier to \""swallow\""."

0,I'm a graduate of this school and I have been trying for over a week to get my transcripts...the customer service is allot to be said for. No one returns my calls. No one knows where my paper work is. They expect you to slap down your credit card number on a fax form in order to get someone when ever they feel like it to finally send the fax but you have your info vulnerable for everyone to see. I called to make sure they got my fax.. No one called me back had to call again finally got thru. Carla was what I would call unorganized to say the least. Rude is also a good word to describe her conversation with me and she acted like it put her put to talk to me. She said she never got the fax. Lie!...i asked her to look again i have the confirmation from my fax machine it went thru. She finds it on her desk so she wasn't even sure she even had it and they want me to leave my cc number on that form...no. She Says its not filled out proper. I said yes it is i just won't put my cc info out on paper for just anyone to see. She said some one would call me no one has and i call to speak to the director which you have to leave voice message for Cuz he's busy and i get transferred only to be hung up on. Who the hell runs this school? I realize it is not in your best interest to see me go somewhere else to further my massage career but maybe just maybe if your school were more responsible I would of stayed there.
0,I was so very disappointed!!!  This is not even close to the Al's Beef on Taylor street.  The beef tastes old and the fries are limp and soggy.  The decor is nice but no counter space to put your tray while you get ketchup.  Not that I will ever be coming back!
0,"My co-workers raved about the food so I went. \n\nThat being said, the guy in front of me had been waiting for 30 minutes for a gyro (he left FURIOUS) so I did an order of lentil soup to go so I could get my food quickly (to avoid driving to another place).  The place wasn't busy.  25 minutes later, I had my soup to go ($5) and it was in a 10oz container not all the way full....more like a cup of soup. \n\nI got back to my desk and it wasn't even lentil soup......the soup tasted like lemonade with salt.  \n\nNo \""I'm sorry\"" or anything for the wait...I won't be returning."
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised! We were regulars at Agave (which occupied the space previously) and the look was relatively the same, with some nice updates - reupholstered booths, cool lanterns hanging inside and over the patio.\n\nThe highlights were the Mexican street corn and the poblano cornbread. So good! My husband had the shrimp fajitas. Although it was more like a paella with tortillas, it was awesome! I had the chicken fajitas and it was also good (not as good as the shrimp) but it was cooked in a red sauce, and wasn't like a traditional fajita. We also had the house made guacamole and that was pretty good as well.\n\nWe were there on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy (maybe 1/4 full) and service was excellent. Looking forward to going back!"
0,"We used to go to blu for good sushi. But the good sushi comes at a price, lackluster service, long waits, and higher prices. Decided after last time not a place to hit before a movie (you won't make the movie) nor on date night (the babysitter ends up costing more due to the fact that your night just got twice as long).  Even when I stopped by to buy a gift card it took almost half an hour, seriously wow!  A couple hours of waiting at this place that I will never get back."
1,Great service. Will put you in agreat mood.
1,He and my girlfriend came over tonight to have some fettucini alfredo and we just ordered the two small one would have been plenty our server Luis was very nice and courteous we will return.
1,"Oh, dear turkey sandwich made out of identifiable turkey and not pressed lunch meat, I love you.\n\nI am a big fan of sandwiches. I remember seeing Capriotti's on the Food Network, and was pumped to find out they were opening a Madison location. Capriotti's thing is giant sandwiches (a small is 9\"") and focusing on pulled turkey. \n\nWe ordered a few different things, and I sampled the roast beef sandwich on a kaiser roll with cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and seasoning, and their signature, The Bobbie - aka Thanksgiving on a roll.\n\nI really liked the roast beef. Also pulled, it reminds me of the oh-so-tasty pot roast sandwich that only homemade leftovers have provided me with up until this point. \n\nThe Bobbie was also good, but I think for me it'd be a once or twice a year thing. The turkey was tasty, the stuffing absolutely delish, and cranberries very sweet. If the cranberries fell more on the tart side than the gooey, sweet side, I'd maybe be obsessed - which is a surprise because for the most part I am all sorts of against mixing up my food. My dad always says, \""It's all going to the same place,\"" but I've always been closer to the \""my corn can't touch my mashed potatoes\"" end of things.\n\nAnyway, the point is that for $7 you can get a giant sandwich featuring home-cooked-style meat and crunchy veggies. Definitely a step above Subway, Silver Mine, and *barf* Cousins."
0,"the beds were comfy , On the other hand there were several issues.   Upon arrival we were placed in a regular room in error. 90 min later we get placed in 2919 o n the biz class floor as you indicated in our conversations.   THe room wasnt having the WOW 4 star 250 a night power I was expecting so i calle d to front desk because I thought the manager mentioned the other options as in the jr suite with the seperate areas. The rep told us it would be another 150 to get that room was originally offered.   Tic toc time was wasting so I said its ok we want to go out. I requested some bath robes and was told they'd be right up. 45 min later we left, when we returned they were ther, but 2.5 hours of working with staff was displeasing.  Later that evening i shocked myself on a lamp with exposed wiring where the switch was near the barre wire. I burned my finger. I tried to call down but the phone next to the bed was broken, it is crossed with another line. So i am running cold water over it in the bathroom and the phone in there was broken too. We had dinner reservations so I just left to make them.  Later , when we returned we found the room to be very cold. I tried to adjust the heat but the thermostat was broken and repaired with some tape. After 3 hours of playing with it it sorta was comfortable temp. I was going to complain but by now it was late and we needed to sleep.We were cold and too hot all night.   Now I didnt need to complain more, ...and our limited time in the city needed to be spent on fun not negative complaints.  On saturday night I wasnt well and needed a bottle of water and a snack , I saw there were vending machineS somewhere on their site , so I call front desk to ask where it is. I am informed they are on the 28th floor.I got dressed and there was ONE broken pop machine. I called front desk from the hall and the same person told me that it was broken and the only one. Whay a 4 star with just a pop machine??? Ive been to 2 stars with several snack and drink machines and it was a fraction of dupris size. sending me to a broken drink machine WOW  I was all good with this....live and let live right? I didnt want to be rude and complain about the free upgrade but the sight of the mold in the tub sunday am was what really really made me irate. Mold in a 4 star, not a good review online now is it.  I have HIV , mold is super super bad"
1,"If you ever come here you must sit outside and enjoy the poolside view, even if its a little hot, you wont reget it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came for lunch after checking into encore. We ordered the organix mix salad, and beef sliders, truffle fries.\n The food was delicious. If you get the salad, there is no need to add meat, because honestly they dont give you that much for the extra price and the salad itself is savory. \n\nThe sliders were good, typical sliders nothing really special about them, I guess you're better off ordering a burger for the same price as the sliders.\n\nOMGOSH the truffle fries were SO GOOd!!! Definitely would order these again! There were freshly made a d had truffle sauce and cheese over it. So bad for you but ooooo so good.\n\nOver all the prices seemed a little steep, but it is vegas so what do you expect. The serve was good, they seemed really busy but they were attentive."
0,"I finally dined here for the first time last night and I have been meaning to come for 8 years but never managed to justify the long wait.  However, yesterday we were at the Science Center and it was early enough to not have too long of a wait, if you can say that 1.5 hours is not too long.  We grabbed a few glasses of wine at the Blanco Bar next door and settled in for our wait.  What a cute place, old rustic European country decorum in a renovated house from the 20's.  Very charming and pleasant however the wait staff...not so much.  Very odd thing here, as the staff is not outwardly rude but they are aloof and disinterested in their customers, at least from what we observed.  I had to go and ask someone for a menu and the girl who was waiting in our section had come by several times to fill water and get things for her other customers sitting right next to us.\n\nWe were finally seated and I guess I didn't specify that since we were waiting all that time that we wanted a table, as we ended up sitting at the bar, which sort of sucked.  It is a cramped situation with no real place to put your feet and I kept hitting my knees on the front of the bar.  My feet went to sleep several times from tucking them on the rung of my chair as that was the only place for them to go.  I kept bumping into my poor neighbor while I was trying to eat since her back was turned towards me.  I think she must have figured out by sitting that way she could put her feet on her friend's chair rung too, more options!  In short, I felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland after she had eaten the cake that made her grow so large.\n\nFinally the food came and I totally agree with Gabriel's review.  Very, very fresh ingredients but sorely lacking in seasoning!  We had the Caprice Salad, the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto and the Margherita Pizza.  All of which were made from very fresh high quality ingredients but I found that I was salting everything!  The food was simply too bland.  I do not understand what the hype is all about frankly.  I don't understand why the long wait, outside of the fact that the place is like a friggen dollhouse!  And the waiter behind the bar was arrogant, like everyone who works there.  He could care less about who we were and if anything, I felt like we may have been putting him out a bit.  How dare we order more food and wine!  Christ I needed more wine to deal with the attitude and seating.  And OVER PRICED  for sure.\n\nI think Cibos and the Parlor have much better food and you don't have to wait an eternity to get a table.  In fact, I'm coming to realize that Cibos is the best brick oven pizza in here in the valley.  \n\nAt least I can take this place off my list and to be honest I will not be going back."
1,"After reading some neg. reviews, I feel compelled to review AND give 5 stars. The husband and I set out to find a nice happy hour locale for our weekly date night and were not disappointed with Presidio. Bartender, Chad, was super nice and attentive without being over-bearing, he kept us refreshed and let us order drinks at the happy hour price a few minutes after 7. Atmosphere is nice, and we love the open doors and patio. We haven't tried the food but are returning this evening if that says anything."

0,"First off I made a Yelp account just to review this place.-- HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU PEOPLE EAT THIS? I am utterly shocked that this place has tolerable reviews! Do you people even have taste buds or do you normally just eat trash? I guess compared to dumpster food you might think this place was good. Don't get me wrong the greeter was awesome, great customer service and sociable skills. But it's the food that matters, right? So let's get to it.. The pizza was down right AWFUL. My wife and I felt sick to our stomachs after eating a few slices. It was lunch hour on a Saturday and it was DEAD. 2 people were there and they were well into their 70's. The pizza was cold, cheese was hard, pepperoni's were burnt... We even got a few fresh slices (packed with this cheese that had a weird tint to it) It was a deep dish pepperoni pizza with pineapple.  I took one bite and the rubber martian cheese filled my mouth. It tasted like I was chewing silly putty that someone poured tomato paste from a can on it. Ci Ci's pizza tastes like a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump. We ate what we could tolerate and left within 20 minutes. (because we just spent close to 16 bucks on this crap and couldn't just bail without something) ---- LONG STORY SHORT. We wasted $15 and some change that we could have gone to Ci Ci's or Little Caesars with. Never going again. EVER.  I shiver at the thought of eating there again. Prison food sounds better than this crap."
0,"What an incredible disappointment! Not much more than a month after my wife and I visited this place before a Cardinal's preseason game in which we were told that burgers were not on the menu! What?!!! You're a burger joint. The place was empty and we listened to the excuses that the Fire Marshall had shut the oven down. We decided to stay and eat and were not impressed. We decided to give them another try later when we could actually order a burger. Hold onto your hat!!\n\nWe showed up at 12:30 on Sun, Oct 13 after an early movie at IPic to have drinks and lunch with friends thinking we would enjoy the beautiful weather on the patio and watch the Cardinals play the 49ers in an away game. After ordering our first round of drinks and an appetizer the game was turned off to instead show the Broncos game because the woman behind us was a Broncos fan. Are you *#%\u00a5 kidding me?!!! When I asked our server why he turned off the Cardinals game he said that she was there first and it was policy to turn the TV to what the first person asked. What a joke! I said to the server \""So if I had got here first and wanted to watch the news instead of the Cards game you would have obliged me?\"" He had no response and looked irritated. Well not as irritated as me young man!! I promptly asked for a to go box for our appetizer and reminded him what town we were in and the several hundred dollar tab he just missed out on. Paid my bill and let the rest of our party know that I would be hosting lunch at my home where Arizonans could watch their team play out of town on my big screen. In what parallel universe could you be in another city other than Scottsdale and watch your game be turned off airing your home team? Pathetic!! \nIt just goes to show how poor this ownership and management is that the locals were pushed out to make way for one Denver fan. We will never be back to this place again and after reading the other reviews I'm with the rest of them in asking \""How much longer before this place goes under?\"" \n\nI have half a mind to ask some friends if they'd like to be partners in a restaurant and show these idiots how to run a LOCAL bar and grill. What a waste."
1,By far the best bakery in town!
1,"This is one of those locations that I have walked past the last two years and never got around to trying.  My main attraction to the storefront is the plastic food out front, which just looks so wonderfully Japanese to me.  There is something about shiny plastic food replicas that really peaks my interest.  Also, the amount of corn used on the food also made me think that it was a Japanese franchise.  It is in fact not, but Canadian, and Montreal specific.  The only other two location are at the Six Flags Theme Parks in the province.  \n\nThis is a small cafe with only one worker that does everything, or at least at the times that I visited.  You order at the counter and pay, and then they will call out your order for pick-up.  Seating is limited to about three tables, with an excellent view of the street.  \n\nThey are sold out of many items, like chicken salad and waffles.  However, I ordered the Tuna Salad Crepe and it tasted much better than expected.  The crepe was slightly sweet and crunchy, filled with tuna salad sandwich toppings; tomato, lettuce, corn, sliced processed cheese, and tuna salad.  All of the items here are cheap, keeping most under $5.50 CAD.  \n\nAlso, we ordered a Nutella covered plain crepe, it was perfect.  These are not knife and fork style crepes, instead the hand held version.  Most of the toppings are made in house.  I watched the cook slicing the fresh strawberries before assembling them for the previous customer.  Next time, I will get that chicken salad with curry topping."
1,"Fogo De Chao is a Brazilian Steakhouse, AKA an All-You-Can-Eat Delicious Meat dinner.  They also have the option of just doing the salad bar if you are not a meat eater.\n\nThe sides and salad bar have tons of fresh veggies, imported/gourmet cheeses, cured meats, and various Brazilian style side dishes.  Let's just say there are a ton of great options to start with so definitely start by grabbing a plate here.  \n\nThey have these cards on the table with one side green (go-feed me more) and the other side red (stop-I'm full or need a break).  Flip your card over to green and the chefs start to serve you fresh cuts of meat that are brought to your table and sliced right onto your plate.  Choose from chicken (even bacon wrapped chicken!), beef (at least 3 different kinds), pork, sausage links, and they even have lamb.  When you are satisfied then flip your card back to red.  \n\nI'm always so full that I don't have room for desert but one of these days I'm gonna try the Molten Chocolate Cake!  The table next to us ordered it and I was literally drooling.\n\nI'm getting hungry just writing this review. . . ."
0,"Very pricey...at least compared to normal yogurt places such as Yogurtland. The yogurt itself is very creamy...together. It's actually a bit too creamy for me as I wanted a more yogurt-y feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip. Anyway, this is what I tried:\n\nCheesecake: Definitely reminds me of a sour cream/cream cheese mix, but VERY, very creamy.\n\nTart: I honestly thought you couldn't go too wrong with plain tart, but it was creamy and way too sour. There was really no flavor to it; just creamy sourness...if that's even a flavor.\n\nChocolate: Again, a bit of a disappointment. It did taste better than most of the other yogurts, but it wasn't too satisfying. I guess it's one of those \""I'll eat it if I have to since I'm craving CHOCOLATE AND I NEED IT NOW!!!\"" last resorts.\n\nPistachio: Absolutely no flavor. Just a sweet icy thing. Hideous.\n\nStrawberry: This one was my favorite. It was pretty much the only edible thing there...actually tasted like strawberries and cream. Again, not the best by far, but certainly edible.\n\nOverall, I am definitely still on my search to find a decent yogurt place in Vegas..."
1,"This is one of the nicest and priciest meals I've had on the strip. Started out with a wine selection recommended by the waiter, which was excellent. I ordered the sea bass in miso sauce and I loved it! It's a bit on the saltier side but I love salty so it was perfect for me. It's a good size sea bass. My husband ordered the lobster pot pie. It's pricey but amazing!!! A must try! I love seafood do there were a lot of options. If you're into steaks or anything else, I might try another restaurant. \n\nMy husband and I spilt a root beer float, which comes with warm cookies. Not what you would expect from fine dining but the waiter recommended it and it was good. The cookies were warm and delicious. \n\nThe service was good and the waiter was very knowledgeable. I would recommend this place if you want to try fine dining. It's not very big so I would make a reservation. Enjoy!"
0,"Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting, and then when we finally get seated guess what, it's another hour wait for our pizza.... Could have told us that before the first hour!!! Save yourself the 2 hours of waiting and go to Pizza Hut, you'll be much less dissatisfied. I would give this place zero stars if I could."

0,"Eh, there's definitely plenty of better options in Vegas.  I keep going back and really wanting to like it, but every time I dine here, I'm under-whelmed.\n\nThe food is ok, but way overpriced for what you get.  Definitely not a place to go if you want something flavorful and enticing.\n\nBreakfast is definitely the better time to go.  My favorite thing on their menu is the blood orange mimosa."

1,"Good food, good portions, and a good staff. Defiantly coming back"
0,"We decided to give them a try for dessert before trying them for dinner. The server told us there was not a dessert menu but they had yuzu cheesecake, green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate lava cake, and yuzu sorbet. None of the desserts seemed inspired to me. Especially the chocolate lava cake which is outdated and the green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which is commonly served at Japanese restaurants. \n\nNone of the desserts were well executed. Instead of coming with yuzu cheesecake, the dessert sampler came with black sesame mochi because they ran out of the cheesecake. \n\nI am in no rush to return for dinner because if they cannot execute straight forward desserts I do not feel they can execute straight forward Japanese food."
1,"This not-so-secret pizzeria in the Cosmopolitan is pretty delish!\n\nI suppose it was pretty easy to access this spot considering I was pretty sloshed after Marquee. Its on the 3rd floor near Comme Ca in a hallway...filled with people. So, just follow the crowds =)\n\nWhat I ordered: \n\n- a slice of the NY style white pie! There were chunks of goat cheese and it tasted as though it was drenched with truffle oil (so yumz)\n\nagain, my senses were impaired but the flavors still shined through!"
1,"Place is great. I'm from Hawaii and I miss my Filipino food. This place always hits the spot for me. Always a great number of choices and the workers there are always really friendly. Can't beat the price either! Like $7.99 for AYCE. I usually spend that for one dish at most other places. Whenever I'm in town and have the craving for some Filipino food, I'm sure to stop in here."
0,"I dunno, when you hire people who appear to have never worked in a restaurant and hope their good looks will cover up their service deficiencies, you most likely are on a path to ruin.  The food sounded like it would be good but we don't know.  We checked in at the greeting stand and were told the wait would be 5 - 10 minutes.  We said were going to get a couple Bloody Mary's.  We sat at the bar waiting to order for 20 minutes. - one of the bartenders gave us a glass of water and walked away.  Maybe she pitied our thirst.  We noticed several customers waiting like us only a little more frustrated.  I went back to the greeting stand and the woman told me she thought I left but immediately sat us.  We sat by the kitchen and watched the chef freaking out on the wait staff and seeming very stressed out.  We waited about 7 minutes until a waitress came by and said, \""Sorry you've waited so long; I will right with you.\"". She could have taken our drink orders then but she did not.  We continued to wait 8 more minutes watching the panicked, stressed out chef and waitresses and then decided to leave.  Cute waitresses, cool design crappy, non-existent service."
1,"I literally found Gemtime at the perfect moment. I was leaving Dunkin Donuts and just happened to look over and saw this little shop tucked away in the corner. The irony was that I had been carrying these two watches in the car for months that needed to be repaired. I had found a coupon for this place in the mall; but for some reason, I hadn't gone yet. \n\nWhen I arrived in the shop, John had me pick out a band I liked and cut it to fit the watch. I actually like my watch better then before and wear it more often!  Had I not found Gemtime, I  would've had to ship the watch out to Kenneth Cole and go thru this long drawn out progress. Then, he held on to the other watch until he found the exact shade of red in patent leather to match.  Mind you, I searched for months online and went to several watch repair shops to find a match. He's really good and all of that work for a really great price.  Plus he's a really nice guy with a great rapport with his customers!  Thank you John for bringing my watches back to life!  :-)"
1,I heart Defalcos. The sandwhiches are always good and yesterday I had a bite of a friends pasta and it was delish.  I have also purchased things from the store and they are always amazing. Four stars only because sometimes the wait is ridiculous.
0,"Well, what can I say.  Wow!  This was the WORST restaurant experience that I have had in my 43 years on this earth.  I am not exaggerating.  It was very, very painful.\n\nIt started with the hostess.  A \""5-10\"" minute wait was all, she said.  25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names.  OK, no problem, mistakes happen, we understand.  She says we get the next 2 person table.  Cool.  As we are waiting, I notice a couple being seated that came in much after us.  After some questioning, she allegedly crossed out their names too.  Umm, really???  The girl had no clue.\n\nFinally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient.  OK, we are patient.  We order our food, a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich.  As we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting, we hear the waitress scolding customers.....\""I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer, you chose to wait.  Really????   At another table she says the same thing.  The table next to us, once they get their food, complain and leave without even touching it.  Oh my!!!!\n\nApparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd.  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above, took 70 minutes to get to us.....YES! 70 MINUTES!!!!!!!!  I can't believe we waited that long.  We were so mad, but at some point we were too invested.\n\nOnce the food comes.....no chips.  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet.  Really!!!!?????\n\nThe food was decent, no complaints there.  Every single table, though, was mad and upset about the wait.  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and I eat out A LOT!\n\nAnyway, stay away from this place.  They don't deserve your business.  This, by the way, is also the first \""bad\"" review I have ever written.. They should be ashamed!"
1,I went here with my friend cuz he tried before~. Love the food here~ the coconut dessert is my favor~ the BEEF RENDANG and ROTI CANAI taste so good!!! The restaurant is clean which is good!  I will coming back and try something else next time!
1,"Crazy menu, but it works.  Everyone is very friendly greeting you when you arrive and when you leave.  Food was delivered quick and best of all was the Charlie Brown Shake (Nutella and Banana). \n\nAs Arnold says, \""I'LL BE BACK!!!\"""
1,"who's ready to parrrtayyy! my girls and I had sooooo much fun! i wish we could have stayed longer, but our feet just would not allow. Different rooms with different music. If you just want to dance your heart out stop on by.. try and pre-game because drinks are an arm and a leg. Thank god we made friends with a promoter, who 1. got us in free and skipped the line, and 2. gave us each a drink voucher, or else we would have had to pay 26 bones for a shot of patron! *gasps*...i know! terrifying!. but all in all a must stop when in town!"
0,"This place, you'd think, would be a quick and easy lunch spot, but between placing our order and receiving our food, caterpillars turned to butterflies... The staff was very much not cut out to be in the service industry. Zero personality at the register. Once we did get our food, it was so salty, it couldn't be finished."
0,Are you joking me? Never go here $20 car wash! I've had my car washed better at a drive thru self wash. There was no full service here just a full service rip off.

0,"I'm an avid shopper at Ulta. Every time I've come in here to look, etc. employees are rude and on top of me the entire time. The reason it deserves one star is because I was here before Christmas a few years ago with my mom (shopping for my daughter) and I had a police man usher me and two other women to the back of the store. They made us empty our pockets, purses, etc. and we're extremely rude to all of us. They accused us all of being in cahoots with each other and planning to shoplift... I'd never even seen the women before! I was shaken up and very upset. But still very polite to manager and said I understood she was just looking out for the store and she was unbelievably rude and brushed me aside instead apologizing greatly, as she should have. Little did she know I was probably going to spend 100$+ on Christmas gifts! Very unfortunate because two or three of the girls here are angels and amazing helpers."
1,"This is it. This is without a doubt in my mind and my wife's, the number one restaurant in Pittsburgh.\nEverything about this restaurant is outstanding-  the ambiance is very sophisticated and  wonderful, the service is educated, informed, efficient, unobtrusive and helpful.\nWe have dinned here numerous times for business and for pleasure. We have had outstanding lamb, veal, pastas and seafood. \nChef Stevens never disappoints and when we get the tasting menu and often we do it with the wine pairing it is a dining adventure. Sometimes we ask the chef to add an extra course to the tasting menu and he always obliges with something superb.\n I should mention that the deserts are amazing.\nThe experience is EXCITING AND WONDERFUL."
1,"After leaving the restaurant, I was pretty dead-set on giving this place a three-star rating.  But as the days passed, Mily & Lalo was on my mind...\n\nI can hear a faint whisper in the air: mi mi mi, ly ly ly... la la la, lo lo lo.  That's when the mescaline was in full effect.  But I had to have it... you see, I was craving the bread.  That delicious world-rockin' yucca bread.  It tastes like a donut.at.its.m-fing.core.  So good.  When you take a bite of it (and dip a piece in the spicy ambrosia-esque sauce), you'll know what I'm talking about.  Some say exaggeratiion reeks of sarcasm, this, my friends - the bread - smells of the truth.  Abandon religion - find the bread.\n\nCeviche's okay.\n\ndmo out"
0,"Not sure how this place is getting the reviews it does. We lived in Los Angeles for seven years and ate all kinds of Middle Eastern food all over the city. This place is terrible. We got a few apps- the falafel and the kibbeh were the only things decent (oh and the cuc, tomato stuff they gave you when you sat down). The Baba had no flavor, the kibbeh had a weird, not good, taste and the meat pies were disgusting. We also got the chicken schwarma wrap. The chicken was old and hard- the worst pieces of meat were put in it. When the guy asked us if we wanted to take home the almost whole wrap we were leaving behind, and we said no, he didn't ask why. The kafta (kofta) was eh. Not very flavorful and it was flat. It's supposed to be log or cigar shaped- helps it be juicier, not to mention it's more meat. And the atmosphere/facilities are as bad as many ppl said but it also felt dirty. And I won't even say how scary it was to see the cook place vegetables on the grill right next to the raw meat. It might have helped if the veggies came out hot and cooked but they were cold with practically no sear. Nasty."
1,"Although I listed the Regent Square under \""Cinemas\"", it could well be listed under \""Performing Arts\"" too.  To be honest, the films that they show here are not to everybody's tastes and I go long stretches between attending films here.  They also have a lot of film festivals here too.  If you want more mainstream \""art\"" or \""indie\"" fare, you would do better to go to the Manor or Squirrel Hill.  \n\nPer the website, you can become a \""Screenie.\""  For $60.00, you get \n12 admissions to Pittsburgh Filmmakers theaters and 12 free popcorns or fountain drinks, both of which you can share with a friend.  You can also get a reduced rate on associate memberships to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers and a discount at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts' Shop.\n\nThis is a place to go where you are very serious about film, and as I said above, it is not to everyone's taste."
0,"I am so disappointed in this place. We read all the reviews and were so excited to find a good Chinese food place near our new home. This was not it. We ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli since we had little kids with us and that seemed like a safe bet. The broccoli beef was completely awful. It was hardly recognizable as beef when you took a bite because the beef was \""squishy\"". The sesame chicken was mediocre at best, it was so sweet that I could only eat a few bites. I figured this place was supposed to be a step up from Panda Express, but right now I sure wish I had chosen Panda! I am only giving it 2 stars because the counter staff seemed pleasant enough and the place was clean."
1,This place met expectations. I have been to the one in Cabo and wanted to go to the one in Vegas. Got a groupon which made it a great deal. I had the nachos off the appetizer list. They were to die for. It was big enough for three people. I would definately eat here again.
0,"So these guys were meant to finish putting my tires on in 45 minutes, yeah? Thus my hiatus to Culver's, yeah?

It didn't quite happen that way! \n     I strolled back from Culver's ready to drive off....but the numbers on my invoice were not the ones I paid for... they put on some tires that cost 90 bucks each, when I paid for 280 each for two!  Not sure why they did this....were they hoping that I would drive off not realizing since I'm female? ? ?"
0,"I have no idea who the staff think they are. I was immediately discriminated before I even was seated, the host said 'Just go to the bar.' I tried explaining to him I did not want to sit at the bar, I am pregnant. Well he had the audacity to offend me even more by asking me why I was all by myself.. WHAT? I ended up being sat by another hostess, she was walking to quickly I lost track of where she had even gone. Well when I sat down, I was very irritated. Well to make it even worse my server approached me and said 'Go sit at the bar like a normal person, fatty.' I'm just going to say I will never go back. I do not think anybody should be disrespected just to eat food."
0,"Worst venue ever!  \n\nWaited in a short line by one entrance,  about 15 feet from the merchandise table.  Security said we can't go straight to table,  have to walk around.  So we walk 1/4 mile around to another line.  Wait.  Go in. As the lady was about to scan our tickets,  I asked about the merch table.  She said go now and come back when done.  So we do that.  My kids get yelled at by security because we aren't allowed to come back in.  No line,  we just need to go back around.  Again. So we exit (by the first security guard) and walk the 1/4 mile again. As we get close to the front,  security stops us. We aren't allowed to bring in the merchandise that we just bought at the table. \n\nAre you ducking kidding me?? \n\nI managed to shove the crap into my purse,  and they reluctantly let us in. So we're back at the ticket scanner lady when some other lady cuts in front FROM THE MERCHANDISE TABLE and gets her ticket scanned before us.   My jaw fell to the floor.  If my daughters' lifetime of happiness was not so dependant on seeing Austin Mahone tonight,  I would have seriously flipped my shift at this point.  \n\nTicket scanner shrugged her shoulders and says,  \""she's VIP.\"" \n\nOk. I get it.  I'm not important enough to be treated like a human being.  Well then,  HRH,  you can go duck yourself.  This will be my last experience with anything related to Hard Rock.  I'll spend my money at places that appreciate me and don't treat me and my kids like lab rats. \n\nAnd you know what else?  It's Vegas,  summer,  110 degrees.  They waited until 20 minutes after the show started before turning on the a/c.  \n\n-- as I'm about to submit this,  my kids just pointed out paramedics helping someone that passed out.  I wonder if the heat had something to do with that."

0,"Honestly, the WORST SERVICE I have ever had at a restaurant in Las Vegas. I have lived here for 12 years and this was the first time I made it out to Lake Las Vegas. I am so disappointed. The prices are unreasonable for the amount of food you get and for a tapas place they are slow. It took us two hours before we got our food and some items were missing. Granted the food is amazing, it was just absolutely ridiculous with the service."
1,"Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  The rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can.\n\nThe only complaint I have are with the transport carts.  They are constantly beeping no matter what direction they're going.  I can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it's really annoying when it's constant.  Especially when you have 40 minutes to kill at the gate.\n\nThank goodness for the free WiFi..."
0,"I'm really not sure why people come here. Yes, I will admit the decor allows you a temporary escape of living in the midwest, but, that really the only thing going for it. I believe the quality of fish is extremely poor, over priced, and simply, not tasty. I have been there multiple times only to ask myself why? \n\nThe only reason why I guess I decided to give it two stars instead of one is the service and drinks. Only saving grace."
0,"My background: Eat out at least 2 times a week(many fine dining), love to cook and really enjoy delicious food and a great dining experience\n\nGood : Nice atmosphere. Server tried to act nice.\n\nBad : Pretty much everything else\n- Service: Server was not knowledgeable of the menu. Slow service. Did not seem to really care about us at all. Food was dropped on us and the individual seemed to not give 2 shits.\n- Food : We tried multiple dishes and everything was OK. Nothing stood out at all. Everything was relatively bland. Nothing came out hot, just room temperature really. I would not expect this quality for the price; actually I would not expect this quality for any amount of money. I can go somewhere else and  pay 10 bucks and get a meal that tastes 10 times better than this nonsense.\n\n- Overall : I really do not understand the hype. The head chef is some kind of contest winner of what not, but the food does not reflect that. Perhaps the people she is directing are not following through?.\n\nI am not writing this to hate on the place (I love M casino and have been going there for years), but just hoping others with good taste will see this and not have the same bad experience we had. What really sucks is this was my wife and I's anniversary dinner :("

1,"The word that comes to mind is gratuitous. The portion size, the amount of frosting on the cinnamon roll, the thick slices of French toast dripping with strawberries, the sauce, garlic, and cheese on the eggs...

0,"Wow!  Just wow!  Totally and utterly overrated.  I really wanted to believe the hype and hysteria.  I really did. \n\nMy best friend and I went there last week.  The menu was melon soup with lime sorbet, heirloom tomato and cheese salad, and either ribeye or curried fish.  \n\nFirst the atmosphere is fantastic, really quaint and romantic. The servers were well meaning too.  \n\nFirst course: the amuse Bouche soup. It was about two table spoons of melon smoothie that anyone with a Vitamix can make.  Oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a colorful swirl of who cares.  It was like getting dessert as appetizer but much less satisfying.\n\nSecond course: the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad.  \nIt had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slices of tomatos, three pieces of cheese and three quarters of a pound of sprouts of some \u00fcber micro green.  But to be fair it did have a shmear of some paste on the plate.  Basically tasteless, tomatoes were less than ripe and still very hard.   Really 55.00 for three slices of tomatoe, cheese and a handful of greens? Call me crazy but the value for a a foodie for food that tastes like my kindergartner made it is just not there.  Fail number two.  \n\nThird course entree:  I had the \""ribeye\"" and my friend had the curried fish.  The ribeye was unlike any ribeye I've had.  It frankly wasn't ribeye.  It was three medallions of lean beef over black lentils and drizzled with who cares wine reduction.  Again very lacking on flavor, contrast, and flavor.  But seriously folks who doesn't love a bite of top round with a deliciously bland mouthful of lentils to deaden all your taste buds?  Oh and before I forget, after we ordered my friend noted to me they didn't ask how you wanted your steak cooked.  So the next time the server came 'round we asked why and said I want it rare.  The server (who I think is in training bc he seemed to have to ask the other server everything - which is fine better sad than sorry there's a sometimes steep learning curve in fine dining) said, \""the steak is cooked medium rare the way the chef wants it.\""  Now I haven't worked with Gordon Ramsey but I bet you a million dollars that he'd ask the patron for his opinion on the matter.  That said I still really think he was in training and forgot to ask and didn't want to go back to the kitchen and get yelled at for not asking etc.  Been there myself.  Fine medium rare will do just fine - the chef said so.  \n\nMy friend's curried fish (I totally forgot what type of fish but I think it was mahi mahi) was the best dish of the night.  But it too was not that impressive.   I think I would rather hit malees for fish in curry sauce.  And again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish.  \n\nThe final course was dessert.  We ordered two Lagavulin 16s on the rocks (it took a minute because the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch options) to go with the...oh wait the dessert was so unmemorable I forgot what it was.  I literally can't remember what it was.  But I do remember being unimpressed and saying to my friend the first course soup would've been a better dessert.  \n\nLastly the bill.  The night before we ate at Mastro's In Scottsdale and had  a much much better bill to food ratio.  And I am a ravenous foodie and I understand small courses and I Know it's not a steak house.  My point here is that at the most expensive steakhouse in Scottsdale where the ribeye is 70 dollars or so and you know you are being plundered for meat you could buy at AJs and grill or put in your salamander you are still getting tastier food and more bang for your buck.  Or likewise if you went to Binkleys in cave creek your money would be So much better spent.  Food doesn't get masked and duct taped with lentils there.  And you could do 3 or 5 or 7 courses or just order off the menu AND Chef Binkley will take the time to ask if there is any special accommodations for allergies, taste profiles etc that he needs to change or modify for you.  Oh and it tastes amazing so you get your money's worth.  At cafe monarch (where the chef is king) they must be doing summer budget cuts and dialing the food down a notch as the snow birds leave and the locals get the table scraps, or maybe it was an off night, or maybe they just serve food that way I don't know but frankly it sucked.  TOTALLY AND UTTERLY OVERRATED AND UNIMPRESSIVE!  \nOh and the ice cubes for our scotch cost $2.00 each.  That's right two dollars for frozen water put into a rocks glass.  Seriously, the budget must be really out of balance."
1,"Every time I go here I find something unique and very well-priced.  It is enjoyable and the service is great.  I only meant to browse but I ended up spending a whole evening in this store because they carry home furnishings as well.  I just could not leave.  The collections are unique and varied from diffusion lines of high-end brands to high-end brands.  They carry almost the same stuff as Holt Renfrew but I never feel out of place.  They make brand name accessible and not reverential as they do in Toronto  I like that approach very much.  \n\nThe service is very friendly.  I asked for help to get a dress out of the mannequin and they quickly accommodated.  Eventhough I did not end up buying it they did not give me any grief about it.  I wish I had more hours to spend in this wonderful store.  Maybe it was not meant to come to Toronto because the cutthroat retail of TO will blemish its European flair.  I understand so until my next trip to Montreal, I will save my pennies so I can spend it contentedly on this great establishment."

This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. \n\nLike I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. \n\nThe washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently \""broke down\"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to \""resolve\"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.\n\nBut, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. \nI called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. \n\nI then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final \""pulled strings\"" to \""accommodate\"" my original delivery request. \nBut...it's not over yet. \n\nThe second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. \n\nI don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. \n\nSo my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. \n\nThis is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment."
1,"We tried The Turf for breakfast this weekend.  We were definitely not in the mood to wait a lifetime for Matt's after perusing the market, so we decided to head over to the Turf.  As expected, the place was empty except for one guy at the bar... considering it was like 9 am I am really hoping this guy was just drinking apple juice.  Our server was very nice, and I am pretty sure we had her on our first night here.  After explaining to us what black and white pudding was, ewww, and then running away, she came back for our breakfast order.  I got the Bacon and Cheese Omelet and the husband got Biscuits and Gravy.  My breakfast was served with hashbrowns and toast.  The hashbrowns were thin and crispy, just the way I like it.  My omelet was stuffed to the max with bacon and oozing melty cheese.  It wasn't a big fluffy omelet like at IHOP but it was a dense solid little guy.  I much prefer my omelets to be like this.  The husband was a little less than pleased with his meal.  We both agreed the gravy was pretty good and we really liked that there was actually sausage in it, the way it should be.  The disappointment was definitely in the biscuits though.  They were certainly not fresh and definitely not homemade.  Considering how easy and quick biscuits are to make, this bummed me out.  To the owner of Turf:  If you want me to, I will be more than happy to come over and show you how to make a good biscuit.  If there are good, fresh biscuits, this could be a great dish.  Not the best for breakfast, but a good alternative for when we don't feel like waiting for hours in the hot morning sun."
1,"I went out to do some groceries yesterday and suddenly I was hit with a craving for macarons. I don't know why, it kind of came from out of nowhere, but I am not one to deny myself a treat now and again so I picked up my canvas shopping bag and headed up to Nancy's.\n\nNancy's carries about 18 or so flavors of macarons. Some flavors intrigued me more than others and I narrowed my choices down to 5 flavours; exotic, chai, celery, licorice-lavender and salted caramel. Macarons are quite expensive, here they are 9$ per 100 grams (keep in mind that means they are 90$ a kilo!) and my 9 (2 of each of four flavors and just one salted caramel) tasty treats came to just about 16$.\n\nNancy's also sells their homemade jams and sorbet, as well as pastries and marzipan treats. While I contemplated my flavor choices I ordered an almond croissant. I didn't much care for it. The ends were kind of hardened and the almond paste was a bit scarce.\n\nI saw some wonderful cakes leaving the kitchen, and seemingly happy customers enjoy a quick lunch with friends. So, next time I am up that way, maybe I'll stop in for a quick bite and just a few more macarons of course!"
0,"Dropped in spontaneously last Saturday when I was shopping in the Quarter just to see what it was all about. Since it was like 2 PM, the place was pretty dead, but the bartender and hostess were friendly - I had the \""health conscious panini\"" (not sure about the actual name) and I have to say, the quality sucked ass. It tasted like they used wonder bread, and it was wayyyy too cheesy (it had tomato, avocado and goat cheese - the avocado was a teeny tiny slice on each half). When asked by the attentive bartender how the food was, I said \""Well...the fries are okay\"". He didn't inquire further, though he had a great personality.\n\nI like the nouveau Belle Epoch interior. Most likely, though, I won't be back."
0,"While the quality of the food is good, the priority of the kitchen really makes you wonder at how they even function at times. While our visit was on a week night and when it really wasn't all that busy, they still somehow managed to complete three orders that were no more complicated than ours... for people that ordered AFTER US. \n\nI had a half sandwich with salad and her with a bowl of soup. How complicated is that, seriously? The person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff. \n\nThis was disappointing to say the least and perhaps was an isolated incident. Then again, most likely not.\n\n*Update*\n\nI have received a very nicely worded and very sincere email from one of the founders relating to our visit. We have spoken about this visit in question and I am satisfied with the end result. As such, I have amended my review from two stars to three.\n\n*Update to update*\n\nAs of today, 22 DEC 14, I have yet to receive any further contact as it related to my initial review despite replying both via Yelp and a direct email as requested. As such, my review goes back down to two stars. Pretty disappointed given how promising the initial contact seemed to be. We definitely will not be going back now"
1,"I buy most of my shoes at Jones Bootmaker for two very good reasons - 1) this particular Jones very often has massive sales racks so if you spend a bit of time looking, you can get a good bargain, and 2) they carry quality shoes.\n\nWhen buying shoes, I want them to look good, be comfortable, and be as cheap as possible.  Jones definitely ticks all of those boxes for me.  Now, don't come here expecting to spend a tenner on something you'll wear for 3 months and will then fall apart/go out of fashion.  These are proper shoes that you will have for a while, and this is reflected in the price, even when it is a bargain.  \n\nI've knocked off a star because the sale racks definitely give this place a somewhat downmarket feel to it and the staff can be a bit hit or miss."
0,"Old, dirty and disorganized!  The security lines and baggage claim areas are horribly overcrowded.  Service is slow.  Tear it down and start over!"
1,I tried it again and the food is still good but I have to say the servers are still on probation .  Need more training here . The third time should be a charm if not I'll go somewhere else and try again .
1,"We sat outside to enjoy The Strip view and were treated to a good, quick lunch. We ordered food and in less than 10 minutes it was at our table. Amazing. Try the tacos al carbon platter, street tacos on corn tortillas with fresh ingredients and nice spices.\n\nThe wait staff was laid back and cool. A great view and a nice meal."
0,"Ok,  I hate to pile on to this place.  It has SOOO MUCH potential and the whole area wants them to succeed!  The restaurant itself is really nice inside and out and the concept seems like it would be a lot of fun but.... It's not.  \n\nThe service is slow and seems confused.  They food is well.. just blah.  I have been there twice and it is the only time in years of eating out that I have felt the need to add salt and pepper to my dishes, BOTH TIMES!  There are way too many really good places to eat just minutes from this restaurant for about the same price.  Also, what is with the truck Trailer(s) in your parking lot.  It's not a big lot in the first place.  \n\nOk so enough bashing.  You have a great concept and a great looking restaurant.  Figure out your kitchen so food comes out timely.  Tweek your recipes so the food had a lot more flavor.  (We put up with \""True Food\"" portion sizes only because the food is pact with flavor.) Organize your servers and wait staff so it is more efficient and organized (you may think it's organized but it doesn't seem like it or look like it.) Finally, if you want it to be a neighborhood hang give us a GREAT Happy Hour! Good drink and appetizer specials and a cheap kick-butt Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's on the weekends.  I really hope you guys get it together because you could be a lot of fun!\n\nOh and fix your water in the bathroom hot is always on the left!"
1,"we were making a decision on where to go for a champagne brunch.  I read all the reviews and almost passed this place because of negative reviews.\nI am going to say that it depends on you.  If you search for a restaurant by who the chef is and what awards he has won nationally, then this isn't the place for you - actually no buffet is for you.  HOWEVER,  I AM a foodie, so I am a bit picky.  I want flavor and don't want it covered by salt or sugar.  \n\n     6 of us enjoyed the breakfast without any complaints. The omelet station was full of every option we could think of.  And the omelet cook had skills.  One of the group couldn't figure out what to add (so many options) so he suggested that he make him the omelet that he cooks for himself.  Excellent job!\nThey had 2 soups on the buffet - turkey and seafood bisque.  Generally a seafood bisque has no seafood - I was pleasantly surprised - and I commented that I would have been proud to have called it mine.  (and I make an amazing seafood chowder).\n     \n     The options for breakfast we as you would expect:  pancakes, waffles,salads, sandwiches, fruit, all the breakfast meats, fried chicken, biscuits and gravy and the rest of what you would expect.  \n\n     Right on the way to Hoover Dam - really - it is a light in the middle of the road to turn in.  And no wait at 12:00 on a Sunday afternoon.  The dining room wait staff was sufficient - her name was Miami Florida - she did just fine - I don't expect the Four Seasons service if I am not at the Four Seasons (their brunch is 40.00)\n\n    Didn't have room for dessert - (none of us could fit anything else)  so I'm not going to provide a review for them.\n\nMy goal is to let you know that if you are interested in having a low priced breakfast, even on Sunday morning - you will be well satisfied."
1,"I've been coming here for about 6 months now, every week and a half or so.  In the 7 or so years that I've lived here I've mainly gone to 4 different barber shops (depending on where I lived).  This place is interesting....  Never seen a place quite like it.  Typically when I've moved to a new city, I try to find a good \""ghetto\"" barber...  pardon the expression.  But typically the best barber shops are well....  not usually located in the best parts of town.  When I moved to vegas I did the same.... found MLK blvd and viola!  Good barber shops.  But that's too far a drive....\n\nAnyway, this place is good...  similar style to your typical predominantly black barber shop....  although everyone that works there is hispanic.  And it's located in the middle of China Town.  Haha...  They get a good mix of customers, mostly hispanic...  but not a big deal, they almost all speak english well enough (one guy I can think of doesn't).  I usually go early mornings and never really have to wait long... although later in the day they can get busy... and it's hard to tell who has appts. when you just walk in.  \n\nBottom line.... they're friendly enough, and do a pretty good fade.   That's all I need to know.   Oh, and cash only.... although I believe they have an ATM there."
1,"Pro:  value, charm, quality, independent\n\nCon:  haven't found one yet....\n\nSleeper alert.  Great breakfast, well-priced served with a smile. Ditto for dinner. Simple, relatively healthy comfort food.   Good Euro feel to it but not overkill.  Nice change of pace from the generic chains.  \nWell worth a try for a quiet couples dinner or breakfast with the kids--they can draw, play hangman etc on the butcher paper table top.  Comp. rolls to start and dessert to finish with breakfast.  Nice touch."
1,"There is ALWAYS a silver lining.\n\nI just want to say first that though Amy P.'s experience wasn't the best, you can always make lemons out if lemonade. \n\nMy bus yesterday had it worse off but ultimately had the best experience of everyone who had taken their buses earlier than me.\n\nWe arrived around 7:30am at the Info Center and the men who instructed us where to go did it in such a nice, humorous and very detailed manner that you couldn't get lost unless you didn't pay attention. After grabbing our wristbands and buying some water we headed out to our bus which acts on a first come, first serve basis. \n\nMy mom and I had decided to take the tour to Grand Canyon's South Rim and were actually the first bus to go. Everything was smooth sailing from our narrator to Hoover Dam to even our stop at Mickey D's. Everything was so pleasant until 2.5 hours into the bus ride.\n\nLemme tell you now that I have always had bad luck follow me, on this particular day it was supposed to rain for a start. \n\nOur bus' computer broke down and had to be re-started; a process which took a little less than an hour yet yielded no results. One backup bus was called which later had to be moved back on it's course so the company sent another bus. The bus was going to arrive in an hour. By the time it arrived we had sat in the bus for 2.5 hours.\n\nEveryone in the bus could have been irate and complained bitterly, but we didn't. The reason? Ryan, our amazing, superb and wonderful bus driver. Our bus driver was so calm, so collected that the mood of everyone in the bus was of great patience. He made our terrible predicament into an enjoyable time. \n\nAfter we switched buses, our hero, Ryan, told us that we were going to make lemons our of lemonade. He didn't lie about that. Sure, some people were not able to make their tours, but the pink jeep and the helicopter tours cancelled all their torus all day due to the bad weather. People who had booked these tours were actually okay with that. Everyone realized that it was the bus that broke down, not the fault of a single man and the company had been punctual to dispatch another bus for us.\n\nWe got to the Grand Canyon and before we reached the first viewpoint he told the bus that since we are the last bus arriving, we get 100% visibility. Apparently the buses before who arrived on time got 0% visibility due to the rain. We got there, it was 70 degrees, sunny and the clouds were clearing over a MAJESTIC scene. It was SO WORTH IT. Everything which had led up to seeing the Grand Canyon- the commentary, the scenery, the bus breaking down; it made finally seeing the Grand Canyon the most worth it sight. \n\nWe were able to see the Grand Canyon at sunset, the most beautiful time of the day and yes, you can't beat seeing it for yourself. \n\nOur ride back consisted of a 4-5 hour journey where pretty much everyone slept aside from the movie time. The only part I didn't like was our replacement driver, Mike who gave Ryan a break half way so he could go home. He should; it was already 12:08am and we arrived at our hotel around 1:30am. Mike was alright, but lacked the humor and patience that Ryan had. (This is probably why he drove the night bus since we're all sleeping.) \n\nIt was a crazy day. Like they say, life is about the journey, not the destination."
1,"Great for fast food sushi! Decent prices, good variety, clean and friendly service. You must try if you are a sushi lover, but not the kind that has made sushi a delicacy with its outrageous prices here in AZ, but the kind of sushi lover that just wants to have their sushi fix without having to save up all month for it!"
0,"I have been a loyal customer of Red House for about a year now and I have never received such poor service!  It was just one thing after another!  First, I had a coupon for a free orange chicken and I was not able to use it though I should have been able to.  I called to place a delivery order and they informed me that the coupon was only good for dine in or carry out, though there was no indication of this on the coupon.  Then, I was supposed to get free delivery since I spent over $15 and I was charged $1.00.  On top of all of this my noodles were mushy and bland.  The delivery man was very nice but that's about the only positive thing I can say."
0,Terrible service! After paying I was seated rather quickly but it went down hill after that. The waitress didn't acknowledged that we even needed service until I complained about it 25 minutes later. She was avoiding our table and the one next to us. After we complained she finally came over to act friendly because her boss heard about it. \n\nWhile the entire length of the non - service she never asked us what we would like to drink or even greeted us. The only common denominator was that we and the table next to us were not white. She seemed to be serving all the white people in her area non stop the whole time. I felt embarrassed and frustrated that I had to complain to a manager and nothing changed even then. Food was okay and lacking in variety but decent. \n\nPrice was not worth the aggravation.  We left after eating without being asked if we wanted a drink the entire service. I will never go to this buffet ever again. I also will not recommend this to the many friends that visit Las Vegas. We weren't the only ones that experienced this racist waitress. Avoid this like the plague. White people only. Sorry but that's how everyone in her area that wasn't white felt like. Three other groups also as we were leaving had no service.\n\nShitty Valentines day!
1,"It was good.  I'm not going to spend too much time reviewing as my sentiments have been expressed over and over in these reviews.\n\nGreat burger for an exuberant price.  I had the Rising Sun which is probably the most unique burger on the menu with tempura fried avocado slices, a \""teriyaki\"" which was more of a Korean bulgogi type of sauce, crispy onions and a fried egg which I added manually.  Great burger, but nothing that blew my pants off.\n\nI sat at the bar and the bartender was on top of things.  She was very attentive and always had my drink refilled.  This was an off hour however and I was like one of maybe 15 people in the restaurant.\n\n\nI still prefer Burger Bar to all of the other burger joints on the strip."
0,"Being from Hawaii we decided to try this place we were so disappointed the fried won ton was like mini gau gee without the meat.  the duck was greasy and mostly fat, the beef brocolli cake noodles lacking and manapua really?  maybe it was an off day but I do not think I would go again."
1,mmm yummy! New menu is interesting.
0,"Tried to get a pizza delivered to my aunt, but they wouldn't process the order even though I wanted to pay the tip before hand. They were extremely rude and not accommodating at all. Even refused to put the pepperoni in the shape of a heart. Called pizza hut instead. They were nice."
0,"I have been going to this cafe for the past 5 years. The other day was the first time I had been there in a year and it was horrible. The waiter delivered our food and never returned to give us refills or ask if we needed anything. The biscuits and sausage gravy were horrible. The biscuits might as well be hockey pucks. I could barely get the fork in the biscuit to cut it in half.  And then when it was time to go and my friend wanted to box the rest of his meal up, we had to find a bus boy to bring a box.  Unfortunately, all the bus boy did was tell our waiter we needed a box. The waiter carried the to-go box  to us and handed it to my friend without ever looking at him and then he walked away. It was the worst service I have ever had and will probably not go back even though I absolutely love the gravy to the biscuits and gravy."
0,"Today I was feeling very sleepy so I sent a note to a colleague and asked if she wanted to go for coffee and she suggested FTC.  We got there and ordered our coffee and I decided to order a sandwich for my lunch later that day also.  While waiting for the coffee, the owner I can only assume stopped to talk to us. Under the cart she was pushing was a small child who reached up and essentially goosed my butt.  Not quite that far up but it was enough that I was so startled that it caused me to knock over my friend's coffee because I was just trying to stay away from this kid who more than likely would have done it again. I don't know if he thought I was his mom standing next to the cart or what, but it seriously spooked me. You just don't expect to be grabbed standing waiting for a sandwich.  \n\nNow I could forget all that if the sandwich were worth a damn, but it wasn't.  The bread was horribly dry, and dense. Someone mentioned earlier that there are no condiments, and they weren't kidding.  This sandwich was as dry as the Mohave desert.  I'd go back for coffee if it was the last place to go, but honestly for a better cup of coffee and a bite to take back to the office, Carly's or Hob Nobs is always a better option."
1,Excellent gyros. Eat here quite a bit and its always good.
1,Best chocolate muffins ever! A must try.
0,"It's a biker bar.  Drunk biker girl had to be hauled off, she should have been cut off much earlier.   Do not recommend if you want a quiet lunch.\nSeating uncomfortable, decent food, chilli did not have any flavor, pulled pork sandwich was tastey, but the bread was soggy.  The cornbread was awesome, beer was cold.\nThe server, Adrian, was excellent."
1,"Out of the way - but well worth the visit. Good selection of beers and 2 floors of great atmosphere.\nI love the food and the salads are indeed the best you can get - Well done to Steph (the Food / Kitchen Manager) I love coming here by myself and with Friends. There is always someone I meet that I know. The bar staff is very friendly and helpful. The place is big, HUGE even in comparison with Boda, Sofi's, Victoria & JP's (in order of size) - this is a bar that can host many local, area and yes, (inter-) national events and they do.\nKnitting, baking, jogging, tastings and disco's (or should I say clubbing) Swedish Mafia stylee :o) \nI like it and only wished it was closer to town.."
0,"I had been here twice years ago. We were meeting family for brunch they selected this establishment. We found out you cannot make reservations. We were a party of 8. The person on the phone suggested coming by 10:30 before the church crowd arrives. \nWe did arrive at 10:30 and it was crazy busy. We put our name on the list and waited. They seemed to forget about us and gave our table away after having told us they had one just waiting for that party to finish up. After another 10 minutes  we were seated. It is so noisy inside. You cannot even hear yourself think, never mind have a conversation. Not an ideal situation for seeing family from out of town. \nOnce seated the staff was very accommodating. The service was great. \nThe food not so much. I found my dish the Indiana favorite sage chicken with eggs very bland. I did not care for the mashed potatoes, again no flavor. The biscuit was good. \nAnd quite frankly it is just too much darn food."
1,"This has been my neighborhood bar for about a decade.  Good pool tables, reasonable drink prices (cheap Guinness during Happy Hour).  Good staff and a very mixed crowd."
0,We went there to eat and try it out.  We walked in they gave us menus and never seen them again.  We waited for 10 min.  DO NOT GO HERE.
0,This was our first (and last time) going here. We wanted a taco Tuesday. A friend recommended it to us. We sat for at least 15 with nothing. Got our drink order filled. No chips or water for us. Food was just okay. Couldn't order desert cause nobody told our server the kitchen was closed. Too many other places to go than to go through that again...
1,"I went looking for Nargile and found Yeni in its place. But, after speaking with the waitress, it turns out Yeni is owned by the same people who owned Nargile. They have simply rebranded, and reopened under a different name, to highlight a similar but updated menu. The main change being that they now individually mark all mezze dishes as Gluten Free, Dairy Free, or Vegan. Having several friends who fit every description, this is a good update to see.\n\nCompared to other Turkish restaurants I've been to, it may not have the dark wooded, colourful, candelit interior and atmosphere. It's very New Town and George Street -sleek, pollished, minimalist, perhaps I'd go so far to say it's lacking in personality?\n\nBut that's just the decoration. The staff were very friendly and chatty (hence how I discovered it is owned by Nargile). \n\nThe food was also really quite delicious. I don't know how it compares to traditional Turkish mezze, but I really enjoyed mine. The lunch deal of 3 mezze for \u00a39.90 that runs every day Mon - Sat (except Sunday, when they're not open) was really fantastic. I took home a doggy bag for dinner, the portions were so big.\n\nThe calamari was deliciously soft. The pan-fried aubergine, whilst cold (a surprise) was delicious and the feta & spinach filo rolls were perhaps a little heavy on the pastry but still nice. The lamb kebab my dining partner ordered also looked very nom-tastic.\n\nI don't think I'd go out of my way to come back to Yeni, as I love atmosphere and it just feels a little minimalist. But if I were in town I'd definitely make use of the lunch deal again, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious, good value meal.\n\nMo' mezze!"
0,"A group of us went last night, the lights were dimmed so low it was impossible to see the menu, we asked twice to turn the lights up and the waiter said the manager yelled at him when he tried to turn them up - so the waiter had to bring out several candles in order for us to read the menu.  \n\nThe prices were reasonable, the noise was loud, the seating was nice but the main thing was they were out of certain items on the menu - they ran out of calamari and ricotta cheese.  I have never been to any Italian restaurant which ran out of ricotta cheese and since about 1/4 of the menu had items with ricotta they were not available to order.  Also the kitchen closes down even if their are people in the restaurant ordering food so that too limited the food we could order.  \n\nWhen ordering the Italian Sausage be advised the sausage is hot not mild so it is spicy which should be on the menu but was not, also when ordering hot tea be advised they do not have teapots nor do they bring a saucer for the tea cup so the waiter had to keep bringing cups of hot water out for us since there were no teapots.\n\n  Reasonable Prices, Some really good food while other food was just plain not good, The desserts - the cannolis which are real easy to make were very good and the tiramusi was good as well.  Their bread and rolls are home made but when they bring them out they are stone cold and taste awful so ask for hot bread and you will need to ask for it as the waiter will not casually bring it.  Also the wait staff does not bring out table spoons so we can roll our pasta and everything took so long the waiter just waited on us no personality, it took forever for he to come back and check on us and we were the only people in the restaurant so the service needs help\n\nWe went back the following Thursday to see maybe they were having a bad night or something nope it was the same - they were out of two more ingredients this time - hot green tea and cavelli pasta plus we had to send out pizza which was awful back and the cannolis which were good the first visit were sent back this visit as they left out a key ingredient from the cream.  This place is hit and miss and the food is below average.  the appetizers are good esp the dates and the brie cheese otherwise not much else."
0,This is not an art gallery. Like the name states its an interiors retail store - that hangs art.
0,I had the same experience as Anabel A.in the previous review. The man used his nails to push my cuticles. He has a dirty towel under my hand with nail scraps on it from people before.. he used dirty tools.. he coughed in my face... it was gross.. i should have known better.\nnever go here! i certainly wont.
0,"Went there once. Was about 9:30 pm, not too busy. I was hoping for a bigger crowd. Band was great! Drinks were very expensive. I recommend that the manager or marketing person solicit the current customers and/ or the community for referrals by discounted drinks or something . This may increase the crowd. Oh yeah, the bartender (girl) wasn't friendly , had she been ... We may have stayed for a bit more. We weren't impressed ."
0,"UNSANITARY conditions, FOOD TEMPERATURES not correct, Cross contamination visibly apparent - BAD MANAGEMENT and Hygiene issues with servers: AVOID AT ALL COSTS SERIOUSLY. I have never been so negative and critical in  my reviews, I was treated poorly by management when I complained about food temperatures, \""he\"" plainly said \""I DON'T CARE!\"" multiple times to me in front of others. The meat was lukewarm, the tempura was hard as in old and greasy, the selection was limited, the supposed to be chilled shrimp was moist and lukewarm as well. I had to stop eating as I bit into tasteless, hard, greasy bits. I still paid my $40 (prices of drinks not included) but easily could have left the minute I saw the food. My mistake. I SAW the server pull his dirty pants from the butt crack section  (in front of me) while serving drinks to other table. The waitress made me wait 10 minutes before I got up to ask for more drinks, I literally walked across the restaurant to get a hold of her even though it this place was empty. The seats were sticky and walls had orange chicken fingerprints all over, the floor had grease, crumbs, dry food juice. The 'GRILL, HOW IRONIC SINCE THEY CALL THEMSELVES Buffet GRILL\"" was not being attended by any cook, the sushi avocado was old and browned so not appetizing. The ice cream barrels (self serve by scooping) was almost empty so when people scoop their ice cream inside the barrels their dirty bare hands touch the same ice cream the next person gets..ON and On... I asked to speak to a \""manager\"" and all he could say was \""I don't care, you have to pay\"" about 4 times loudly. THEY WILL EVENTUALLY SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME, HEADACHE OR MONEY. Oh also if you don't eat all your food on the plate at this \""BUFFET\"" then there is a sign that you may have to pay extra for leftovers not eaten on site, what a JOKE! Oh...servers might not understand your English either. \n( I would not take time out of my life to write this if I was not seriously concerned majorly about the unsanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in this ill-ran place)."
1,"Another build-your-burger chain? Yes!\nIs it different from the rest? Yes!\n\nFor those not aware - Cheeburger Cheeburger is a fairly large US chain that is now expanding with franchises into Canada. This location is their first. \n\nThe decor is that of a 1950's diner. But with a lot of pink on the wall!\n\nMy friend and I went on the second day after opening - so the wait staff was a little slow and rusty on the menu. I'll give them the benefit and hold back any comments on service for another time. I did however enjoy the owner (sitting at the table next to us) ask if we had been served yet - and sent over a waiter.\n\nI ordered the Semi-Serious, with provolone cheese, and an array of condiments (all free), cooked medium-well. The burger came served on a nice warm bun and was great. A great thing is that all of their beef is locally grown and processed.\n\nAlong with the burger, my friend and I shared a \""Best of Both\"" medium basket - That's half fries and half onion rings. \n\nThe onion rings were the best we had ever tasted! Nice and crunchy and not too oily. Their fries and onion rings are cooked in peanut oil. So if you are allergic - be warned.\n\nFor drinks - as in true fashion of a 50's diner. There are a lot of fountain drinks. Aside from the brand name pops (Coke, Sprite..) , they also have VanillaCola, CherryCola, ChocoCola, Rootbeer floats, Dr. Pepper Floats and more. All soft drinks are served in mason jars! \n\nAnother popular menu item are their shakes. With over 300,000 possible combinations - can you really say there is a favorite? With all the food we had. We decided to put off the shakes for our next visit.."
1,"Excellent  studio with great instructors. If you are looking for HOT Yoga I highly recommend this place. The instructors are all talented in different ways, but so far Gabe has been my favorite, he has a wonderful selection of music and I prefer his flow movements. When I am there I can literally feel the toxins sweating out of my body and the heat helps me come in to deeper asanas. \n\nIf you have never done HOT yoga before, be warned. The class is 90 minutes and you need to come in well hydrated (drink a  gallon of water throughout the day before class).\nThe temperature is over 100 degrees so you will sweat the minute you step in the room. The cleansing benefits are worth it and this studio does it justice!"
1,"My husband and I tried this place for the first time tonight. My tepanyaki was amazing. My husband had sashimi and loved it. The pieces were a little small and the menus were sticky, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
0,"Food, service and lighting are reminiscent of Denny's on a bad night. The wine glass was so small it was distracting. Too bad, so little competition in the area."
0,"The Good:\n-I liked the decor.  It was very pretty.\n-The \""Soup of the Day\"" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.  I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy.\n-Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list.\n-The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The waiter was not friendly.  He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever.\n-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).  You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa.  Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the \""Tapa of the Day,\"" because he didn't even know what it was.  ....What the f?  Why?!\n-I had the Korean Hot Pot.  I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't.  It was extremely sweet.  So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice.  It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice.  Blech!\n\nThe Ugly:\n-I got food poisoning.  Thank you, Korean Hot Pot.  My guts are still kvetching about you.\n\n...The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back.  If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score.  Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect."
1,"Love the staff, good specials, comfortable place with gaming, food & pool."
0,"I had to give a star because it's mandatory, but this place should not get one at all. \nMy friend and I ate here one night, we were practically alone in this dead restaurant. After the way were treated and the food I can see why it was dead. \nThe waitress took about 5 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink, then took about another 10 to take our dinner order. She told us that rice was not included with our meal and that we had to get it on the side at and extra cost, but the whole meal had rice so I don't know what she was trying to do. After she dropped off our food she came back and was trying to make me put my food on to another plate and got mad when I said no. Then about 20 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted a box for the rest of my food and I told her no she got mad and didnt come back. We had to go up to the cashier and explain our order to him, right after we did that she finally came over and tried to get in the middle of everything. \n\nThis was the first time I ever had this type of food and at this place, I don't think I will ever try either again."
0,"noisy, mediocre pizza"
0,Everything here was just average. Average burgers and average pasta dishes. Nothing set them apart from a standard chain restaurant. The prices were fine and the waiter we has was great but this is the kind of place I won't really seek out to go again.
0,I will give two stars just for the sake of their smoothies and by using fresh fruits. \n\nI've been here once and tasted some of their menus. Not a fan of their food. So tedious and just an ordinary Chinese resto.
0,"How the @$#%&?! do you screw up rice and call yourself an Asian place? \n\nI don't understand those who say this is the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I drove here from Oakland based on the reviews, but the rolling cart in the atrium of Newell-Simon Hall at CMU is better. This place is super, super cheap, but you get what you pay for. Cash only, no delivery. The staff are friendly, and know their regulars by face, but the food is greasy, below-average Chinese take out, and their rice is hard and undercooked. It wasn't a one-time thing, either. I went a second time (it is cheap) and the rice turned out the same. I will not be going back again, especially when I live a block from Orient Kitchen."
1,"There's few things better than sitting on a terasse in warm weather, with good company, and enjoying a sweet or savory snack. I had the dark chocolate crepe made with semi-sweet chocolate. It was generous in the amount of chocolate, I just found the crepe to be a little too thin in certain areas. Also, the service was a bit slow...it seemed to be not the busiest time of day but there were a number of other patrons at the time. Was it good? Absolutely, and it's a nice change of pace compared to my usual spots. I'll definitely be back again to try something else."
1,"I had heard good things about the Crepe Cellar, so when a friend suggested it as a the location for group Sunday brunch my interests were piqued. Having passed by en route to other NoDa locations, I knew that seating was not particularly plentiful, but I was pleased when my roommate and I arrived first in our group (at 1:15) and were able to score a booth for six.  We ordered a french press of coffee to split (with the acknowledgment that we could always order another later) while we waited for the rest of our party. It was fresh, tasty and the timer they gave us to determine when the coffee was to our particular strength liking was both helpful and adorable, but there was no doubt we would be ordering seconds. I hate to admit it, but as a coffee fiend I would have sacrificed some on quality to add some quantity.\n\nOne of our friends used to work at Crepe Cellar, and she ordered a plate of pesto brie fries for the table. I owe here thanks for this because they were delightful, particularly when paired with their tomato ranch which she asked for on the side. I had had a hankering for shrimp and grits all week, so I was pleased to see that they were on the specials board. The grits were creamy but not pasty, the shrimp were plentiful and the gravy was perfectly seasoned and tasted of white wine and hugs. One of our friends ordered the mussels special, which came with a lemongrass & sweet chili sauce and between she and her boyfriend, not a mussel escaped uneaten. Our ex-employee companion got the eggs benedict. The roomie opted for the Sausage & Egg Breakfast Crepe. The flavor from the sausage and red peppers really shone through and the homefries which accompanied were nice and crisp. Where the coffee lacked quantity, the food certainly didn't (particularly the crepes) and I was forced to abandon my last shrimp to the dish pan.\n\nIt is hard to comment on the service since the waitress was friends with someone at our table so we were obviously well attended, but I did not get the impression that we would have been left wanting otherwise. The atmosphere was bright and perfectly suited for a Sunday brunch. Prices ran in the 8-13 dollar range for our main dishes, though be warned coffee will run you about 5 bucks.\n\nOverall, Crepe Cellar hit the spot and was a nice change of pace from our normal Sunday pancake routine."
1,"Now, a somewhat dinner review.\n\nMy out of town visitor said she wanted a place like Buffalo Wild Wings, but better. And she wanted beer. I said...ok. Culinary Dropout it is.\n\nLast night, we were promptly seated, ordered our beverages, and then got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Absolutely amazing. As always. It was my day off from the gym, so I said...\""What the hell!\""\n\nInstead of ordering entrees, we decided to order a place of prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and some manchego cheese, served with crostinis.\n\nEverything was flavorful. The sun dried tomatoes were perfectly marinated, the manchego was at just the right temperature, and the prosciutto was finely sliced like a delicate piece of angel paper. What the hell is angel paper? I have no idea. I am just free-writing. Go with it.\n\nBottom line, you will never go wrong here. Appetizers, Entrees, Charcuterie....anything. This is your spot. \n\nService is a tad spotty in the evening, but I suppose that CAN be a good thing if you are in a good conversation."
1,"Wisconsin Craft Market has been causing quite a stir in the Midwest knitting blogs lately and as an avid knitter, I decided to make the 2+ hour trip from my hometown of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.  \n\nI have been knitting feline apparel for the last 28 years; coats, collars, dresses, mittens, hats, and capes are just a few of the products I create and donate to cat shelters across the country. \n\nUpon entering the market, a distinguished-looking man with a beard politely directed me to the store's yarn section, aptly named the \""Wall of Cascade\"". Now, I spent my youth living in a small Idaho town located in the Cascade range, and I must tell you; the plethora of colors in Wisconsin Craft's yarn section was reminiscent of my days spent in that beautiful mountain range. \n\nWell done, Wisconsin Craft Market!

From now on, my 3 cats and the countless homeless felines across the country will be donning yarn and buttons sold from your charming establishment. \n\nHave a blessed day,\n\nKittyKnitter17"
0,"I went to ER with terrible pain on my left side and it could barely breathe... My chest Xray was wrongly diagnosed and i was sent home from ER still in total pain... I had never been to the ER in my life so i went home thinking maybe i was being a baby about the pain.... 2 days later i woke up in the middle of the night in so much pain even worse than before... I told my husband to drive me to the ER and he was like \""Why, they didn't admit you last time?\"" I told him i don't care and to take me NOW.... I get there and they bring me back for another chest Xray and my left lung was almost collapsed... The ER thanked me for coming back so soon.... Shame on St Rose and Shame on Radiology Associates of Nevada .... Now i owe them tons of money .... they almost cost me my life and now they are sending me bill after bill... I feel that if i was diagnosed properly the first ER visit that i would not of spent 3 WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL!!!"
1,"I came here on a Saturday night and had a really good time.  Our service was fast, friendly, and it was overall a great experience.  The short ribs were unbelievably tender, and I also enjoyed 'the tower' appetizer.  Some of the best non-traditional hushpuppies I've ever had!"
0,"The service here is horrible. Took forever for our mini pizzas to get to us and when they arrived, it was nothing special. The staff barely pays attention to you; we were there for 2 hours (45 minutes spent waiting on those pizzas) and I think she came by only twice.  We had to flag her down where she was standing across the bar hugging on some other dude (employee or customer, idk) just to get our bill.  Truly another disappointing experience. I've been to this location 4 times and it's just not worth it."
1,"The great thing abotu Red Rock is that it's far enoguh from The Strip to be free of crowds and touristy nonsense. I don't gamble or anything like that, but I do frequent the movies here and, on occasion, the bowling alley. You can usually count on no crowds here. We walked up to Harry Potter 7.0 on opening night and got great seats for four."
0,"If you are into partying and insanity, this is the place for you.\n\nIf you are over 25 and want to enjoy Las Vegas, this is NOT the place for you.\n\nWe ate at several places in Cosmo so we were in here often but we just went in to eat and left.  Freaking insane!   People were falling down drunk, people were half naked (and not in a good way), and we saw arrests on several occasions.  \n\nLeave Cosmo to the teeny boppers and head over to Aria or anywhere else for that matter."
0,I came here eons ago when it first opened and still wonder about it's success. I really didn't like it. Shabu-Shabu is supposed to taste much better than this.
1,"My first time at a Carrabba's and it surprised me in quality and service.\n\n The dough wasn't good for the pizza, and instead of serving sub par stuff to my friend the GM came out and explained what happened and offered any other entree. It was classy and put a restaurant that can get mixed in with other mid-grade italian places that extra star. We came on Wine Wednesday and had the Sangria which was delicious."
0,"Envy is consistent.  Great food, great service and never a wait.\n\nedit: I had to go from 5 stars to 1.  Envy got a new chef last year, the menu has changed and the food is just not good.  :-("
0,"Decided to try lunch as it was close to my home.  Went in and was surprised to get both fried rice and chow mein, instead of having to choose one.  Also, went there for dinner, it was good.  My complaint was I ordered the large party trays for my sons b-day party.  I spent almost $200 and was not given anything extra such as crab puffs, egg rolls, etc.  NOTHING!!  When I ordered party trays from Jacky Chan, they gave me crab puffs, which are my favorites.  We haven't been to Rice n noodle, since and never will.  We aren't asking for hand-outs, but when we spend a couple hundred, include something extra, even a fortune cookie would have sufficed, but nothing gets you NO MORE OF OUR BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Great Brunch in Vegas.  sit out on the patio over the strip and people watch
1,"Love this place! Not fancy, but a great neighborhood place that's always clean, prices are good, and the staff is always friendly. The gyro pita is tasty and loaded with plenty of meat to fill you up.  Their baklava is awesome too! JT is right around the corner from my father-in-law's place, so I make sure to get my gyro fix every time I'm in town."
0,Well here I sit trying to escape the heat and humidity outside by indulging in some sushi. I started off with a bowl of hot and sour soup. Plenty of both hot and sour in this bowl. Plus I can draw out eating it while waiting for the sushi to appear. I ordered a variety of sushi this time instead of just salmon nigiri. the waitress Winnie seems to think that when I say that I want 10 orders of salmon nigiri that I am really saying that I want 10 pieces of salmon nigiri or 5 orders. I was not very happy about that revision to my order.\n\nI have been to this restaurant a number of times & as much as I hate to say it I don't see their sushi improving.I think this will be my last visit for awhile.
1,"Who knew you could get a delicious meal on the strip for such a great price.   Not tucked far back in a casino, but litterally steps from the Strip.   You order and then seat yourself, but you get real dishes and silverware (classy).  The food comes out fast, and tastes good (almost the best pizza that I have had from these gourmet pizza places popping up everywhere).  What's not to like?  Once word gets out, perhaps there will not be enough seating?"
1,"Wow what a lounge! My hubs and i while on vacation made it a point to do and see as much as we could. In doing so we probably drank more than we should,as we walked around the city we would stumble upon a place that looked cool so we would take a break and have a drink. \n\n   Le Lab was one of those places. we walked in on a Thursday at 10pm. I was so surprised that we were the only people in the bar. That lasted for about an hour and then it became a popping tiki-esque lounge. The cocktails we had were out of this world awesome. The choice of bitters alone was staggering. Ever flavor imaginable, which made for some pretty terrific cocktails. My favorite drink had to be the jerky Lab Jack, featuring a base of Jack Daniels, BBQ bitters or mist, and a small clothes line featuring a sizable piece of beef jerky. \n\n    I also had the pleasure of having an award winning mint julep made by the man who won the title. It was absolutely phenomenal and exactly the cocktail to enjoy amid the humidity of summer. \n\n   While there we also had the opportunity to talk to one of the owners/investors, Daniel. Who was one of the sweetest and coolest dudes we met while on our travels. He filled us in on the top places to grab a drink. We talked about the differences between the city of Montreal and Toronto. The latter may just be our future home. \n\n  I am so glad we stopped in, and if you ever find yourself in the area you should stop in too!"
1,We had a work function in Scottsdale so we decided to have a late lunch/early dinner.  I was surprised when we walked in and found all the tables full but one. We were happy to take the last one. The decor has an island feel complete with the music and decor. The beer was very reasonably priced and there was a great selection. I opted for the coconut porter which was yummy. \nWe ordered the chili con Fritos appetizer which took a while to come but it was worth the wait. The chili was good and just spicy enough. I opted to the special burger a bacon blue cheese burger. I ordered it on the brioche bun but it came on the pretzel bun instead. I'm going to call this a happy accident because I loved it. \nThe service was a little slow but it was really busy in there. The food was reasonably priced and very tasty. I would definitely return and may be dreaming of that pretzel bun..
1,"I, for one, LOVED their tiramisu! Sure, the whipped cream was a mile high, but c'mon... it's served in an edible chocolate cup! IT'S VEGAS! GO BIG OR GO HOME! The cake to custard ratio was just right for me, not being a huge fan of the rum flavor in most tiramisu desserts.\nWhen I'm back I definitely have to try out something else because the presentation of their goodies ALONE is enough to make you want to try everything!"
0,"A new menu, tried the steak, onion panini with horseradish. Pretty good but a little overcooked. However, they found a zillion ways to mess up my kid's meal. I asked for a salad instead of the yogurt, seemed simple enough of a request. They made a huge salad, enough that I said \""Is that what goes with the kids meal to replace the yogurt or fruit?\"" got to the counter, paid and noticed that they charged me for a regular salad, then for a kid drink which used to be included, then for a kid's meal. Got the manager, explained the failure to communicate and he refunded the salad price. My daughter jokingly said \""as long as they didn't forget my cookie\"". See she wasn't concerned about the vegetable to carb ratio or the dairy problem. Then the lady behind the counter slips me a cookie all clandestine-like. We sit down and I unpack the bag to discover they gave us a whole sandwich instead of the 1/2 for a kids meal, no biggie but a waste and not what the menu said, then they gave us fruit and yogurt. She had slipped us the cookie because apparently she realized they had the WHOLE order wrong. For kids that can't have dairy, a salad or fruit substitute shouldn't be rocket science. Everything else was classic Paradise and the manager made it right, but it was a hassle, a waste of time and food."
0,The food is not good and the prices are high. A soda is $4.99. The prices are higher than a dinner house. Oh and if you only drink water they also charge $.75 for that.  Definitely would not go back
0,Not bicycle friendly.
0,"Have used for about a year.  Initially was very satisfied.  The girls are all super friendly.  Office manager is obviously in over her head.  Would agree on a time, only to have them show up 3 hours early.  Scheduled an appt 2 months in advance.  Called an hour after they were to arrive to say they were on the way.  Mop around rugs, don't mop under kitchen  table.  A few times they left 30 minutes early.  Sent 3 girls for one hour, when I paid for 2 hours, office manager claimed \""she did right by me\"" I  Have decided to no longer use this service"
0,"I don't know when the hair \""stylists\"" here lost the passion for their work, but it's long gone. I came in saying I don't like a certain hair shape, and that's exactly what I was given. I asked for my bangs to not look like they were cut straight across, which she had done, and now they're shorter than I asked. All the while her complete blas\u00e9 attitude demonstrated how little she actually cared about my experience or results."
0,"Chances are you've found this review because you've looked up prices for hotels in Las Vegas and Imperial Palace was the cheapest. That's what I did. I ignored the reviews because it was cheap and I just needed a place to stay. You could sum up Imperial Palace much the same way:  it's cheap and it's a place to stay. \n\nIf you're looking for luxury during your trip to Vegas, check elsewhere. Anywhere else. There are nicer rooms at hotel chains like Motel 6 than there are at Imperial Palace. This is an old casino that has seen a lot of traffic. The carpets in the hallways smell like smoke, the furniture has stains, and the amenities are sparse. My wife and I stayed in a room where the bathroom tub didn't drain, a common complaint among reviews. Someone came up to our room to \""fix\"" the problem which was just to take the  stopper out of the tub entirely. It was a cheap fix but it worked, so there's that. \n\nHowever, the location is beyond ideal. You're smack-dab in the center of the strip and you can easily stumble home after a night's partying. Just be warned that the parking is absolutely terrible so once you do manage to get your car parked, you are going to want to keep it in the garage for the majority of your stay. If you're just planning on walking the strip though, this isn't a problem at all. Another word of warning:  do not try to check-in beyond 7PM. You'll be waiting for hours.\n\nBottom line:  stay here if you just need a room and don't want to spend too much money. Personally I'd spend the extra cash and get something nicer."
0,"Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed!\n\n I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!!\n\n For my first course i had the \""Baked Beans\"" as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....\n\nOnly good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!"
1,"This is by far the best nail spa in Las Vegas. I have been here in Vegas for 3 yrs now, and it took me at least 2 yrs to find someone to do my nails good. Peter is my nail technician now and he truly is awesome. I can go 3 weeks before I get a fill and they still look good. Love u guys at CC Nail Spa..... Always so nice. :)\n\nOh and by the way, I had just walked in when Jennel was having her issue with her \""$100\"" gift card. I felt sorry for the manager trying to deal with her. She wasn't making any since and they were really trying to fix the situation even after all her attitude. Props to them. And they honored what she claimed. I say that is good customer service :)"
0,"So disappointed ! We read the reviews and headed over, thinking about Lobster Tacos.\n\nParking was a nightmare, poor signage for those of us from out of town. Strolled the grounds looking for the entrance to the resturant, beautiful grounds with all the Christmas lights maned carousel.  The aromas in the air as we entered we so inviting. \n\nThe hostesses were very friendly, but seem surprised we'd be there to dine when we weren't staying there.  Sat us right away, in the corner by the kitchen. The hostess was the only staff we ever spoke with.  Water was poured then we sat and sat and sat and sat.  After 10 minutes (maybe a little more) we hadn't received a \""Hello\"" \""I will be right with you\"" or any kind of greeting so we left.\n\n Perhaps if we'd been a guest at the Fairmont we would have had better service and we would of had the opportunity to experience the Lobster Tacos others rave about."
0,"While in Sedona, AZ, we stopped at Wendys and two of us ordered the Ciabatta Bacon Cheeseburger; it was awesome. Soooo, 6 days later while close to home I decided to stop at the local Wendys, ordered the same Ciabatta Bacon Cheesburger to split between 2 people. I was highly disappointed. Didn't look or taste like the first one -- half the size and no taste. I will probably go as far as to stop to talk to the manager sometime in the near future."
0,"I have been to this restaurant a few times.  Every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance (my workout exercise).  Every Saturday night, they have salsa, bachata music for a few hours.  We normally got there early at around 9 pm.  Right, the customers had never been close to ten each time.  I always like to have red wine, desert and snack.\nThe crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.  There were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thro'.  People are drinking and dancing within the limited place. Doubted if they just love that jostling feel.\nNormally once I see the crowd, we will start to leave.  There are always police around the parking lot.\nOn a Saturday last month, without knowing they called celebration of Columbia night, we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.  Out of my surprise, they charged $15.- per person just to get in.  No drink, no nothing.  It was my friend who did not want to upset the party, he paid for it.  What?  $60.- to just get into the crowd with no seats.  Later he found some friends who gave us a few seats.  Honestly I was not happy at all.\nThe floor is carpet.  Price of the drink is above average.\n\nI talked with many of my friends, everyone said $15.- entrance is outraged.  Even I never have to pay, I still consider not a place for me.  I know they do charge for entrance, check out before you go unless you do not mind."
0,"The worst customer service you could ever imagine!  I read the reviews and still bought a groupon because they are so close by our home.   They refused to accept our groupon because their computers were allegedly down upgrading their groupon program.  Their cashier Tereasa  had plenty of attitude in telling us that there was no way possible to redeem our groupon, so we had to pay full retail price instead!  She wrote a messy note for us to walk out and get our car back from the line of cars being washed!  She did not have a phone number for her manager, so we had to just chalk this one up as another failed effort for consumers to use a groupon at Danny's."
0,"This is just a message regarding feedback on the store. I'm not sure that it will matter or that someone will even read it and care. But I feel I must as I stayed up until 3am last night doing research on Living Spaces. \n\nI discovered LS while googling this past weekend for new furniture. I went in the Phoenix location yesterday and spent at least 2 hours there-the place is beautiful! I've never seen anything like it, either. I was immediately greeted and told that the employees don't work on commission. That's fine, but I didn't ask so I'm not sure why I was told. Well if I was a betting woman, I'd put everything I have that they DO in fact work on commission because they won't leave you alone while you're there! OMG, it was ridiculous. Every 5 seconds someone was asking if I needed help. When I said no, they would proceed to ask me what I was shopping for, if they could show me something specific, etc. NO, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE MY GOD! There was one woman (think she was a designer-foreign accent) that was basically trying to force me to use the free design services. I am a pretty skilled designer and don't need it but she wouldn't stop talking about it every time she came up, which was at least 10 times during my experience there. There has GOT to be some other sales incentive because I was pestered more than I've ever been, even when car shopping. They need to BACK.OFF. \n\nSo I continued to shop because most of the items are exactly how I'd want my house to look. I even took pictures of everything I liked so I could narrow it down and buy. I only came for a couch/sectional but found a bed I liked and was going to buy it too. When I left I was so excited that I called my husband in the parking lot. \n\nLater that evening, I googled Living Spaces and my screen was full of nothing but complaints. Literally, I hadn't seen a single positive review unless it was by someone who I would bet money on works there. SO fabricated-technical terminology, straight out of a commercial-sounding. Terrible experiences once furniture is paid for, it's like Jekyll and Hyde. Furniture being delivered broken, damaged, deliveries not showing up at all, showing up at wrong times, taking days, weeks, in some cases months longer than stated. Repairs taking MONTHS. Items being delivered back in the exact shape they were picked up, without repairs being made. Literally being told that \""it's not our problem\"" when customers contact you with issues. Lastly, the absolute refusal from LS employees to allow customers to speak to managers. \n\nNow I'm back at square one, trying to find a good furniture store. You'll be closing your doors faster than you opened them if these reviews keep pouring in. Such a shame...well, I doubt I'll hear back from anyone but I feel better walking away with my several thousand dollar purchase I was going to make...\n\nUPDATE: against my better judgement, we've purchased a few items from LS. We had 2 rules-it had to be in stock and ready for purchase and WE would bring it home, not their delivery service. I actually feel sorry for this company because it's not going to survive due to their customer \""service\"" call center. They refuse to let you talk to the individual stores when you call. They're like Ft Knox. There is NOTHING you can say or do to talk to the actual store you shop in. We wanted a bed but apparently it's constantly out of stock (according to the employee there). He said they never have it but continue to display it. He stated to call back on a certain day and they'd have it-we could call and pay and pick up. Well, the call center refused to let us talk to the store and said it's not possible to pay on the phone. No less than 5 phone calls and hours later, we were in the same boat. They assured us they wouldn't sell out because the store \""just got 50 of them\"". Went to buy it yesterday and guess what? Sold out. Shocker. Mind you this is an hour drive one way for us. We couldn't find out over the phone as we couldn't talk to the store. Huge cluster f*ck of a store. Mind=blown."
1,"Being from WA, I would always have friends who travel to this area often recommend this place. You can't beat cheap, good eats, right!?\n\nSo of course, my last visit to Vegas we came here. Needless to say, the burger was pretty good! Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries (my preference is still Dick's fries up in Seattle!) but I would certainly come here again when I'm in the area!"
0,"Let me just say that ever since I attended the grand opening of XS in 2009, Tryst has been a thing of the past.  I recently came back here again for a friend's birthday during CES week (which equated to SUPER crowded, but with old geeks in suits).  \n\nThe line extends all weird ways into the hotel public areas and lobby.  Someone actually has to keep people that are standing in line from blocking the hotel check-in entry way.\n\nThe entrance reeks of puke.  The back bar smells like sewage.\n\nConclusion:  XS is the best thing that has happened to the Wynn properties."
0,"Nice place with modern flair, and excellent hours.  This place is right near where I work so I was very excited to give it a try.  It just doesn't do it for me.  Another review said their espresso drink tasted more like a steamer, and I had the same experience.  I tried the carmella latte, and it was pretty much all syrup, very little espresso.  I couldn't finish it because it was so sweet.  Service was also very slow.  I think if they can work on the product a bit more, this place could be great."
0,I hate to write a bad review about this place but it just isn't that good. I fully recommend this place for drinks and appetizers. Great salsa and guacamole but thats about it. \n\nThe dinner entrees are overpriced and average at best. There is nothing on the menu that sticks out as being great. There are too many other places in this city that are better. \n\nI do not recommend this place for dinner. Drinks and appetizers only.
1,"Visit #1: I ate here for breakfast and immediately felt welcomed and at home by the staff. I ordered the french toast and a scrambled egg on the side. At first I was alarmed by what I considered to be \""small\"" portions. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was! Everything was just right and I left satisfied and not stuffed.\n\nVisit #2: I ate here on a Friday night when they offer 2 specials - Prime Rib and Fried Catfish. I had the prime rib and my fiance had the catfish. You get prime rib, a baked potato, veggies, and a slice of bread for $12.99. Just like my breakfast experience everything was excellent! The waitress was very nice and took good care of us. Chef Willie even came out to check on us and say hello. I got a slice of white chocolate strawberry swirl cheesecake - YUM. It made me think of the Cheesecake Factory but better. Again the portions were the right size so I didn't feel stuffed when I left.\n\nGo down to the B & G Cafe for some wonderful food and great hospitality. Important lesson learned is you don't need a large quantity of food when Chef Willie prepares QUALITY food."
0,"I really like Red Velvet Cafe on Sahara and I've been going there for years now. Though, I have to say that this location is not ideal. I picked up a croissant sandwich to go and it was soggy and falling apart when I went to eat it. Luckily the tiramisu cupcake I got is just as good as the cupcakes they have at their other location. I really want to support this business and would give them a higher rating, but I feel the quality seems to suffer here. Hopefully in the future they'll work out the kinks and I'll gladly write an updated review!"
0,"Sucks, sucks, sucks.  Music sucked, crowd sucked, lines sucked... there were lines to get everywhere.  Even to go down the fucking stairs to get OUT of the place.  I'm so glad I didn't pay to get in this hellhole.  We left after enduring a 25 minute wait at the bar for a round of drinks.  From what I saw, it is a place the Ed Hardy-wearing, Escalade-driving, breast-implant-having throngs enjoy the most.  GROSS"
0,"I stopped in today since I was driving by. I was seated immediately by a friendly young lady. I had plenty of time to look over the happy hour menu. Seven minutes after being seated I still had not been offered a glass of water or drink. As I was walking out I noticed what must have been the chef and a majority of the wait staff huddled in the corner. Hope your meeting was worth it, because you have lost my business for good. No plans to return."
0,"Being that it was located in the Bass Pro Shop I had expected more from this restaurant. It was okay, but not the best place to go for fish. I had scallops, shrimp & linguini in a lobster sauce. The portion was large, though it only came with three shrimp and three scallops. My date had their specialty fried fish sandwich. The sandwich and coleslaw were lacking in flavor. It wasn't bad, but there are definitely better places to go for fish."
0,"This restaurant is next to the hotel where I was staying.  Even though the Yelp reviews were mostly unfavorable, I went against my fellow yelpers and ordered what I thought would be a safe/no brainer dish - Veggie Spaghetti. \n\nDang..... I don't know what the heck went wrong but it had a horrible \""off\"" taste and I couldn't eat it.  If I hadn't already changed into my comfy clothes kicked back ready to eat, chill and watch tv, I would have taken back the Spaghetti in it's entirety. Dang, it was BAD !  The salad was good, so that was my dinner.  I would NOT go back here.   Minus Stars for the Veggie Spaghetti, 2 starts for the Salad."
0,"If I could give negative stars, I would! I bought some swim trunks here for my husband for over $60. The fit is super small so they didn't fit and when I tried to exchange them within one day of receiving them, they would not do an exchange or return. This place is a total scam and now I am stuck with swim trunks that are too small. I will never buy anything with Frank and Oak again. I highly recommend avoiding this company!"
1,"This place c ame as a top recommendation from a former Montrealer; I read about it and was a little wary of going to a \""retro lounge\"" but took the plunge and headed there one night.\n\nThe decor is actually really neat; it does retro without being corny, and I found myself aweing over their hand chairs, in love with the light fixtures, and captivated over several different items from the bar to the booths to the art. \n\nDrink service was fast, the DJ was playing all the best songs, and the patrons were very social and friendly. I could have gone here everynight I was in Montreal and been happier than a pig in mud."
1,The food was delicious.  The crispy potatoes pancakes with the sauce are so yummy. The braised beef with cabbage and sauteed vegetables are juicy and plump. The hurricane drink is a panty dropper. You dont notice how strong it is until your already gone. Lol.. great food. Great service...
1,I am not really a fan of greek food especially tzatziki so I ordered the chicken gyro and asked for it on the side.  by itself the gyro stood out as having the best I have ever had and the tzatziki put it over the top.  the fries where really flavorful as well.  my parents ordered the gyro salad which we both agree was sensational.  we are originally from Chicago which has a huge Greek community and my mom said it was the best Greek food she has tried outside of Chicago.  it has never let me down and is the only great place I will go to.
1,Quick service. Food was served fresh and hot..We're still looking for that perfect chinese Loved the BBQ pork and pot stickers.
0,"Of all the times I've been to Vegas, I finally got to remember what Playboy Club looks like.\n\nI did not realize they had actual game tables there.  With dealers in Playboy uniforms.  Hawt.\n\nNothing else memorable.  No eye candy besides the workers.  Kind of disappointing."
0,"Went here because my friend wanted to try their famous frozen hot chocolate. It was so not worth it. He loves chocolate and he did not find the drink very appealing. \n\nWe actually sat and at lunch there. I order the chicken pot pie and it was very salty. I couldn't even finish it. My friend ordered an omelet, which was humongous. I think he liked it, but didn't finish it because he wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate. \n\nOverall I would say that everyone should at least try this place once to see it's not all that. The food is overpriced and the desserts are not good."
0,Good food but not worth dealing with the horrible service.
1,"I never thought about writing a review for this place since its inside of another place, but might as well.  100% agree with Jane Q.P.  Delicious coffee for a reasonable price at great location."
1,"Who doesn't love vegas?   \n\nWho didn't want to be a rock star for just a little bit? \n\nParty like a Rock star at the Hard Rock!!   Here for a bachelor party, we had one of the most amazing suites I've been in.   ( I shant give away the secret location.. so don't ask) \n\nI won't go into the pool, or views, or anything like that because if you can't imagine a vegas pool (ie Rehab)... you should either book your flight today or join a convent.   \n\nThe VIP staff and hosts were simply amazing.   Mike F.  and Trehy really hooked us up when going to the club.  Six bottles and an entire corner to ourselves later - we had an amazing night.   I truly have to give it to our waitress, Rachel, for what became one of the most memorable nights ever.   I would never go here again if I wasn't able to have her to hang out with.  (She was genuine, funny and beautiful)   \n\nThe actually \""casino\"" is a bit small, but what do I care - I only play craps.   \n\nAlthough there was no Buffett at the hotel, they did have an \""all you can eat\"" tapas restaurant which wasn't bad.   \n\nPink taco - the mexican place - was really really good!!!   Although the computer went down, the waitress forced us to go to the ATM - PAY THE FEE - so that we had to pay her in cash.....  Which was complete BS. \n\nBut you're in vegas, and several ... (several)....  thousand dollars later - this was by far the best vegas trip I have ever had.   - and i have been there more than a dozen times."
1,This has become our regular spot when in town if for no other reason than the wonderful outdoor space.  The food has always been great - although more vegetarian options would be welcomed by the wife - and the margaritas are sublime.  Service has always been fine but we do arrive early before it gets crazy packed.  (Old people style has its benefits.)
0,"Food is delicious. However the service is terrible. We had a reservation. When we arrived, tables were available but we weren't seated for 10 minutes. It was another 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. Water was not provided until our food came. We never received a bread basket. Same story when waiting for the bill. We were completely ignored. It would have been better just to have ordered from the to-go window."
1,Visiting from out of town. This was the only crossfit gym near where I was staying. The owners were very nice and encouraging since I have only been doing crossfit for about a month. Would highly recommend this gym.
0,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but what people should know about this place is NO MORE 25 CENT CHICKEN WINGS.\n\nThat's right.\n\nNormally, that fact alone wouldn't justify a 1-star review. But everything else was just horrible. We came here expecting our beloved, delicious 25-cent wings that we've been coming for for years, only to be told that this was discontinued 2 months ago. Now you can have 10 wings and fries for 8 dollars. Whatever, we'd come here all the way from the Venetian and we were hungry. The fact that there was no wait, like there usually is, should have tipped us off. \n\nThe restaurant was dirty and had sticky tables. I don't know why I did, but I ordered the fried calamari, which came out burned-looking and the calamari chewy, rubbery, and gross. I couldn't even have my friends try them because I didn't want to make more than one person ill. The waitress never asked why I hadn't touched my plate, or offered anything else.\n\nMy friend also had the \""worst chicken fingers she'd ever had,\"" consisting of mostly bread. There really wasn't any saving grace to this place at all.\n\nI felt bad for raving about this place and taking my friends here, and also for telling everyone else I knew about it. I loved this place and their amazing wing deals for years, and am sad that I can't come back. Dan Marino would be ashamed, too."
0,"I've had Cafe Boa over the years and have never been too enthusiastic about their food.  Last night I gave them another chance and it really will be the last time I go back unless it is only for drinks/appetizers for happy hour.\n\nI had the seafood ravioli which consisted of five or six small raviolis filled with a mix of seafood.  They were not stuffed full of seafood, they had some seafood.  The sauce was overpoweringly salty and just didn't taste great for the $22 price.  I had initially thought that the price would mean it would be tasty and be of decent proportions.  I should have remembered my previous experiences with this place.  You do not get what you pay for here.  \n\nThe wine was decent (Malbec from Napa) and the appetizer was small and overpriced as well.\n\nNever say never, but I'm really trying to say never again to Cafe Boa."
1,"We came here for dinner while staying at the cosmopolitan hotel. The place is clean, hip, and big! The food is fresh and tasty. The options are ordinary for buffet though. We got there around 8:30pm mad were told that they are closing around 9:30 pm... Obviously, many dishes are no longer available, only few sushi piece left, no fish dishes, or king crab legs...\nThe desert on the other hand is very tasty... A lot of chocolate... \n\nThe reason I give this place 4 star is for the cleanliness, quality, and their desert bar!\nWould recommend to come early so that you can get all variety of dishes!\n$41 + tips per person for dinner is quite hefty!"
1,"I ate here about 2 weeks ago and the food was simply divine. It really does taste like something straight from New Orleans. I had the seafood gumbo (that comes with cornbread) and the alligator bites. The alligator bites are amazing, however, it might be the only overpriced thing on the menu ($10 appetizer). The seafood gumbo was dee-licious! For dessert, I had the bread pudding! AMAZING! I had a mimosa to drink with my meal. I was visiting from NJ and was extremely pleased with the food. The service was equally wonderful. I had a waitress named Stephanie who is an enabler haha! But I'm glad she convinced me to get the bread pudding. This place has good food, great service, and is priced right. Def check it out. You won't be disappointed!"
1,"Why did I just find out about this place? Wow. It's awesome!\n\nWent out on a date here, and having never been here assumed it would be another hole-in-the-wall that some people from certain dating sites like to take me to, ahem. I was bracing myself for the worst when I saw my VERY cute date AND this very cool restaurant. I'm sure you know how the rest of this goes. \n\nWalked in and the wait was kind of long and there were a lot of empty tables so not sure what the hold up was, but we waited anyway. \n\nFinally got seated outside on the patio. It was a really nice night so the patio was a perfect place to be. We sat VERY close to the people behind us, but we were so engrossed in conversation that we didn't really notice much. The misters were on over head and we weren't quite under them so we got a little wet. We asked about it and they kindly turned them off. \n\nOur server was quick and very nice. The beer is some of the best I've ever had and would highly recommend going here for just that. \n\nI only had a salad, but the dressing was delicious! It was fresh and cold and hit the spot after flying across the country earlier that evening. \n\nI'm going to go back and try some more beer and food soon!"
0,"Second time we went and they were not making things listed on their menu.  Went specifically for their heavily promoted Crepe Cake, but they didn't feel like making it that day.  Won't go back to be disappointed again."
0,"I actually love Hash House, believe it or not.  But this last experience was pretty horrible.  I went there with my girlfriend and daughter.  All the entrees had problems but I will only review mine.\n\nIt took 10 minutes for a server to stop by the table.  When he finally showed up, I showed him the restaurants.com certificate I had and he took the orders. I don't know if the certificate had anything to do with it, but we didn't see him again until the food arrived 25 minutes later.  This was slightly alarming since I realized in the interim he never asked me how I wanted the meat in my entree done.  \n\nDisinterested service aside, when the food arrived, it looked and smelled delicious.  I had the special, which was a mixed grill with duck breast, lamb chops and a boneless ribeye.  I soon realized however, why he didnt ask how I wanted it done.  The lamb chops were just medium, well prepared and tasted good.  However, the ribeye was only about a centimeter thick, and I'm thinking they could have cooked it for a minute on each side and it still would have turned out how I got it, which was well done, dry and flavorless.  Very disappointing for a cut of meat that is pretty easy to get right in my own experience.  \n\nThe duck had the skin left on which I was excited to see at first, until I realized they made no effort to crisp it at all.  It was so chewy I had to peel it off just to be able to eat the meat, which was now devoid of seasoning. \n\nThe best thing about the entree was the mashed potatoes.\n\nVery very disappointing experience considering what I've come to expect from Hash House, which is big, well prepared portions of delicious food."
1,"I liked this place. It was good, but I dont know if I would go back again because a) its still fairly pricey and b) I dont think you totally get your moneys worth. Our waiter was slow (very nice) but he seemed to just walk around and forget about us. We had two witch doctors, a good drink to get if you go there. The view is great, we sat in a booth facing outside and loved it. The food was pretty good. Not incredible, but pretty good."
0,"Two Words: Food poisoning.\nTo make matters worse, I encountered another couple a couple days later who also fell to food poisoning from this place.\n\nMy husband had a custom made quesadilla with chicken at 3 am. But 5 am he was sooo sick. We ruled out a hangover when the stomach cramps and other ever-so-lovely food poising symptoms kicked in. Normally I say by-gones-be-by-gones but after hearing this other couple suffer from the same location, there is sufficient evidence that this restaurant needs to review their food prep policies. \n\nWe have reported this to the manager hoping for a refund. We are in contact with corporate but I will be taking this to the state."
0,"i first checked out the website before going here, and the website gave me the impression this place was something waayy different from what it actually is. Total let down, i was expecting to ride some good rides, when actually this place is for kids.. i mean little kids. Only two rides you can consider adult friendly, and still were not all that impressive. the one big roller coaster is alright, but really short and the \""Flyer' is probably their best attraction. Would i go back?? prob not unless i took kids..if you have kids they would love it though."
1,Had an excellent espresso here this morning. They use locally roasted beans from wisconsin. A great vibe in a cool historic building in a residential neighborhood. A great hidden gem. If you like non chain local coffee shops this is a sure bet.
1,"Just came back from Vegas, and I have to say that it was an awesome weekend.  So me and a couple of buddies decide to roll to Vegas for my buddy's birthday.  Normally when I go to Vegas I make it a point to go to Hash House A Go-Go because I love their food.  Well, looks like there's a new candidate for my favorite spot to eat at when in Vegas.\n\nThe M Resort is off the strip, but regardless of that fact, it's a beautiful hotel.  It's nice, clean, doesn't smell too much like smoke (a plus if you've ever been in a Vegas casino), and best of all....the famous M Buffet, or Studio B Buffet!  I've heard about this place before from a lot of friends, so I pretty much knew that it'd be good food, but it wasn't until I was in the line grabbing my food that the awesomeness started settling in.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the seafood.  I'm asian so I love crab legs, oysters, and muscles.  Needless to say that was the first thing that I grabbed.  They also had so much meat!  Beef, chicken, pork, fish, etc.  If it wasn't extinct, then it was probably being served...haha!  Salads, ehh...not much of a salad person, but hey they had your typical salads, pasta salads, fruit salads, etc.  Pastries were awesome, as well as your regular kids foods like pizza, fries, chicken wings, etc.  I still get those!  The best part is....all you can DRINK beer and wine.  Yup, that's right!  Beer and wine is included in the price.  The desserts were really good too.  Everything I tried was just really good.  The gelato was pretty awesome too.  I thought I saw red velvet gelato and I almost cried tears of joy, but it turned out to be strawberry...I cried a little in the inside though...haha.  All in all, food galore!\n\nThis place exceeded my highest expectations.  I was a bit skeptical thinking that no buffet was worth $30, when I could just go to other buffets that are like $15.  I was definitely proven wrong.  I paid $30 for a buffet that was worth every single cent.  This is a place that I'm definitely going to go to everytime I'm in Vegas.  So check it out for yourself.  It's not that far of a drive from the strip.  It's a beautiful, classy hotel with some bomb food.  Last bit of advice, go there hungry, and I mean like Calista Flockhart type hungry cause you'll definitely want your money's worth."
1,"I am glad I didn't read reviews on yelp (I hear the bump up and down restaurants depending on ads).\n\nI have to say that the restaurant in fact is expensive, but nothing completely ridiculous as my husband and I have eaten in restaurants in Santa Barbara with less food and less taste.\n\nI am a pescetarian, so I ordered the sweet and sour fish, the fish filet with black been sauce and the white egg and shrimp fried rice, tea, and white rice (about $90)... needles to say, it was very good, and the fish was very fresh. So, my mom and I came back a second time for lunch.\n\nMy mom had the soup, same white eggs and shrimp fried rice and I had the Thai style noodle sea food (which is suppose to be just seafood and curry sauce)... when they brought the noodle it had pork! But they were nice to give us a plate without pork... it took a while, so we ended up taking it to go.\n\nI am sure you can find great Chinese food for less with equal amount of taste, but it was convenient for us as we were staying at Caesar's Palace."
0,I wasn't impressed with this place at all!! When I walked in the girl at the front desk was eating and they didn't have my appointment in the computer. They were able to fit me in so I walked back to the chair and there was hair all over the floor and there seemed to be piles of clutter everywhere. The towels were stained & ripped. Then they did one of my least favorite things where they try to do two clients at once.  Which never works out well and your appointment always takes forever. My color turned out ok but I wasn't impressed with the cut. She started to blow dry my hair but then said she didn't have time to finish it. I tried this place because I bought a groupon for the cut & color but I won't be going back. Thankfully I hadn't paid full price for this appointment.
1,"I'm seriously obsessed with this place. Whenever I come to Vegas I make my friends go with me like 5 times. The chicken salad is the best ever. And I saw someone say that she was upset that her bread was so thick but they slice each piece as they need it and there's a sign that says to ask for your bread sliced thin so if that's what you're about, just ask them."
0,"We were just at coyote ugly and had an absolutely horrible experience. We went to the washroom and then the bouncer Martin Hampton would not let us back in. No one is an angel in vegas, but we were clearly not out of control. He claimed we  were and we are parents at almost 50 years of age with three boys. I don't know what they were up to, but they ruined our evening. When you are wrong, that is fine, but this situation baffles me. Don't you want business? and i write this note in the clearly inebriated state that they assessed me at? \n\nAVOID"
1,"This spot is definitely good by me for decent cheap lunch eats. Lunch for two with two lunch specials, a soda, and a thai iced tea was under 20 bucks.\n\nGot to try the Thai BBQ chicken and beef skewers. BBQ chicken was nice and sweet and moist. The beef skewers were good-could have been a little better-they seemed a little chewy. \n\nThe rice that came alongside was nice and not greasy (ashamed to admit that I have had greasy rice in a Thai place before...don't know how that happened)\n\nThai iced tea was probably one of the best ones I've had! When it is too sweet I can't deal-this one was a nice balance. \n\nOverall atmosphere was decent-smelled like thai, everyone was clean, and there were some booths along the walls. Will definitely return, hopefully with the same awesome company I went there with the first time!"
0,"They are only good for washing you car and THATS IT! Just paid $40 to have my headlights restored but now it has more scratches on it than before.  I asked the guy over to redo it 4 times and he finally said thats the best he can do.  They only use one rough sand paper and no fine sanding to sand out the fine scratches.  Sh*tty-est piece of so called \""professional\"" work I've seen.  NEVER AGAIN!"
0,"Although the price is right and the fried rice is pretty good, it's severely overshadowed by the \""off\"" taste of the beef and chicken dishes.  The beef with scallion is 90% bamboo shoots, which isn't even listed as an ingredient, and the dumplings are incredible hulking globs."
1,First this place is no longer Hair Masters its a Super Cuts. I found this place here on Yelp since my hubby works just up the street. I was in DESPERATE need of a color so I popped in ( they only take walk ins) Anyways the wait was long but they were super busy. I figured it was a good sign. I sit down tell the stylist what color I wanted and she went to work. The color came out like I wanted and much better than I thought it was going to since I bleached my hair last summer(I know what was I thinking??!) Anywho the ladies that work there are friendly and have open convos about everything...and I do mean everything so I wouldnt bring the kid like I did. Thankfully her Dad was there to take her out to lunch. The whole thing took about 2.5 hours and was only 49 bucks!! So all in all I liked it and am happy with my hair. The only negative thing I can say is the stylist put some kind of waxy based stuff in my hair and it took 3 washes to get
0,"I had high expectations for La Condesa, but it quickly turned to La Confusi\u00f3n. The three of us went in during the week for a late lunch, salivating at the thought of some tasty tacos. We each ordered a different  taco combo plate, one Aztec Tinga, one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken,  one Baja Sur Dogfish Shark, and a quesadilla. \nAfter waiting a significant amount of time, the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one Aztec Tinga taco and one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken taco. Despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen, somehow, what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension. They brought out the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco combo plate and, after waiting so long and confusion over our order, we gave up and ate what we had.\nThe Azteca Tinga was superb. The Oaxaca Black Mole was good. The Baja Sur Dogfish wasn't really any better than your average fish taco. The rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans.\nLa Condesa has a great salsa bar, a cozy interior decorated with some great D\u00eda de los Muertos art. The staff was nice and friendly, despite the fact our order remained so elusive.\nBut, after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal, I have to say that La Condesa was an utter disappointment."
0,Abuelo's is OK. There is nothing fantastic about it. I ordered the Juarez. I asked that the cheese enchilada be beef instead. I was told it would be no problem. That did not happen. It came out cheese. I sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice. Run of the mill service. If you come here just know you're walking into a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.
1,"Sorry I have to write a review for this, but I am not able to find the hours this location is open. Does anyone have that information???  :)  Thank you in advance!"
0,Warning! Had the foie grass dish. Worst ever. Do not order this. Asked to have it redone and they brought the same platter. Do not order. This is junk.
0,"It smelled like toilet in the lobby and the room we got was really small. Their room service food was not good at all. I know that room service is pricey anywhere but if I order a berry shake, please don't give me berry soup. The bathroom was nice but I think all bathrooms in Vegas are nice. It was a place to crash and convenient too since we went to Light and Daylight but I think I'd trade in the convenience for a nicer room."
1,"We have rented a property for two years under the managment of this company.  He has been responsive to all of our phone calls, emails and txt's.  We have had several issues in the two years on our rental property and he has responded to them all.  We have appreciated his managment of our lease and would recommend him to our friends."
1,"Every time I go to Vegas, I have to eat here!  The sushi is amazing and the staff is great!  I love the half price sushi if you come in late!"
1,"Yogurt flavors are really tasty-peppermint, oatmeal cookie and nonfat chocolate all tasted incredible with the consistency of yogurt thick and flavorful. This really beats Yogurtini and or one of the chains with silky smooth yogurt with no taste! We will be back again!"
1,"One of my favorite restaurants of all time.  I live in Albuquerque and get to Phoenix a few times per year and always have FnB as a place to go.  It's a casual and cozy atmosphere with great service and amazing food.  My favorite dish last visit was the Cauliflower, yes Cauliflower... it was sauted and had a Thai like sauce, wow!"
1,Great little airport. Now direct connection to Europe. Live piano music in terminal. Us airways hub. Rental car shuttles run every few minutes. Lots of charging stations for electronic devices. Airport is also small enough to make transfers easy.
0,"This was probably the worst Chinese food I've ever forced down.  The server brought out the fried rice first and my first thought was, \""Wow, they used a lot of pepper.\"" Well, it wasn't pepper.  It was burnt.  My guess is that they burned something in the wok before they cooked ours and didn't clean it out.  The lo mein was the same way and my wife couldn't eat it.  We had to send it back.  Later that night my wife was in pain from the food.  The price was reasonable for good food but this was anything but.  If I could give less than one star I would."
0,"Called in about 10:00 am for a breakfast burrito, and now at 5:00pm, I am still regretting it! It was the worst burrito ever!  I also got one for my son, and he agreed it was awful, he said it best, \""the best part of the burrito, was the end of it!  Since I was not able to finish my mine, because it was so bad,. I never did get to the best part!  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  SAVE YOUR $$ AND YOUR STOMACH THE PAIN ."
0,"I am not sure what the rave reviews are for since this is average at best. The yogurt was neither creamy or tart enough to be considered frozen yogurt to me. Sure they have a good variety of flavors but they were forgettable to say the least. I like the toppings bar they have, definitely covering all the bases. But for $0.49 an ounce? I will take my business elsewhere, only wanted to try the place out since I have never been to it before. Only thing I liked was that it was attached to Books A Million which had wifi."
1,"Breakfast was excellent, really on my top five lists of best breakfast joints anywhere.  The corned beef hash is great.  Portions were generous.  Service was attentive and friendly."
0,"CROOKS!!!!  LIARS!!! SCAM ARTISTS!!!  Say one thing about payment details and totally do another. In all my years writing reviews, never have I feel disrespected as a paying customer.  NEVER EVER AGAIN!!  And I am telling you prospective customer to simply AVOID at all cost.    Believe the prior reviews on this filth of a business.  My situation sounds JUST LIKE HEIDI M's review TO A TEE ...verbatim except i dealt with a lying NIKKO instead.  They are masters of the hidden charges deception.  And to add, I never got the original vehicle that I booked for.  Check my review resume on YELP, I rarely am this TICKED OFF in my analysis.  ABSOLUTELY THE WORST of the hundreds If not thousands of reviews I've written not only on this platform but others...and I will make sure the word gets out on these CHEATS!!!!!\n\nOh by the way, I will be filing a complaint to all necessary parties!!!!!!  Putting them on the SH*T LIST!!"
1,My sister actually found this place I think using Yelp! Thanks Yelp for helping us find this hidden treasure. This great little breakfast place is a little far for me to get to so sadly I actually haven't been back since my first time. \n\nIts a little hard to find because it is hiding behind a metro pizza joint. So you actually can't see it from the street! So as soon as you see the pizza place turn in! Go to the right and you'll see it from the side. \n\nIt is a small cozy little spot and actually is connected to the pizza place. We went for breakfast so we got there around 10:30-11am. I guess we missed the rush because there weren't too many people there which was good so we could take our time to look at the menu and check out the store. \n\nThere is fresh bread displayed and pastries when you go up to order and a small cooler that displays some of the menu options. \n\nI decided to go with their stuffed french toast. Strawberry and another fruit that I can't remember and it was AMAZING! I never ever have good luck with french toast every single time that I have ordered it I have always been disappointed. This time was a totally different story. It was so delicious and not overly sweet and just the right serving size! \n\nThey have an S shaped table that has outlets built into it so you can get some work done or just charge your phone! Very clever. \n\nThe service was excellent and the workers are so nice and I just love the homey feel this place exerts. \n\nThey also have cronuts on their menu but it is only offered on  a specific day I believe. You can also pre-order them! \n\nThanks for making my breakfast experience a delicious one!
0,"My husband and I stopped in last night for a small bite after a show (we had an early dinner at B&B, which was delicious). We split a pepperoni pizza and each had a cup coffee. Unfortunately, by the time we walked to the parking garage to drive home, we were both violently vommitting into a trash can. Something was obviously poorly prepared. We're still feeling ill from the food."
1,"Good food, good service, great ambiance."
0,"Extremely disappointed in this place. The one in Scottsdale is great. This location however not so much. \n\nGot a pan pizza and literally came out as bread and cheese. There was almost NO sauce on it and hardly any ingredients. It was cut into 4 giant slices, then everything fell off as I picked it up with a spatula! Not only that but on too of this, the pizza dough wasn't even cooked through all the way. Such a waste of money."
0,"I'm not really a buffet person, so just let me preface my review with that.\n\nI didn't really find much here I liked. The seafood seemed to be pretty popular but I'm not a seafood person. The mexican section was pretty sparse when I went up there but when my wife went she seemed to find more than i did. Just my luck :)\n\nI think I ate a few slices of microwave pizza and some breadsticks. The mashed potatos were pretty runny but they tasted all right. \n\nAmbience-wise, the place was pretty loud and filled with drunk people. Dinner was pretty pricey at $30/person"
0,Loved the atmosphere and they had a great selection of draft beers. But the food was just okay.
0,I really expected better. I have been waiting almost a year for something to fill the market space. I loved the phoenix market and was so sad when they lost their grant. They had the most amazing breakfast foods at an affordable price. I had great hopes when I found out that St. Francis was opening the public market cafe. \n\nI went this weekend. My friend and I had the breakfast sandwich and another friend had the fritatta. \n\nFirst of all it was overpriced. The sandwich came out on a HUGE plate. You could have fit 4 sandwiches on this large white plate but all that sat on it was my sandwich. Not so much as a piece of parsley to garnish and make necessary the enormous plate. \n\nMy friends fritata was way late because oatmeal came out instead of a fritatta. And instead of instantly rectifying the situation the server asked more than once if we were sure the oatmeal had not been ordered! \n\nThe bread looked spectacular but in reality it was not grilled/toasted/or warmed in any way and had the texture of stale bread. The sandwich lacked any real flavor and had to be doused in hot sauce. Now I love hot sauce but when I pay 10 bucks at a counter for a sandwich and a can of soda I expect that I won't NEED to use it.\n\nMy friend who ordered the fritatta also had to douse it in hot sauce. \n\nI kind of expected a lot more. I have a lot of breakfast options in downtown/midtown phoenix. I even have multiple options right at the market. Unless they get a handle on the food at the new cafe I won't be making this a regular event after the market.
0,"We had a party of 10.  We ordered appetizers and drinks first thing.  It took an hour.  We ordered food didn't get what we wanted.  They ran out of Lasanga. Basically the service was so bad that the manager had to come over.  When the food finally came out I had to get up and get plates.  Awful, awful.  \nAgain the manager came over and said that our meal was free including our alcohol drinks.  You know it's bad when a party of 10 had free food and alcohol. It just took 3 hours.  It was so annoying watching people being seated after us, then eat and then leave before we got our drink, our appetizers and main course."
0,"I wish I could put 5 stars .. Because the begining of my vacation was great ... We checked in late Saturday ... We chose Excaibur because my boyfriend loved staying there .. I couldn't argue the price was great .. So upon checking in we get a upgrade from a room with a view to a room with a hot tub .. I was beyond excited .. We were suppose to check out Monday morning . But we were having such a good time we decided to stay an extra night .... I was even planning to return in sept for my birthday .. But then it went down hill \n\nSome how the door managed to lock itself with the dead lock while we were out .. Took us 30 min to get someone to open it .. I tried not to think about it ... Any ways your probably wondering why I'm so upset .. So on the morning of checking out  I was packing my make up and one rolled underneath the chair .. I  kneel down and  what do I find ?? The hugest fatest cock roach I've ever seen ..  I almost though it could have been a beetle by the size of it ... I was so disgusted ... This thing  was here with us the last 3 nights .. My great memorable vacation was ruined ... All I could think of how dirty this room really was .. There's no way they could have missed this bug if it was cleaned properly ... I felt gross knowing I stayed in that bed , used that hot tub .. I was furious\n\n\nI went and notified management discreetly because i didn't want to call them out in front of other guests .. They apologized and offered to reimburse for one night that I stayed.... I didn't think that was enough But I bit my tounge ..  Now I'm driving home thinking about and although I do appreciate Excalibur for the reimbursement of one night .. I stayed for three days and still technically paid to sleep with a big dead bug ... I don't think I could come back and stay at this hotel"
0,"This is my first and last time coming here... I was up last night looking for fun cheap places to take my 3 year old. First of all I found 2 different times that were posted for the tiny tot gym time 9 and 9:30 I get her the poor girl at reception had no clue the lady in the back the same. So finally someone told me 9:30 so we waited 45 mins. Then finally we head back to the gym all they did was set out hoops, soccer nets, and balls. No teacher nothing. I could have done the same in my backyard without wasting gas. This place hit cheap on the head."
0,"My sister and I decided that we wanted sushi. We went to this place because it was close to our house and we had both of our kids. \n\nWe got there and the lady sat us and then attended to her other tables. We sat there for a good while staring at her waiting for menus. We had to ask another gentleman who also got us our waters.\n\nShe was very rude and when we asked for things like soup she would stare at us and walk away. \n\nShe only had two tables and barely came over to us. When we got our check we needed to split it as I was explaining what we wanted to do and she walked away. We couldn't understand her half the time because she was so quiet. \n\nTo be honest the sushi was mainly rice with barely any \""meat\"" to it. Out philly rolls were the tinest I have ever seen. \n\nTheir happy hour isn't even happy hour. Just a buy one get one special. \n\nI will not be spending my money here again."
1,"We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the \""outdoor\"" dining area.  We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.  \n\nFor our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal."
1,Great hot dog and sandwich place in my neighborhood. Nice little beer selection too. The fried pickles are good. Check this place out if your craving a good hot dog.
0,"Looking for a general contractor that cannot get the job done? Then this should be your first choice. Start with promises that cannot be met. These promises are for you to hear what you want at that time. Deadlines? He has no sense of what this is/means. Deadlines to his definition is when \""he\"" feels it can get done, more so when \""he\"" wants to get it done.  Your business suffers unimaginable loses waiting on completion. If things are not completed, then there is SOMEONE else to blame for that. No accountability for anything!!! Poor representation of a business owner."
0,"I was totally bored with everything in this place. The service was so so, the food was so so and unfortunately we didn't get a good view seat so the dining room was so so."
0,"Another gripe:\n\nWhy is it that most of the bus pass vendors are sketchy check loan centers such as Check City or Money Tree? And at the same time you guys take forever to supply the bookstore at CSN with more bus passes(as of today, they have been out of them for a week).\n(P.S. I'm already aware that they finally decided to start vending them at Alberston's, which, you know, makes sense seeing that it is a grocery store, which is a place that people are more likely to go out of their way for than a fucking Check Cashing place. That's besides my point). \nExcuse me for not wanting to be forced to pay 3-5  bucks more for a piece of paper which you guys already charge too much for to begin with so I don't have to be forced to spend close to ONE HUNDRED dollars in one month on the bus rides I need to get back and forth to school every day. \n\nJust needed to let that out. It always feels slightly better to ride Las Vegas public transportation when you have an outlet to air out your frustrations about it. :)"
0,"I went to visit this place to see if it should be considered as a prospective place to rent. Bad decision. As soon as I was taking the tour of the property a huge huge waterbug was spotted in the model. I could only imagine what the other apartments looked like that were being lived in if a huge waterbug was seen in the model. Omg! I'm terrified of those things. So the lady showing me the model picks it up with a prop inside of the model, and throws it off the balcony (we were on the 2nd floor). Well I hope nobody was walking by, they would've gotten a live roach thrown on them. She said oh, i don't want to kill it. it was still alive, and kicking.. laying on it's back. terrible experience!"
1,"It's a decent place for breakfast or brunch. I've had lots of different things here and none of them are incredible. The potatoes are pretty boring, honestly. The toast is always good. This last time I got the chili with rice instead of pasta. It was ok. I was expecting a small bowl but it was massive and it was covered in cheese. In my opinion, the food here is a 3 but the service is always really good. This last time, Amanda took care of us and didn't miss a beat. Nice job!!"
0,I was there about a year ago watching football with my girlfriend. It was so loud in there we could not even hear our conversation. The place was short staffed and took a long time to get our order. When it came out it was cold so we had to send it back to be reheated. Our waitress did try her best but was overwhelmed. Its fine when it is not busy there but when it is crowded I do not recommend it.
1,"I really wish I could give this place 5 stars.  The food was absolutely outstanding.  However, our service definitely needed a whole lot of work.\n\nMy partner and I wandered in here around 8:00 on a Sunday, which I suppose is not a prime time for burger eating, but I had tried to visit twice before when I was too impatient to fight for parking and wait.  Luckily, we had no wait and got right into the place.  \n\nWe decided to skip appetizers because we figure we would have more food than we could possible ever want to eat.  I ordered the PB&J shake - OMG, this was probably one of the best shakes I have ever eaten.  I could almost swear they put crack in it, or some other equally-addicting drug.  My partner ordered the Bad Ass Burger, which has so much junk on it I won't list it here.  However, the big thing to note is that it had buttermilk-fried bacon on it, and lots of bacon stuffed in the burger itself.  I guess that saying that everything is better fried must be true, because that bacon was SOOOOOO awesome.  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, which I could swear had nearly a pound of bacon on it (half of which had tasty jalapeno bacon).  Both burgers were absolutely delicious, and their sides were pretty good as well (even though neither of us ate too much of them).  We finished our burgers, but my stomach hated me for it.\n\nDespite the good food, our service was awful.  I am not a picky service person, and I don't expect the server to come by and attend to my every need.  However, we waited almost 45 minutes for our food, during which time our waitress pretty much ignored us entirely.  We saw her once after our food got delivered, but she did not stop by again.  We waited almost 20 minutes after we finished eating before we finally went up to the counter to ask for our check.  I looked around to see if she had left, but she was in the back working on prep work.  Really, she couldn't come out and at least bring us our check?  Very, very aggravating.\n\nI have no doubt that I will try it again at a different time on a different night.  Truly, their food is really tasty, reasonably priced, and quite plentiful.  Hopefully the bad service was just a one-off."
1,Enjoyed an excellent dinner..  Sushi..&..Bento Box... Nice feeling inside...friendly staff..a wonderful addition to our area!       Lois
1,"A hidden gem in Las Vegas. I would give a 10.Food, service excellent."
1,You want coffee? This is the place to go. The drive through only has 1 lane and can get a bit congested but they move fairly quick. Everyone here is super friendly. I sometimes wonder how much caffeine they consume cuz they are freaky excited some times. :)
0,"Slightly below average Chinese food for way above average price.  \n\nThe flavors of the various noodles we tried are okay, but they could really do a better job on both presentation and how they cook their core product - the noodles.  The noodles were definitely overcooked, which is a bit of a waste considering that these are hand pulled. \n\nWorst complaint is that you are paying an arm and a leg for Chinese food ($20+ on average), and the portions are absolutely tiny.  Any average guy will need 2 orders.  No really.  \n\nThey are still figuring their shit out here as of their grand opening, which is when I came.  Give them a few weeks; maybe it will get better.  \n\nOr maybe they won't."
0,This is one of the worst nail salons I have ever spent money in. They need to all go back to school and learn how to do nails and also make customers happy. I can't believe the way my nails look. They really should be put out of business. No one is forcing them to do nails so they should take more pride in doing there job! Press on nails would have looked more natural and professional than this mess on my nails!
0,"Can't completely scud this place, it's actually pretty nice inside.  The decor and layout are completely chic and cool.  Was there on a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday night.  Tuesday and Wednesdays were not bad but Friday was ridiculous (see below).\nIf I was a 21 year old nightclub partier, I might even make this place one of my favorites, but there are three things that turned me off about this place and I will more than likely never go back on a weekend.  For one - the line was insane, and it started early.  I was there on a Friday and I was with two other males.  Forget about getting in w/o slipping the bouncer a few bills.  We waited for like 45 minutes while many other people who came after us were let in because they had one female with them, not to be mean, but some of these ladies barely classified as women in my book.  I'm in my thirties and that alone is just too annoying for me especially since I usually spend quite a bit when I go out.  I'm just not into that scene anymore.\n\nMoving on, my friends really want to go in, so we put some money together and suddenly the velvet rope opens for the three sausages to be alowed in.  :-)  Walk in, and it was REALLY loud, like too loud, but there was definitely a lot of energy in the place which is good.  Made our way to the bar, and we have annoying point #2, they have like four bartenders serving twenty thousand people, so we had to order a bunch of drinks and hold them or risk waiting another hour for a refill.  I\n\nAfter a few drinks, we made our way to the dance floor where annoying point #3 reared its ugly head.   Way too crowded and you couldn't move.  I am 6'2\"", 230 lbs and I felt like I was in a coffin.  Some people actually danced in this dungeon of a space, so I was being bumped into, pushed around, an all around crappy time at the dance floor.  One cool thing, Mike Tyson was nearby in a roped off area, and I had heard some other celebs were there as well.  \nIt's definitely a great place to go if you like being squashed in a like a sardine and you have at least one woman with you, but I'm too grown up for that now.  When I go out, I just don't want to deal with that kind of BS anymore."
0,"Not really sure where to begin with this company. First let me start off be telling you any purchase you make there is not guaranteed! At least mine wasn't. They still have my umbrella, in like new condition...that I paid for. The umbrella was supposed to be fixed, and the part ordered for its replacement. It was... a call was made to me to let me know it was there anytime I wanted to swing by and pick it up.\n\nLong story short, they \""lost\"" the replacement part, tried selling me on a new umbrella over the phone and still have my existing umbrella!\n\nThanks for your wonderful service \""after the sale\""!"
1,"I greatly enjoyed this place with my girlfriend. Our idea for coming to Julian Serrano was to eat a lot for a good price, be full, but not too full before our showing of LOVE at the Mirage. We love variety, and Spanish Tapas definitely fell into this category of food exploration.\n\nThe ambiance is very open and colorful matching Aria's theme. You aren't locked up in a restaurant, and you hear everything that is going on within Aria. While away from the casino floor itself, you feel like you are in a mild busy cityscape.\n\nWe had a early dinner reservation at 4:15PM on a Saturday and the place was not packed at all. We sat down, and pretty much knew what we wanted to order and how we wanted to order it since we did our research on Yelp before coming, so here's the breakdown of how everything was. The order going down is how we ordered with the category that it is in. We went in 3's as the tapas come out very quickly!\n\n1. Tuna Raspberry Skewers - Unique twist on sushi. Square in shape, and eaten like a lollipop, I never thought tuna and raspberries would work, but they do! The tuna was soft, the raspberries sweet, but still tart. The crazy thing is that the raspberry is on the side, and they are filled with wasabi. So you eat the tuna skewer + the raspberry with wasibi, and wala ~ tasty tuna sushi. Rating: 4/5\n\n2. Creamy Risotto - The risotto was cooked perfectly, and the wild mushrooms stood out. The manchego cheese was pungent, but tasty tasty because of it's different texture. Rating: 4/5\n\n3. Stuffed Dates - So good! SOOOOO SOOOOO GOOD! This one stood out for us. The date covered in crispy pancetta with the tomato marmalade stuffed with goat cheese. Melt in your mouth FOODGASM. Rating: 5/5\n\n4. White Ceviche - This was a really zesty and fresh ceviche. The white fish was soft, and the mixture of peppers, red onions, and cilantro gave a good bite. Served with crackers, I felt that there may have been too much lime juice. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n5. Spanish Tortilla - This I felt was a take on breakfast & hashbrowns. While many will say it is nothing special, I am a hashbrown feen, so I found it delicious lol. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n6. Octopus - I've NEVER -- EVER -- EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR had octopus this soft before. It was ridiculous how soft it was. I don't know how they got it like this, but some parts just tasted like bone marrow consistency. With potato & Spanish paprika, it was a simple delight. Rating: 4/5\n\n7. Yellowtail with Yam - The crispy yam made this tapa stand out. For if there was none, it would of just been sashimi, and I wouldn't have paid for it. Fresh fish, crispy sweet yam. A sweet and savory combo that worked. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n8. Lobster Saffron - Half lobster tail, saffron oil, iberian pork, creamy potatoes, asparagus. The lobster was wrapped with the iberian pork. The tail was juicy, the potatoes as well. This felt more like a little entree. While delicious, I'm not sure if it was worth getting. Rating: 3/5\n\n9. Albondigas - Oh fluffy fluffy meatballs. So simple, yet so good. Great light sweet tomato sauce. Succulent juicy meatballs that just melt in your mouth. Potatoes in squares lightly crispy. Can I get a side order of rice to fill my Asian needs, and pasta to fill my love for Italian please? Rating: 4/5\n\nSo that was the meal, and as you can see, we ordered a good amount for two people. It filled us, but it didn't overfill us, and that's what we enjoyed. There was nothing bad about the meal, and everything was prepared well. For the price, some may question it, but it's Vegas. I would complain if the food was horrible, but it simply wasn't. You can go ahead and spend $60-80 on a piece of steak medium rare, or come here and experience more for your money! Julian Serrano gets 4.5/5 from me! I may get adventurous next time around and eat things that Yelp has yet to see from here."
1,"Elenir is the best, she is very patient with me she makes laser treatment so pleasant and for sure I am going back to see her. I do recommend the laser treatments for people with acne it really helps."
0,Terrible.  They don't know how to prepare a steak.  It was cold and lifeless.  We asked for it charred medium rare.  Do not eat here.  Remember I warned you!
1,"If you're ever in the mood for sushi and you're in Vegas, but you want to stray away from the over-crowded and over-priced sushi from the strip. Head over to this sushi-gem (off the strip). \n\nThe staff are all legitimate Japanese and so is the food. Quality sushi you can taste. My bf and I ordered the \""Amy\"" roll and the \""Yoshi\"" roll and two soft shell crab hand rolls. Definitely did not disappoint."
1,"This place is great fun.  Who would have thought you could feel like you were at a German beer garden while in downtown Glendale.   Sitting outdoors under the string lights and German beer flags just made you thirsty for beer! Nice selection of draft beers, all were tasty and available in 16 or 32 oz size.  Had sausage sampler with very good sauerkraut . Fresh pumpernickel and rye bread to munch on. Simple dinner salads.  Tried two types of schnitzel, both were great, wanted to order the gnocchi but they just ran out and then had the chicken Marsala which was just OK.\nThey had two accordion players playing classic tunes like the \""chicken dance song\"" and \""it's a small world after all\"".  Mmm good polka music and beer.  \n\nThis place does close at 9, otherwise it would be a great place to hang out all night.  Will go back again for sure."
0,"Dinner was fine. Service was the worst possible. They seated us in a tight area and the servers kept bumping our chairs. I requested the first server to walk around if possible and he kindly obliged. half hour later and a second waiter bumped me. I requested him to now walk around as well if possible. And he doesn't say anything. He comes back 2 minutes later and say excuse me and then nearly smack me in the head trying to get by again. I ask him to come over and he ignores me.  Then he starts getting loud and says I'm going to call the manager. Was really not sure what he was threatening me with. Manager comes over, realizes that we have already paid our bill, quickly apologizes and then walks away. The worst service ever in an unnecessarily pricey restaurant. Couldn't figure out how to do zero stars."
0,"I have been coming to xtreme bean for several years and it is still a generally good place.  the coffee is average or below, the tea selection is good, the atmosphere is ok but same old. The current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling, and even barking, at high decibels.  I've never seen anything like  it anywhere.  I'll have to think twice about coming back if this continues."
0,"I refuse to go to LVAC, hahaha.  Why you ask, because they advertise that women join free, how lame.  It's just a gym, not a nightclub.  I'm there to workout, not pick up on women.  That's the only reason i would think why you'd \""encourage\"" women to join.\n\nBesides that, LVAC is only in Las Vegas.  If you travel a lot, or plan to, then what would be the point of spending all that money on a membership you can only use in Vegas.\n\nI did give it one star as I do like the fact there there is an indoor track at the 215 and Eastern one.  That's all you get though LVAC.  hahaha"

0,"Suit and shirt were not ready when I arrived, but were rushed through. They both smelled foul, not sure if it was the cleaning agents they use or what. I had to rewash my shirt and have it recleaned after my meeting. For the meeting I had to use body spray to mask the smell."
0,"The food is pretty good and there are many options. But I've come here many times because I work across the street, and the service is nothing close to outstanding. I've never seen one of the servers smile. I've had better sushi elsewhere, with better service."
0,"I was excited to try this place after the reviews of the delicious burgers. I purchased 3 groupons for $10 worth of food for $5. First time I went I ordered burger and buffalo chicken wraps. Overall, it was tasty and reasonably priced. I went there a couple of days ago and ordered fried catfish (which was the special of the day) and sauteed shrimp po boys and a side of fries. The shrimp po boy was ok. The shrimp didn't have a ton of flavor. I noticed that my fries were much darker this time, almost black. They tasted bitter. The catfish tasted bitter as well. Everything had this acrid, bitter taste, almost like it was fried in dirty oil. I pretty much had to throw everything out, which I never do. I was glad I didn't get my shrimp po boy fried. I'm pretty sure they would have had the same bitter taste. Very disapppointing. It out of my way, won't be back."
0,"Seriously outdated and food was subpar.  If you like to be sold crap while you eat, this is the place to go."
0,"Stopped for lunch.  Service and food are not  good.  I had the ham and cheese melt.  Bread wasn't toasted and soggy, fries were burnt.  Husband had the crispy chicken sandwich- not worth $10.  Bread was hard and not fresh, fries were burnt also.  We split a slice banana cream pie.  It was okay but nothing about it taste homemade.  As we left I heard they were under new management and I'm wondering if this is why it's going downhill?  Kinda sad as we like to support the locals."
1,Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future. \n\nWe were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings. \n\nThe tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. \n\nVery satisfied with our first experience.
0,Their menus are fun.\nBut I guess they aren't that fun.\nUhhh...where's my pizza?
1,"Our first visit to Via was about five years ago shortly after we moved into the \""Slope\"" aka Sunnyslope.  Back then the waiters were surly, the food was good, and the 99 cent margaritas would knock you on your tukus.  About the only thing that's changed in that time is the margaritas are now $2.99, but you'll still get the same great food and the same surly service.  Well, that's not entirely true of the service.  It's been my experience that if it's a slow night and you have a female server, then your service will be top notch.  If it's busy or you happen to get a male server, then it can get a little frustrating.\n\nI personally think they have the best mild salsa in town.  I always fill up on chips and salsa then feel like someone needs to roll me out the door because I'm so full after dinner.  The portion sizes are huge, so you can't go wrong there.  My favorite dish is the #3 combination, Green Chili Con Carne with rice and beans.  My only complaint is the same with every other Mexican Food restaurant in town, is the lettuce they use as a garnish on the plate.  I've said it before and I'll say it again...Heck I might even climb up \""S\"" mountain and scream it from there...\""COLD LETTUCE HAS NO PLACE ON A HOT PLATE OF MEXICAN FOOD!\""  There, I feel much better now.  But seriously, you don't eat the lettuce, at least I don't, and even when I accidently do, it's hot and soggy.  Who likes that?  But I digress.\n\nThe bar is small, and always crowded.  The patio is nice if the weather is good.  Their list of tequilas is almost two pages long on their menu.  So if you're a tequila aficionado, then you should check it out.  If I had to rate Via on food alone, I'd give it four and a half stars.  If I had to rate via on service alone I'd have to give it two and a half stars only because it's spotty approximately half of the time.  So if I average them together Via would get three and half stars, but I'm going to round it up to four because the last few times, the service has been better and I really like the place."
1,"This Marriott is in a prime location. Just a few blocks from the nightlife section near ASU. Although it is very close to the entertainment, surprisingly it is a quite place. The desk was very helpful. The beds are super comfortable. The price was much better than the others that double the price for the same location."
0,"My family and I travel out to LV at least once a year and one of our \""traditions\"" has been to pick up food from this location at least once during our trip...this was our favorite location out of all the locations we have tried in Nevada and CA up until yesterday.  We were unsure if it was just an off day or if they have just gone completely downhill.  Our small order for 3 people took forever, even though we did not order any special requests.  On top of that, the lady who took our drive thru order had no idea about the menu...she did not even know that there was a foot long hot dog and tater tots special for $3.99 and ended up overcharging us.  Good thing I looked at the receipt.  The bf cautioned me to use cash since my debit card has been over charged in the past.  So either this location recently had a turnover in staff or it has just sunk downhill.  \n\nThe food was just meh aside from taking longer than usual to prepare (3 cheeseburgers, coney, tater tots...no shakes or smoothies, but many factors could have gone into that.  This was very unfortunate, but we are no locals, so our absence will not hurt the establishment much."
0,Closed. Sad.\n\nReplaced with ANOTHER Starbucks.... sigh.
1,There is not to much to do in Arizona. So we went for a scenic drive and it was pretty. The roads can be kind of scary.
0,The totally rude bartender ruined it!  Would not go back.
1,"It was a busy Saturday night.  We waited about half an hour to get seated, which was fine.  The food was good, but the SERVICE, was what makes it a true 5-star experience.  The mussels & and the flan were probably my favorite.. the octopus was a bit over cooked but still tasted alright.  I highly recommend this place!!"
0,"The food here was definitely plentiful, but I thought it was only 'decent.'  Almost everything I tried lacked seasoning.  It's a very pretty restaurant, with traditional Italian (or New York Italian?) style.  Both levels are open to the bustling mall, which as great.  The staff was very friendly, but service was slow and disjointed."
0,"This USED to be our favorite restaurant\n\nthe food is SALTY, the chicken was dry..the steak was tough..the lettuce in the salad was watery(and of all days- it was our anniversary)...plus my amex number was stolen within 20 minutes after paying the bill at Carrabba's(I called and someone did apologize...said they would send a gift card...and that never came)\n\nIf you go there...pay in CASH!"
1,"Great non typical fast food.  Had the Nice to Greek You order and it was very good although not exactly filling.  The side salad I thought was too small.  The choice of ice teas was also good.  Communal big table was OK, not thrilled with it.   Staff was friendly.  Overall  a great experience will be back for at least a second time."
0,I don't really like cold eggs. We waited a really long time for brunch and everyone's food was cold. \n\nTheir bread and raspberry beignets were delicious though.
1,"Metro has great pizza (served piping hot on silver stands) and solidly decent calzones and pasta.\n\nThe best part about Metro is the atmosphere: The tables are covered in white butcher paper and each table is given a pile of crayons.  While this may be a ploy to distract customers from the hungry anxiety of waiting for their order (you can't watch steaming pizzas carried through the restaurant - past your table - while you're occupied with tic-tac-toe), the wait hasn't been unbearably long in my experience.\n\nThey also have theme nights, like 70's/Woodstock and Hawaiian.  I seem to remember something about dressing up and getting some sort of discount.  This is great place for a lively group outing.  (The Flamingo/Decatur location is slightly more intimate).\n\nIn sum: A casual, fun place with good pizza."
0,"with all the hype and reviews about this exhibit I was really excited to come see it but I was really disappointed to be honest.\n\nI felt like I was reading a textbook.\n\nI love history, I love museums, I love medical shows and oddities so I thought this would be exciting to see...its not. \n\nPaid $28 with military discount but it was boring and not worth it."
0,"I have enjoyed the exceptional outside patio here several times. The food is average but I love the patio. I decided to call and make a reservation for our company Christmas party in mid December, I was told by Anthony the gentleman that answered the phone , that \""they don't take reservations\"". I was a bit stunned, I was bringing 14 people for drinks and food but they told me it would be first come first served. Not really the way to plan a holiday party with invited guests, not for me anyway. I questioned the policy but to no avail. I eat out frequently all across the country one of my personal criteria for an exceptional restaurant is one that takes the needed steps to accomodate the customer. Such is not the case here. Just a side note last years Christmas party with the same head count was a $2,200.00 tab."
0,"Two stars for the very high quality ingredients used on sandwiches. Went in with my daughter, she wanted a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles on it. Apparently at jimmy johns pickles are not allowed to touch the bread as I was told they won't put pickles on a sandwich and I just had to buy a side pickle. Seems like a very small step to take for customer service. My daughter spilled her drink on the table and I asked the girl at the counter for a towel. This also seemed to be a monumental task. Overall poor customer service, but still one of the best darn sandwiches I have ever had in my life."
0,"This was the worst dining experience I might have ever had.  We went to Christmas at the Princess last night and chose this restaurant since we have small kids.  We ordered appetizers and mac n cheese for our 2 year old right away to get him occupied.  None of these came.  At least half an hour later, when our food came, they remembered the appetizers.  We had to special request our sons order and of course he was antsy by this point.  The food was less than memorable.  Some of our party had to send their burgers back due to them being undercooked.  Another member of our party ordered a burger and got a chicken sandwich.  The prices were in the $16 dollar range for a burger which is very expensive for what was terrible service and food.  The server rarely checked on us and we kept having to get up and as for things we needed.  To top it all off, when they finally brought the bill it was totally wrong and jumbled so we had to sit and write out specifically what went on each of our 2 bills in order to get it right.  When we mentioned to the manager how terrible the experience was he was confrontational stating that he had removed the late appetizers and undercooked burgers from the bill and wasn't that enough.  I'd recommend eating eating before going to the Princess if you have kids.  Or choose one of the other restaurants if you aren't bringing kids and have a larger budget.  Definitely avoid this restaurant as literally everything was a mess from the moment we walked in on.  And you'd hope for friendly at least, but the servers barely cracked a smile and had quite an edge to them."
1,"Really good oriental chicken salad with a huge slice of sourdough bread. Asian dressing is very good with a nice kick. Nice portions, good price and fast service at the bar during lunch.\n\nAlso has an amazingly good Sunday brunch buffet! Tons of options of which all is good quality. Yo wont leave hungry, thats for sure. Upscale setting that feels like a wedding reception. Busy but not too bad. More expensive but well worth it for higher quality foods."
0,"Normally I don't like to write bad reviews, but in this case I feel like I have to in the hopes that management will take notice and make some serious changes.  This place does not even deserve the one star rating I gave it, but it's the lowest available.  The service was horrible, the drinks were horrible, and the food was horrible. \n\nFirst off, from the time I sat down, it took 10 minutes for a server to come to my table.  And that is not an exaggeration, I timed it.  I ordered a Virgin Bloody Mary and Eggs Benedict (my favorite breakfast).  When the drink came, it was so salty that it was undrinkable.  It tasted like sea water with a hint of tomato, absolutely disgusting.  The food wasn't quite that bad, but definitely not good.  The \""poached\"" eggs were completely solid, not a drop of the gooey, runny yolk that makes me love them so much.  The hollandaise sauce was more of a paste than a sauce, and the accompanying hash browns were burnt on the outside, cold on the inside, and had no flavor whatsoever.\n\nI came in for just a quick breakfast because I had a little bit of time to kill and was horribly disappointed.  My \""quick\"" breakfast took over an hour, was entirely unsatisfying, and highly overpriced for the lack of service and quality.  I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this restaurant."
0,"I went in at about 4:30 this morning to pick up a couple of Double Western Bacon Cheeseburgers to go.  That's what I asked for, that's what the guy repeated to me and charged me for, and that's how they were labeled on the wrapper.  When I got them home, they were single Western Bacon Cheeseburgers.  Looks like these folks need watching."
1,"Always great food and service, you just can't rule this place out ever. Great drink and warm/cozy ambience, I'm a fan!"
0,"Road our motorcycles to the mill this morning for breakfast.  Their website states the restaurant opens at 8 AM on Sunday & we arrived about 8:05 AM.  The staff was in the restaurant talking & everyone started moving around when we walked through the door.  The woman who went behind the counter rudely explained they don't open un 9 AM, we could order breakfast but potatoes wouldn't accompany our meal as they weren't prepared yet.  We were told we would get fruit instead, which was fine with us.  When we explained about the hours shown on their website our comment was ignored.  Another couple made the same comment & were ignored as well.  We ordered the mill's version of Eggs Benedict, which was okay but not great.  The Hollandaise sauce was lacking in flavor & the portion was small for the price.  We ate our breakfast on the outdoor patio which is a lovely setting but had to listen to a staff member's loud cell phone conversation while he was washing to front door windows.  Overall, not impressed.  Most likely won't return."
1,"They had me at \""We will show English Football\""!"
1,Heard about this place from a friend and I am glad that we finally tried it out. Awesome food and awesome service!! Love the old school feel that the restaurant gives. We will definitely be back.
0,"This review of China A Go Go (CGG) in Anthem Village is based on at least 6 dinner visits over the past two months. I'll admit, right off the bat, the food is pretty good and probably better than average for fast food take-out. My gripe is with the rest of the experience. This appears to be a family-owned, family-operated establishment. Whether or not the staff are actually related to one another is irrelevant to this review but it makes for good analogy.\n\nAt my latest visit -- indicative of all my earlier visits -- I was \""greeted\"" by a staff where absolutely everyone was on their smartphone playing games, texting, surfing or whatever. At least the young man, \""the son\"", at the register put down his phone, greeted me with a welcoming smile and asked for my order. The patriarch of the \""family\"" never looked up from his phone and I can honestly say that I've never been greeted by this manager/owner at any time I've ever visited. (The more friendly matriarch, who usually takes my order, was not in the restaurant the evening of my latest visit.) After paying for my order, I noticed that, one by one, the cooks put down their phones and got to the task of making my dinner. I did not see any one of them wash their hands before preparing my food (fortunately, stir-fry woks are very hot). I sat at one of the half-dozen or so empty tables (all the tables were empty except the one the patriarch was seated at) and waited. The tabletop was dirty and there was food on the floor. The small seating area appeared old and the walls really need a refurbishment of sorts to patch holes and refresh the sickly yellow paint. There are cardboard boxes along one wall (containing food and supplies?) along a corridor that leads, I think, to the restroom; a large mirror; a flatscreen TV; and Asian-themed decorations that really need to be cleaned and dusted. It looked like there was a half an inch of greasy dirt and dust on the top of room's motion-detector and the fluorescent light fixtures in the dining area really need to be cleaned out. My food was served hot and well-prepared with fresh ingredients in \""traditional\"" boxes and styrofoam containers along with a container of red \""sweet and sour\"" sauce; two packages each of Chinese mustard, soy sauce and fortune cookies; and a small bag of pretty good crispy wonton strips (a nice touch). The portions are large (half-orders are available) and well-worth the approximately $18 I paid for an appetizer, a main dish and fried rice.\n\nI agree with other reviewers who write that CGG's food is better than Panda Express' mostly because the food is freshly prepared and not left standing in a hot buffet steam tray for some unknown period of time. But I believe that all staff who are in the \""front of house\"" should be welcoming to their customers; staff should not be preoccupied with outside activities especially when customers are around; staff should practice good hygiene and technique before touching and preparing food or handling \""to go\"" packages; staff should not be standing/sitting on the ground out in front of the restaurant smoking cigarettes; and that the restaurant and seating areas should be clean and properly maintained. I'll continue to visit CGG from time to time for the food and convenience but I don't think I'll ever really feel welcome or comfortable eating there.\n\nIt makes me sad to write this review because I truly believe the \""family\"" that owns/operates this restaurant is trying to make a good product for their customers. I'm not trying to hurt their business; rather, I hope this review helps them to make their business better. I'll update this review if I notice any positive changes.\n\n-- 3.0 stars for the food minus 1.0 stars for the experience"
1,being that i am thai and have had thai food from many places in america and in thailand let me be the first one to say that this place could have possibly the best THAI FOOD in america that i have had...when i say best i mean authentic not that natalee thai crap or any of that stuff that is watered down and served to people who dont know anything about thai food...this place has a thai and chinese menu.....stick with the thai food here....\n\nevery time i set foot in las vegas eating here is a must...the food is made here the way it is supposed to be made...SIMPLY AMAZING!
1,"I love this location. The people are courteous and friendly, and I have never had to wait in line. \n\nTo make a very, very, very long story short: I am a recent convert to Wells Fargo. Tom Quinsler, the Branch Manager, for this location went out of his way to assist me in the cash purchase of a home. Due to the large nature of the transactions, my money could have been held for weeks until the bank was certain I was not a terrorist or a thief. Tom inserted himself in the situation and allowed me access to my money so that I could meet the date requirements for my home purchase. \n\nTom risked a slap on the hand to meet a customers' need, and that is customer service that we just no longer see. My thanks to Tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience!"
1,"The vine has seriously legit wings, and on Tuesdays and during happy hour, they are only $4.99 for a dozen (woah, right?!). There are a lot of TVs, so it's also a place I'd recommend watching a sports game."
0,"I've been to coin-op laundry places before.  I know what to expect.  I didn't expect what I saw at this place.\n\nI arrived at about 6:15PM.  The sign said last wash should occur at 6:30PM.  Even still, after I had started my loads the lady came by and was asking when I would be done and whatnot.  LEAVE ME ALONE LADY.  I know you want to go home, I understand, but I did nothing wrong.\n\nThe place is filthier than most laundromats.  A difficult task to accomplish.\n\nThe worst part about this place is the amount of broken machines.  More than half the driers are out of service.  More than a third of the washers are out of service.  Stuff brakes, I understand.  However....besides rent, the main operating cost is servicing the machines.  Why is this not a priority with these people?"
1,"THIS IS FOR REAL!\nI am born and raised from San Diego, and one perk is we are so close to TJ, Mexico for delicous tacos. We have Tacos el gordo all over San Diego and it is AUTHENTIC taco stand tacos. Everything is finger licking GOOD! You pay a little bit more but trust me it's so worth it!\n\nENJOY!"
0,Never enough employees working especially in the morning. Food is good and customer service is standard. Just wish they had more people working there to speed up the process.
0,"Look up a review by Jennie M. She sings high praises for this place. I cannot say the same. I am a firm believer that one review or one bad day should be the only thing to base the value of a venue on. So to those ends and the countless positive reviews I will share my opinion without too much judgement.  Just a declaration of my experience the one day, the one time I tried it. By the time we went to find this place it was well know so there wasn't much secret but who can really keep secrets on the Internet?  The pizza was lacking flavor,  over cooked and bland.  There was little more personality than a prison lunch line and I left feeling it should have remained a secret. The experience did not live up to the hype.  Given the other reviews it might be worth giving them a second chance."
0,"It was decent. I loved my dish but some of my friends didn't like theirs. \n\nI had the sesame crusted ahi tuna and it was really good. The tuna was just right and the sauce was fantastic. However, I tried some kind of spanish Chicken dish and the chicken was super dry. They had to return it and order something else. They got the seabass instead cooked with a light ginger soy sauce. It was cooked just right and the taste was really good. I just think everything is a bit overpriced for the quality of food. \n\nI do have to say I like the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's very intimate and classy, a good place for a date night. \n\nSo if you decide to go here, my advice is to stay away from the chicken and order seafood!"
1,"Servers are friendly and organized. I would recommend the beef tripe/tendon, short ribs and for dessert the sweet tofu. Definitely a place to visit when in Vegas with the family."
0,"went there twice in the last 2 weeks waitress just ignores me and takes customers orders that came in after me. I  then just get up and leave, they seem to care less."
1,Great selection of beer and very friendly to cyclists!  The food here is good as well !  Parking is a little tight but overall a great experience!
0,"Absolutely disgusting. After getting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eating the cold crab legs (yes, shouldn't have risked it at a buffet) I had to go lay down and was sick all night. THEN the next day I went to talk to the manager who was SO rude. He asked why I didn't say something that night.... Ummmm because I was so sick I had to bolt! And I NEVER get sick from food. He informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report. Complete BS. Don't go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly."
0,"So many of my go to places for lunch are losing thier ratings. \n\nWent here for lunch today for the Banh Coun, one of the few places in vegas that offers it good and I was disappointed. \n\nThe dish comes with Chai Lu, which is the pork meatloaf and the meat smelled and tatsed bad. It was probably too old or bordering it and they still put it in the dish. That is un-excusable. \n\nThe plaza they are in is dying out fast, almost all the leases on teh 2nd floor are closed now. From the way it is going they may be next, it was really slow in there which explains the old products they use. \n\nThey did open Mr. Sandwhich closer to the strip on the same street and most patrons might be going there now, I have gone to Mr. Sandwhich more than this place now too. \n\nWould not go there again."
1,"By far my favorite place to stay at in Vegas. It has a low key atmosphere without all of the distractions most places in Vegas offer. Want to learn how to play craps or pai gow poker, stop in and find a table. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. It is off the strip but close enough that you could get to the heart of Vegas. Vegas is not Vegas to me unless I stay here. Rooms have recently been renovated also."
1,"Stopped in for some coffee last week and have been every weekday since. Everything I've had here is good. Would pick this place over Starbucks any day of the week.\n\nSo far I've tried the Raspberry Mocha and peanut butter Mocha, both awesome!"
1,"I quite liked this place.  We went for a dinner with another couple.  Ordered a couple appetizers, a couple beers, a bottle of wine, large pizza and 2 entrees.  The bill was over 100 but not too crazy.  The service was great.  Do not underestimate the size of these pizza's!  They are huge!  And delicious!"
0,"I don't get it. I ordered a couple of slices of veggie pizza. It was loaded with fresh veggies and I love that, but the overall taste of the pizza was just OK. This pizza must be eaten immediately, the leftover slice 2 hours later made me wanna cry. I only ate half of it and sadly threw it out! I spent way to much money for bad pizza."
1,"This is an absolutely amazing place to have a romantic dinner or simply have a casual dinner. I have been here once, for my birthday a year ago and the experience was amazing. My date & I sate outside, the view of the strip and the Bellagio water show was the topping on the cake:-) The food was a lot but it was delicious especially their French Onion Soup; they really set the standards for me with the Soup no other place can compare after I tasted this one by far the best. \nOur waitress was amazingly sweet, helpful, funny, & tentative. I would definitely go back when I visit again."
1,"I learned so much about hair today!  When I went in, my hair looked like absolute crap.  I'd had a bad experience letting a new person cut my hair, so I was extremely anxious about this appointment.  But I can say with certainty that I have never sat in the chair of a hair stylist who knows more about hair.  Kelly Z  really knows her shit.  She took the nastiest, botched up cut and made it awesome.  The things she taught me may be common knowledge to everyone else, but I am utterly incompetent when it comes to hair.  I had no idea that by washing my hair every day, I was stripping all the moisture from my hair and combined with this dry Wisconsin winter (something I know nothing about, having spent 22 years in the south), I had created so much static electricity that I couldn't flip a light switch without getting shocked!  Anyway, I'm incredibly happy with my haircut; Kelly Z did an amazing job with everything.  Also, Rosa gave me the best eyebrow wax I've ever had.  No slapping on some hot wax and ripping out your hair.  This girl takes her time and does a thorough job.  I could barely even feel when she pulled off the strips.  Thank you so much, ladies!!"
1,"Tottie's is one of those rare restaurants that does two cuisines well - Thai and Chinese.  They may have gone overboard on the \""fusion\"" part -- the Thai Fried Chicken with Basil and the Chinese General Tsao's Chicken are almost indistinguishable -- but the Thai curry and noodle dishes are distinct anyway.\n\nThe three major strengths here are:\n1.  The food is uniformly well prepared and tasty.  They have even apparently lost their bread crumbs -- thank goodness -- so the fried dishes are meaty not doughy.\n2.  The prices are very low.\n3.  The restaurant is far more attractive than you would expect for the type of cuisine and price.\n\nThere are some rough spots, however.  Whenever there is any sort of crowd, service slows down - and it can be crowded even on a weeknight.  The menu is not imaginative at all, and many of the dishes are similar to one another.\n\nBut when you plunk down $30 for a dinner for two (the entrees are large enough so that you don't need appetisers), including tax and tip, you leave congratulating yourself for being such a clever fellow.  (I told them they should raise their prices)."
1,"Awesome beer selection and great burgers.  World famous?!?  Well, that's a bit of a stretch.  I think there are other burgers here in Phoenix that are just as good.  I'm not saying I've come across one that's much better, but definitely on the same level as this.  That being said, if you're looking for an amazing burger joint, this is one of them.  Pair it up with the awesome beer selection and that's what makes this place a cut above the rest.  It's a great location in a great neighborhood.  Prices are fairly reasonable but anytime you go above the $10 mark for a burger, it's a problem."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking for a sexy couples night and we kept hearing about treasures. So, we decided to go. It all started off pretty good with the ride to treasures, then they tell you for a couple it will be $56 dollars (okay well not unreasonable). Made sense because you got 4 drink tickets with it and a ride to and from the club. Once we got it, it was kind of a shock. We were thinking higher end girls, and pretty ones. Let me just tell you having 50 girls just standing around that are fucking ugly is not a great thing for a club trying to make money. We decide let's have fun since we are here. Once we sat down a girl sat right next to us smoking and started talking a mile a minute and would not stop. At one point my fianc\u00e9 was going to tell her to go away, but it was about to get good because she was the only somewhat attractive one there. All I wanted was a lap dance. Once we told her that she jump to talking about having 15 mins with her in a private space (which really is not the private) and spending $100 for 3 songs, did I mention she also said 2 drinks were \""free\"" and she would push it out to 20 min for us because \""she liked us\"". While talking to us about this she started slandering other races and talking about her fellow dancers in a very negative way. I will also mention as this was going on her eyes were starting to close and she conned us into buying her a drink, but guess what we did. So we turned down her offer of a \""private space\"" and told her we just wanted her to give me a lap dance. She pulled us to another table and was about to give me a lap dance and we were sooooooooo close (top came off and so did here outer panties) and then some women asked my fianc\u00e9 if he wanted company and he turned her down, then as I was about to get my lap Dance FINALLY, or what I thought.... The girl got into an altercation with the girl who asked my fianc\u00e9 if he wanted company. Very nasty words were exchanged in front of us. And then it got awkward and weird because these girls just wanted to keep fighting. Obviously, the girls at the club did not like the girl we had. So 1 hour later, no lap dance, and an upset stripper, and a free ride back to the hotel. At least we got to see two strippers get into it! What a highlight for a couple trying to have some \""sexy time\"". Guess that did not work out! This place is not professional and the girls are rude and disgusting. I would not recommend this to ANYONE! Maybe next time we will try the Rhino, we heard that one was good also."
1,"Just got back from Vegas yesterday and the experience would not have been half as fun if I hadn't come across this site! I was pretty skeptical...I kept thinking, \""What's the catch?\"" It seemed too easy. Well it was literally just as easy as it seemed.\n\nMy sister and I went to three different clubs, three different nights (including a Friday) and didn't pay cover, hardly waited in line, and got free drinks until midnight each of the nights. All I had to do was email or text Chris which club I was interested in that night and everything else was set up through him!\n\nI will definitely be recommending this to anyone I know going to Vegas and it will be the first site I visit in any return trips of my own. You have nothing to lose by using this site..but everything to lose if you don't."
1,"had dinner there - ordered the international sampler and thought it was good but i wish i just ordered one thing. i didn't love the hummus so much, but the italian (lasagna?) was quite delicious! i noticed on the smoothie/juice menu that you can add honey or bee pollen, which isn't vegan. ok ok, i'm not vegan either, but i used to be and the mixed messages bother me! :) that said, it was good and probably the healthiest option in this crazy town of all you can eat fattening buffets."
0,We went there for lunch it was not crowded waitress seemed overwhelmed and not very friendly. I ordered a large nacho this came out on a oval skillet platter and it was really small the extremely large pile of nacho loveliness was scary I started at the top and worked my way in this caused a avalanche of nachos into my lap. And the middle chips were dry. I also ordered a margarita the mango one it tasted like straight alcohol and yes it was blended so will I go back probably not could it be a better place yes but they need to get bigger plates and not use the fajita skillets for the large nachos
1,"First time here. Ordered the Mexican tacos: chorizo and carnitas. Wife had the verde chicken enchiladas. Very good chips and salsa and they also brought out a small chicken, rice, cilantro soup with the chips for free that was very delicious!  Very good service, and nice staff.  \n\nAll of the food was very good quality and fresh tasting.  This is now one of my 2 top places in Madison for tacos!"
0,I would have rather stayed at the super 8 motel than this place ever again. I stayed here 3 years ago ANC the room itself was dirty and there was a unidentified red streak in the wall that looked like blood. It never rains in Vegas but the one time it did was when we were staying here and it was the most rainfall recorded in years... The room 2 doors down's ceiling collapsed and the whole floor smelled like mildew. Not one person checked up on us or anything and when we said something about the smell the didn't move us or anything. I will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either.
1,"LOVED IT! great staff and the best Hawaiian food outside of HI.. i always craved good Hawaiian food, but could never find it, until i came here! always a great choice!!"
1,"\""Vol de Nuit\"" is translated from Drinking Student's french as \""cheap good beer\"".\n\nIn the summer their outdoor seats are a bit difficult to navigate unless you are paper-thin, but provide a wonderful spot for people-watching. as the crowds flock from Saint-Laurent boulevard onto rue Prince Arthur, maybe on their way to classy and francophone rue St Denis.\n\nIn winter the indoor bar can get full, but it is hardly ever crowded. It is a big plus for this place: a crowded bar with people both seating and standing around ruins the night.\n\nVol is not a bar worth standing in without somewhere to put your pint down, but for those seated it offers relative peace and comfort. Their tables are spread out sufficiently wide along the walls, while nothing obstructs the middle area except a few high tables. The conversation can flow very smoothly due to the music not being too loud and a few conversation starters hanging from the walls.\n\nTheir Sangrias weren't very inspiring last time I tried, but feel free to give them a shot. Do yourself a favour and skip the commercial big-brand beers. Get yourself a pitcher of dark hemp beer (the white one isn't up to scratch, but I'm a dark beer lover myself). Follow up with a pitcher of any Quebec beer except Boreale they have on tap. I think Cheval Blanc is a regular there.\n\n$5 pints and ~$10 pitchers can't be beaten easily. Go to Vol for a decent drink with your friends after dinner or before hitting the clubs."
1,"Stopped by the weekend they opened and the place was packed.  The employees were friendly and fun, and obviously enjoy what they are doing.  I've been back many times since and have ALWAYS loved my drinks and the service.  The italian Soda's are amazing, and the Mocha Freeze was awesome too!\n\nMy only complaint is that they used \""canned\"" whipped cream, i wish they made it themselfs!"
0,"This place is only awesome if you are one of three things: 1. an Ohio State fan, 2. a metrosexual, or 3. someone trying to hook up with an Ohio State fan or metrosexual...Everyone else, do yourself a favor and go to any one of the many hundreds of awesome bars in old town that will happily accommodate the general public."
1,"I am still a sushi novice and remain in the calm waters of the California roll and salmon rolls - occasionally Philadelphia and Las Vegas....meeting up with Ebony K. she attempted to move me a little more off the wall. I went as far as the rainbow roll and looked at her Unagi Roll...not going that far yet. She is a sushi fan and far more adventurous than I am - she might try a Kraken if they could catch it and put it in a nice hand cut roll - and if it's happy hour, then it's on!\n\nWe sat in the back and it was nice and quiet at first, but soon on a Saturday night the place was packed. I will recommend the drinks - she had a pomegranate martini, which was good - but my watermelon martini was phenomenal! \n\nThe service was good, the sushi was fresh, and the atmosphere was excellent. Getting a table wasn't bad - 5pm on Saturday night and we walked right in - later in the evening there was a wait. Parking in that part of Scottsdale is always a challenge. It might be best to just pay the $5 valet and let them worry about finding the spot."
1,"The food at Green was impressively similar to the things they're fakes of. I'm surprised someone said portions were large, they were quite the opposite. I can't imagine eating here often, the food definitely isn't healthy, if you eat whole plant foods, you'll be reminded for a couple days :-/. I was shocked when I asked if there were tree nuts (allergic-not deadly just painful) in anything I wanted to order, it took a while for them to find out & didn't sound sure or convincing (playing with fire). Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and it's nice for transitioning into veganism or satiating cravings if you need to."
1,"Amazing color selection (great quality), super friendly ALL lady nail techs who really do an excellent job. This shop changed management a few months back and the new folks are AMAZING. It's the perfect blend of friendly, neighborhood nail salon, great prices and clean, modern equipment. You will NOT be disappointed!"
0,"This place is just like the other buffets that you can get for $15 less up the street. There is nothing novel here aside from trying to be \""hip\"". \n\nMy confession is i HATE buffets. I hate cold food, and i hate \""fake\"" gourmet food. Check, Check, Check. \n\nThe waiter has to be asked twice for coffee.. all they do is bring drinks.. really.. we can't get juice and coffee down? And no offer to give us our mimosa or bloody mary which i didn't even know was included.\n\nThe waffle i had (pecan waffle) was GOOD but freezing cold. Not worth the 30 minutes walk from venetian.  (as i had a waffle, bacon, sausage, fruit and a spoonful of gelato.. that's all they give you, a spoonful)\n\nIn short, if you're going to eat at a crappy buffet, pick a place that's much cheaper, you're getting the same crappy food!"
0,Unfortunately I got scammed into signing up for their care contract and I am so disappointed with it. EVERY single time I go in they try to upsell me something and tell me it's not covered in the pet care visits. This is the biggest mistake I have ever made. The vet techs leave my dog smelling like cigarettes after they examine them and a couple of them act as though they don't even care. Do not bring your pets here!!
1,Stayed here for a few days in the newly remodeled tower. I really enjoyed my stay and have no complaints on the cleanliness of the room or house keeping. My only gripe is that the AC is so freaking loud! That it makes it hard to fall asleep.
0,"Overpriced!  I was very surprised at the expensive buffet price.  Around $80 for three of us on a Wednesday night.  Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese)\nThere was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess. \n\nPrime Rib was ok. No real complaints there. \nHowever, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.\n\nThey do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good. They also wouldn't give us bottled water \""because we weren't Diamond Plus  members\""  Ridiculous!"
1,"I have been here three times, and loved it each time. \nThe best part is, of course, the setting,  on my favourite street in Edinburgh,. The interior of the restaurant is stunniing, and extremely romantic.  I felt like I was dining in a castle or a manor house. \nWe ordered a red wine from the Languedoc region in France and it was very good value for money. \nMy venison was tender, and mild in flavour with a delicious sauce that I wish I could duplicate at home. I am not usually a big fan of puddings but ours were quite tasty and not overly sweet. \nMy only suggestion is that I wish they offered Sides on the menu so that we could take more advantage of their wonderful produce. Perhaps next time I will ask, why didnt I think of that last eveninig? :-)"
0,"You have to try pretty hard to mess up chicken shawarma, but these guys do it in spades. Every place I've ever had chicken shawarma, its made from chicken breast that's been roasted in and sliced from a shawarma cooker. This place however, uses cut chunks of thigh meat full of grisel and connective tissue. Seriously disgusting. And don't bother with a salad unless you like it swimming in dressing."
1,"If you want Vintage, this is were you go.  I am vintage hound and this place sparked a interest with me.  They have decent men's selection which a lot of trendy store seem to be lacking. \n\nThe coat section is pretty awesome.  Vintage leather, Suede, corduroy, you name they had it on the rack.   The had some good sizing too, I am a skinny lanky dude.\n\nEverything is well laid out and organized well.   The prices are high, but you can get some great 1 off vintage items here.  I am still hope to get a \""leather sweater\"" in my size there."
1,"Picking up a few things around the corner at CVS, Bear and I were trying to figure out what to have for dinner.  He found Fatburger across the way, but neither one of us was in the mood for THAT. What he wanted was good Mexican food, which sounded alright to me.  That's when I remembered that a co-worker of mine, who's also a local, RAVED about Roberto's.  We'd already seen a few of them around, but hadn't yet taken the plunge, so it was settled.\n\nNOW I get the raves.  Quality-wise, this is DA MUY BUENO BOMB-DIGGETY. Bear had the chicken burrito - which was HUGE - while I settled on the chicken chimichanga, which was REDONKULOUS. Paired with a beef quesadilla, it looked (and felt like) enough to feed an army...and at a reasonable price! Yet unlike your typical fast Mexican food, say, that place with the bell and the chihuahua? THIS was good stuff, yet not at all heavy or greasy.  It took some time to finish so we didn't have leftovers, (which we couldn't have taken with us, anyway), but I didn't feel like I needed the entire defensive line of the Atlanta Falcons to help roll my ass outta there when we were done.\n\nThe place was pretty clean and the service surprisingly fast for a place run by just two guys behind the counter.  As a local myself now, I sure am glad there's a bazillion Roberto's around town, so we can find one whenever we need one!"
0,Really slow service! Won't be back. Should have trusted the reviews of my fellow Yelpers
1,"This place is great, everything about it. Last night my waitress was scarce but another was on top of my drinks. Go figure. But the street tacos are a definite order every time...just delicious. Great happy hour menu and the reverse happy hour make for a terrific late night snack."
1,Delicious food at very reasonable prices. Great for this college area of town. MILKSHAKES are so good!
1,"This place is like McDonalds for me. Its consistent good. It's not the best quality kbbq meat, but it's damn good, and good enough. The meat drippings fall onto all that kimchee and bean sprouts which they use for an excellent heart stopping fried rice at the end. \n\nThis time my family of 4 ordered a combo for 3-4 and the blood sausage soup (best here). Didn't even make it to the rice at the end. Totally stuffed and completely satisfied. \n\nAmazingly, the male server was very polite and attentive too. He needs to teach those ladies how to do things."
0,"June 28th,  104 degrees outside.  Feels close to the same inside. I made a comment to my wife as the owner passed by so he would overhear me and thankfully,  he did and after 10 minutes,  it felt much better. \n\nDefinitely pass on the appetizer sampler as everything is completely fried fried and fried. Even the dumplings were fried as well and had some type of sweetener on them. The fried avocado was smothered in sauce and after a few minutes was completely soggy. The Tempera was mostly that ;tempura with a sliver of vegetable. We ended up taking most the sampler home because our nephew, 17 will eat anything and I didn't want to throw away $13.\n\nI order the half half eel dragon and spicy crunchy roll($10) It tasted fresh and was decent, but again had way too much sauce all over it . I've been here about 7 or 8 times and think this experience will be my last."
1,"\""I ate sooo much, now I gotta go to sleep\""!"
1,"I appreciate this hilton location because they made me feel appreciated. The great things about it were:  nice rooms, nice service, nice ambiance and enviornment. Nice food/drink/market, nice spa, nice pool/jacuzzi/bar area, nice perks for listening to their timeshare presentation. A cool alternative to the usual \""vegas hotel\"" experience."
1,"Matt was awesome. They gave me the best quote for our 2014 Honda pilot. They were professional, knowledgeable,  and do awesome work. I made my appointment, dropped the Pilot off, and 2 1/2 hours later they were done! Im pleased with the work they did! Im sending all my peeps his way!"
1,"Excellent food, great staff. Been here 3 times and love it. Fantastic atmosphere. Vegetarian options for the girl! Will be back many times!"
1,"(Salon review): I needed a haircut so I made a last minute appointment with this salon. I was scheduled with Larry, who could not have been nicer. He cut my hair beautifully, I could tell he's a perfectionist, and he carried on a really pleasant conversation with me. I will definitely be returning to this location to see Larry."
1,"This place is awesome!! We order probably weekly from them because it's so yummy and convient. They deliver for free, the food is always hot, fast, and super good! All the employees are also very nice. We love it and if you like chinese food you will too!!"
0,"If you like rude clerks, cockroaches, and being overcharged well do I have the place for you! 35th Ave Sew & Vac!  \n\nI had a horrible experience here. It was my first time and I brought my one year old daughter. Unlike every fabric store in America they didn't have carts. They also didn't have a changing table so I had to change my daughter in my car in 115 degree weather.   \n\nThis was all forgivable, but when I asked a clerk if they had any carts she was very rude, and said something under her breath as I walked away. Later my daughter rushed for something on the floor and instinctively I picked her up and it's a good thing too because it was a large dead cockroach in the isle.   \n\nWhen I went to get my fabric cut my daughter was fussy. Considering that she has two molars coming in, which anyone with any empathy would understand except the people here. The woman cutting the fabric was very rude. She asked how old my daughter was, and later told me I should have put my one year old daughter in their fabric carts...I mean really? Because you don't have shopping carts, you're going to tell me that I should put my one year old daughter into the fabric cart? It didn't even have a bottom. My daughter would have gotten her foot stuck and been hurt. The lady's response when I told her this was that some other person had put their child (not toddler but child) in the quilt cart just the other day. Wow...just wow.   \n\nAt this point I put everything I was getting on the table and said no thanks. I didn't get anything. I had about $70 worth of fabric at that point, and had planned to keep shopping, but I left.   I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! EVER! You couldn't pay me to go here. They are overpriced anyway. Horrible, horrible, horrible experience!  \n\nAnd I wish I could give them no stars."
1,"We went on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated right away. Server was very knowledgeable & she helped us through the wing ordering options. The Fiesty Feta w/Pita chips is DELISH! The wings are crispy, juicy, and seasoned to perfection.  The Mushroom Swiss Burger had great taste of the grill with fresh crisp lettuce & plump tomatoes & mushrooms. They even have a rewards card & will send u coupons and freebies for your bday. Prices are reasonable and average. Will definitely go back!"
1,"I am almost always satisfied with my shopping experiences at Sephora.  I have been shopping there for the last few years, driving up to 45 minutes to get there instead of going to other stores.  \n\nThe staff are warm and welcoming and passionate about the products.  They seem to be solution-oriented and really help find the perfect product for your individual needs.  Only once they ran out of the product I use, but offered a very comparable option.  I have very sensitive skin and yet I loved the alternative.\n\nEvery so often there is an associate that isn't up to these helpful standards and seem a bit stuck up, and that's the only reason I'm giving 4/5."
0,"Not a fan, took my son here for lunch. Menu seems fairly limited and over priced. I've had better pizza at the larger chains."
0,"It's hard for me to rate a movie theater below three stars because you kinda know what you're getting into when you go there. This place is an exception. The seats creak loudly. While this may serve to make a horror movie extra scary, for all other movies it will just make you annoyed as hell."
0,"Never again. We got wood here for a few years but the last time I parked too close to a truck (maybe 10 feet away) and the owner went nuts and started screaming and yelling. I was more than willing to move my car quickly but he went crazy on me and my husband. \nNo thanks to this redneck, abusive cash only business owner, no thanks, dangerous temper tantrums."
1,"Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat!"
0,"Pure Eyecandy. The 2 is for Brunch. I say a 4 if ordering off the menu. \n\nI had Brunch the food was bland, flavorless, boring. Please believe I ate almost everything they had to offer for brunch however based on the flavor of the food I felt ripped off. It was just completely unsatisfying . However service is great, the atmosphere is beautiful and the people sexy. It's $38 for brunch plus $10 for unlimited Bloody Mary's. \n\nEat here for lunch or dinner order off the menu. Every time I have ordered off of the menu I have had a good meal and the flavor is excellent."
1,"great great food , good prices , great ambiance , great  waiter korean and speaks Spanish amazing !!"
0,"Avoid this Kidsquest Boulder Station location and go for other locations at Las Vegas if possible!\n\nI was extremely dissatisfied about the child care service provided to my 19-month old baby from this center. First, during her 5-hour stay, not food nor drink was provided or attempted to be provided to my baby. My baby was crying like crazy when I picked her up. I need to give her formula immediately. She consumed it non-stop and stopped crying after that. I read the check-out form and no meal/snack/fluid was noted. Second, when I checked her in, the staff said a meal will be given to her since she will have a 5-hour stay from evening around dinner time. Obviously, it was just a lie. In addition, I was not reminded at all about the additional charge if I pick the kid up late. I was charged $25 even I was a few minutes late. Finally, the staff over there were totally unfriendly. I was treated like I have been giving them trouble. Their attribute was unacceptable and they were irresponsible for my kid's stay. I called the customer relations department and told them all these. They said they are going to research and talk to the director of this center. I will wait for their callback and may need to escalate this to Nevada Department of Health and Human Services of their inhuman treatment to my baby."
0,"My wife and I came here on a Friday night with our 15 month old toddler. Probably won't be coming back, unless they make some changes. \n\n First impression: host and hostess were friendly, seated us right away, got us a highchair immediately, and asked if we needed anything for our child. Off to a good start...\n\nWe were seen immediately by the waitress (Taylor I think) and another girl she was training. Both were nice, friendly, and full of smiles. Taylor tells us their \""special\"" today is a $4 Kona Longboard draft. Thinking I missheard I asked her to repeat that. Nope, their beer special is a $4 draft. That's not a \""special\"" folks, that's just a normal priced beer. On the plus side, however, they had a pretty good beer selection, though with no prices on the menu I think they failed themselves there. It's not a nice enough place for a no-price drink menu.\n\nThe chips and salsa cost $3.75 (which is $3.75 more than every other taco place I've been to in my life), but we ordered them anyway because they came with \""bottomless chips\"" and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5. The chips were light and actually pretty tasty, with no complaints about either of the salsas. That is until we ordered a refill of our \""bottomless\"" chips, and were told the chips were bottomless but not the salsa. Ummm, ok maybe you should have said that upfront. 75cents for each extra salsa. We felt tricked, which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth, even before the mediocre entrees did the same.\n\nBefore we even ordered our entrees, we felt they were $3-$5 overpriced. For example, $12 for 2 corn tacos, $15 for 3 (though it does come with a side). For carb-watchers, they offer lettuce-wrap as a taco option, which we felt was a smart move, along with traditional corn or flour. I got the corn, my wife got the lettuce wrap. Unfortunately, both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks. Shout out to the service, they fulfilled our high-maintenance order of 2 different 2-taco entree choices, each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them. It's too bad neither taco was very good (we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor). For sides, my wife got the mexican street corn, which was by far the best thing we ordered. GET THIS SIDE. It's delicious. I could have skipped the entrees and the salsa and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy. I got the jicama radish slaw, which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots. I saw neither jicama nor radish. DO NOT GET THIS SIDE.\n\nHere's what we would tell the management if they had a \""contact us\"" option on their website:\n1) Reduce entree prices by at least $3\n2) Always offer a reasonable drink special, even on Friday nights.\n3) If you offer bottomless chips (and charge for them), also offer bottomless salsa. Otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.\n\nBottom line: we probably won't go back anytime soon, but if they're still around in 6 months we'll check the menu to see if they've changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time. We live nearby and would love to see them be successful, they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews, taking advice, and adapting accordingly."
0,"I would give this place a 2.5 . I went here with my boyfriend just to try it out because we've never been, but we've always heard about it. We didn't need a reservation and we didn't have to wait because it is less busy on Mondays.\n\nWe looked at the menu and was surprised on how expensive everything was. Nothing was very appetizing from what I read in the descriptions of the food items. I was craving some tomato soup so I got one. My boyfriend ordered the frozen hot chocolate and burger combo.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was good.  If you love whipped cream and chocolate Frappuccinos then I'm sure you'd enjoy this.\n\nThe creamy tomato soup was okay. It tasted more like pasta/marinara sauce. It was not creamy at all. \n\nThe ABC burger was horrible.  The bun was burnt and so was the burger. I could not eat this. I like a little charbroiled flavor but this was too much. I looked at the burger and the bottom was all black! I don't like complaining about the food so I didnt. But that burger needed to go straight to the trash.  Definitely not worth almost 20 bucks.  Plus none of the toppings were mind blowing. \n\nThe service was good. I found it so interesting that the Togo area next door is so much cheaper than the restaurant. Maybe next time I'll just try that. \n\nI wouldn't go back here."
0,"I'm sitting here and listening to the worker complain loudly while I eat. First it was the way people closed, then it was their green cards and then who knows what else. The ice tea had three cubes of ice, the hash browns were cold and the toast was dry. No melted butter on the toast."
0,"They were sent out by my home warranty.  If I could give them less that one star, I would.  Unfriendly, slow, showed up 45 minutes after the appointment window (after I had told them I would have to take an afternoon off so I could be there in the window they stated), and the technician did not identify himself when he came to my house, I had to ask who he was and why he was here...  I do not understand how a business like the still keeps the doors open.  If I ever have appliance issues again, I will request my home warranty send anyone but this company.   Truly a horrible experience!"
0,"I've been to the Dane before, and it's been decent.  However, I'm waiting for a revolutionary experience.  It just hasn't happened yet.  I went there for the Superbowl with a few friends and sat near the bar.  The staff was not helpful.  I had to go up to the bar for everything and even then it was very slow service.  Unfortunately, my BBQ pork sandwich didn't make up for the poor service."
1,"I have to say when it comes to Stingrays sushi and service, they are the best. Some reviews on here talk about the price of the rolls but why on earth would you want to be eating cheap raw food? Their menu is affordable especially during happy hour and the food is awesome. My server, Bri was suggesting items to my blind date who was a sushi virgin and he loved her recommendations. Overall great atmosphere and sushi at Stingray!"
0,"I just got home from a week in Vegas and went to nice dinners every night.  I was really looking forward to Craftsteak because of all the hype and the chef.  \n\nWas it good, yes.  Was it great, no.  For the money I paid I expect it to be great or beyond.   The ambiance and drinks were phenomenal, but the steak and sides were par.\n\nI ate at 'The Country Club' at Wynn and 'Prime'  at the Bellagio - both exceeded this place and were cheaper as well."
0,"The worst place I have ever been to and I was actually attempted to give them a second chance. The only reason they appear to do good on social media is because of the prices. I took my dogs to them last year, never at any point was I asked for my shot records. I took one in for Grooming and a shave and the other one just for a bath. After we returned home I decided I wanted the other one shaved. I took her back the next day and then, picked her up later in the day. It was close to closing and when I went in to get her the woman seemed annoyed. I figured it was because it was the end of the day and I can relate to that so I figured \""no worries\"". Right away I noticed she had been shaved and not even they had not even blown the hair off. I had to pat a work it off of her when we go outside. It was everywhere to say the least (including my car).  I then put my dog in my car which has light tan leather seats. Half way home I looked down at my dog and she was sitting in a small pool of blood. Come to find out her nails had been cut too high and this was causing a large amount of blood. My first reaction was to go back and ask for help, since they caused the inconvenience. When I returned to the groomers the same annoyed woman seemed even more annoyed and inconvenienced (hilarious I know) by my concern for my dog and my car that was now pretty bloody from the issue. She eventually put something on my dogs paw to help the bleeding subside and gave me some towels to clean the mess. However, never once did this woman say sorry. In fact, she giggled like a ten year old a few times because I am guessing my dogs safety and my car are a big joke. Even after this I was going to go back (I guess I am a sucker for a good deal) and just remind of what happened last time and to be careful of Ginger's nails. I made an appointment 3 DAYS in advance. I even rearranged my entire schedule and woke up at 8am after working until 3am to get them there before my day started. I called to see if they were open and the same condescending woman answered and ask about my appointment. She then told me I would need to furnish shot records. I explained that they are somewhere in a pile of things that need to be filed and I am running out of time before I need to be somewhere else. I asked if they can be faxed or email, she said \""nope\"" and this just angered her more. I explained this was a HUGE inconvenience and I did not understand why no one had brought this up before today, at 9am, right before I was getting ready to drop them off!!!!!!! I eventually grew tired of arguing and told her to go F off (naturally) and hung up. I called back to get her name and she refused to give it to me and also said she owned the place (cough...). This place has a lot of great reviews but that trend will change with a person like that dealing with the public. What should have happened is someone should have called me prior and explained their new policy and not turned this into a grudge match between a PAYING customer and a miserable employee. Beware of this declining establishment!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,One place I would never go back to. It looked like a nice place when we first got there so I guess our expectations were high but the service and food were pretty bad. Crab cakes were mushy and tasted old. The sea scallops were not fresh and not seasoned. We were shocked when we saw a dog in the dining room. The server said that was the owner's dog and it's there every day. I like dogs but I didn't know they were allowed in restaurants when people are dining. This is one place I will never visit again.
0,The layout of this urban outfiiters is awful. It's really hard to shop in. Head office should have a look and completely re-do the interior. The girls section is SUUUPER small and the staff do not keep the clothing organized. It was so disorganized it was difficult to find the clothes and sizes beacuse clothes and styles were just everywhere and sprawled out. It was a horrible nightmare of shopping trying to navigate their sale section. The apartment section took up most of the store which really confused me because it was quite spread out on the second floor. I was jealous of the guys section beacuse it was the nicest most organized part of the store.
0,"Damn you Yelpers you steered me wrong!!  I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.  \n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.\n\nI love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.\n\nThe meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.\n\nWe then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.\n\nI took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.\n\nI did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.\n\nI was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.\n\nAll in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.\n\nOh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )\n\nAnyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out."
0,"Obviously its not the best place to stay when you're in Vegas, but you know what, the service staff is nice, and the location is great! Smack dab in the middle of the strip.. If you don't want to spend a lot of $$ on a hotel room this is the place for you!"
1,"Very delicious! Nice atmosphere and very clean and new inside.....would recommend the calamari, wonton soup and chix fried rice!! Yummy!"
0,"Prices are way high for a breakfast place. Over 25 dollars for two adults. Cute atmosphere, but the food, which sounded unique and delicious on the menu, did not live up to the talk. Super disappointed."
1,"Taco Tuesday ~ enough said!!\nNice people working at this location, good food & always fresh! A line is always present in the drive thru and you never you know who you'll run into inside the restaurant.\nClean place to have a bite OR go for take out! Its nice always being thanked for your business!"
1,"Great location, great servers provide by Mai, thank you for the good deals. Definitely will come back!"
1,"I had dinner here while staying in the Palms this past April. The setting of the restaurant is incredible, it's location at the top of the Fantasy Tower provides diners with breathtaking views of the entire Las Vegas cityscape. The food is very rich but excellent. \n\nI had the butterfly shrimp appetizer (supr-rich but yummy) and Sunday Gravy as an entree which was delicious and very filling. The cocktails are beautifully mixed and my server did a fantastic job- he even got me a comp into the Playboy Club and Moon nightclub!  The high prices on the menu are more than justified by the quality of the food, the excellent service, the overall ambience, and the amazing views. \n\nThis is a fabulous restaurant for a date, a celebratory dinner, or just a classy evening out. Recommended."
1,"Some of the best frozen treats I've had in Vegas! I love fruit flavored desserts and treats which is basically all they sell here. The menu consists of soft serve in flavors like pineapple, mango, and raspberry as well as fancier treats served in a cored out pineapple like the bonzai and pineapple boat. \n\nThe soft serve is full of flavor and dairy free and comes in your choice of a cup or waffle cone for $4.95. The bonzai and pineapple boat are around 10 bucks. Don't forget to get a punch card too to get a free soft serve after 5 punches \n\nThis location is inside the Boulevard Mall food court and is the only reason I ever come to this mall. I hear they're opening additional locations in the future! Can't  wait until I won't have to drive as far!"
0,Went to go in for our first time and it was really bad. The rice was cold and hard. Then beans looked like they were poured straight out of the can. Nothing was hot/warm. Bad quality over all.
0,"Don't use their on line orders, for starters. My son ordered us pizza one night a few weeks ago and when he went in they insisted it had not yet been paid for. He paid for it again despite protesting ( I guess figuring they would see the double order eventually and fix it. Several hours later they called him to ask if he was going to pick up the pizza he ordered. He talked to a manager who said the double charge would be credited to his account. I called a few days later because his card had still not been credited. Again, they stated it would be credited and the delay was \""due to the weekend\"".  It never was credited!\n My son was the one who liked their food (taking into account it's close to home). I find it bland and some of the worst pizza, spaghetti, and other dishes I've had. \n I've had a poor opinion of the staff in past visits. It seems to consist of a bunch of clueless teenagers who are more interested in tending to their boyfriends and girlfriends, who stop in, than the customers. There's always one employee fidgeting with the register or orders who seems confused about how to do the job. One time I remember having to wait forever for an order only to find out they forgot to put it in. \nMy son, who used to do business with them several times a week says he is never buying from them again after this. I'm fine with that. I prefer, Rays, Papa Murphys, Humble Pie (my favorite), Mellow Mushroom or any of the chain pizza places around here. It will be an easy change to not eat this food. \nYea, we could keep calling them until they fix it but I guess he is considering it a $20 lesson. Guess they lost a fair amount of business over $20 worth of bad service, eh?"
1,"A big nod to mojo to en coco.\nI may have found new foreign cuisine love. I never had Venezuelan dishes before. It turns out, they are down right delicious. And the hit sauce is down right hot and delicious. \n\nAt first my novio and I were stuck at the counter. We are both vegetarians, so it was difficult to make entree selections. But the family behind the counter was very helpful for giving us the right substitution and guiding through the menu. They are such nice people!! Wouldn't you love talking to the owners who are enthusiastic about introducing their culture? \n\nWhatever you order, don't forget the two things: tamarindo + hot sauce = happiness."
1,"I have missed the California Foot Spas that are usually $20 for an hour. After readying the reviews on Yelp, I decided to give Henderson China Foot Massage & Reflexology a try. I was not disappointed at all. \n\nI walked in with no appointment on a Saturday night.. I was pleasantly greeted and taken in a privacy screened area. Lisa was great and this experience turned out to be the best massage at a foot spa I have had yet here in Las Vegas."
1,"Came here during a visit to see Uncle Ryan.  My son loved it (3 years old).  We were running out of things to do for him so it was a good find.  This place is great for a couple hours if you have a toddler or young child you want to entertain & tire out.  They also do bday parties, it would probably be good for a small group of kids in that age group.\n\nPros:\nClean\nprice: $8\nindoors so option for any weather/year round\n\nCons:\nIt's relatively small :  there are 4-5 large \""bouncy houses\"" and a toddler room"
0,"High on Attitude...Low on Service..\n\nBy this point, I would have imagined Postino would running better then a Patek Philippe watch....That was not the case last night.  \n\nMy suggestion... Give Postino Central time to hire a service focused staff with a sense of urgency before you come here. \n\nThe arrival of Postino in my 'hood was highly anticipated.  I was hoping the new \""central\"" location would be \""inspired\"" by Postino... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring!  We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which, a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group, so why did it seem so chaotic? \n\nWe found some seats at the bar and waited to be served... and waited... and waited... we counted 3-4 on bar staff... yet the \""main'\"" bartender seemed pre-occupied, and easily distracted.. AHAD?  We were finally acknowledged after 10 mins and placed our orders. \n\n As we looked around, we noticed others at the bar with either an empty drink or no drink at all. (Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant, however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service) \n\nThere was one lucky group at the bar, ( We think they were the original cast from  the movie Sixteen Candles  ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times, maintaining the bartender's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered.  Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff... Hey ...whatever it takes... I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit! \n\nThe bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.  \n\nAlthough we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!\n\nIf I were the owner, .. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker, service focused  and had more personality then anyone at the bar..\n\nI look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have \""ironed out\"" the \""kinks\"".."
1,"This busy bakery has several different pastries, desserts, ice cream, and coffee. We tried the red velvet cupcake and a large chocolate chip cookie. The cupcake was large and moist with delicious tangy cream cheese frosting. The cookie wasn't too hard or too soft, and the chocolate was rich and plentiful. I would definitely stop in again to try their other desserts."
1,Comfortable and clean. The people who work there are always friendly and I never have to worry when dropping the kids off for a movie.
0,"My wife and I went to this office about a year ago for our annual check up.  We weren't thrilled immediately.  If felt like they were interested only in getting us in and out so they could collect their fees.  Still, my wife got glasses and I got a refill of my contacts, with a modified prescription.  Initially all seemed OK, but not too long after I started to need reading glasses to see smaller print.  I figured it was just a normal progression of my eyesight, as that is a common development for most over time.  My wife started getting headaches if she wore her glasses for very long.  She thought that was just a case of adjusting as she hadn't worn glasses, other than reading glasses, before.\n\nNot being happy with the feel of this office, this year we went to a different provider.  The experience was much better, to start.  But, then, we found that the prescriptions of my wife's glasses and my contacts were not correct.  It seems quite unlikely that it was due to changes in our eyes.  The prescription for my wife's glasses was too strong, not too weak, and her eyes did not improve during the past year.  She has new glasses now and her vision is much, much better. \n\nIn my case, with the correct prescription for my contacts, I no longer need reading glasses for most things, and again, the prescription is not as strong as before.\n\nWe are very happy with the new provider and feel we were just a customer to get in and out for this provider."
0,"Sat in the restaurant for 30 minutes without anyone approaching us. My fiance and I were both very hungry and I wanted a cold drink, but no sort of service ever came. We did get at least 5 dirty looks from the wait staff, so if you want to sit for a half hour with nothing but dirty looks from the staff, this is the place for you. Did get to watch football, but the service is a joke. I would avoid at all costs if at all possible."
0,"Just went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck."
0,"Did I order the wrong thing? Or maybe it was an off day? I feel a bit bad for giving them two stars, but honestly: \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" \n\nChicken katsu had skin on every piece, the oil tasted a little off, and they left in a bunch of lousy bits on the meat. My mother was actually gagging from one of the pieces. I pulled off a bunch of inedible things but otherwise managed to finish the rest. What I didn't finish was the macaroni salad, which didn't taste as good as what I'm accustomed to.\n\nPortion size was about what I've come to expect from Hawaiian places for this price. Service was pleasant. Ambiance was mostly hole-in-the-wall, and I feel like I made a mistake sitting under the kinda loud and tinny mono speaker in the ceiling.\n\nWe ended up going somewhere else after this meal and paying for some better food to clean the palate. Too bad."
0,"Have been twice in last 2 months.  This place is on my way home...(work at val vista/202 and live in Queen Creek).  I agree with Renata K's review.  I was not impressed the first time I went.  I had the Arizona Burrito...it was a touch on the greasy side, and really not much overall flavor.  I wouldn't call it bad, just something you could make better at home, therefore NOT worth spending money for.  \nI gave them another try today.  Ordered a Carnitas burrito, because Carnitas is what I compare mexican places by.  \nUnfortunately this was again a burrito with no real flavors.  Very big, but very bland.  From now on I think I will just spend my burrito money at Los Fav's down the street."
1,"Let's just say... When living social came out with coupons, I bought 4. I get the spicy catfish every time and the jalapeno hush puppies are very good. Its another small business that you guys can support and feel good about because they deserve the business.\n\nIf you eat there, you will probably smell like the food they make. It used to be a Quiznos so the atmosphere could put some people off. Just order it to go and you will not be disappointed."
0,"i've rented many cars in many location, but here is the first  to add on additional\ninsurance without my consent, or at least my understanding, making it a very expensive rental. Confusing at best, I notice that I'm not the only one with this experience. There are better options in the same rental hall."
0,"Worst Quest EVER!!!! Do not even bother to go to this location unless you don't mind leaving really pissed off.  Scheduled my appointment weeks in advance for my daughter's allergy test. The day of my appointment (12/26/13) I showed up 20 minutes early and there was no one in the waiting room.  I asked the lady behind the glass window if they can take us right away since my daughter have not had breakfast yet (that was 10:10am).  The lady goes, \""Oh the Phlebotomist is busy with another patient right now\"", again there is no one waiting before I got there and all I can hear from where we were sitting are people laughing in the back room. ARE THEY EVEN WORKING!! Didn't sound like it. I went again to the lady in the front desk because it is already 10:30am (my appointment time) to ask what time are they taking us back and was told that he would be out shortly...REALLY? At 10:40am I was really aggravated that I walked out with my family lest my daughters see me yell at those extremely unprofessional people.  Why even allow people to schedule appointments when the people who work there cannot keep it. \n\nP.S.  The lady who said \""there's a patient in the back\"" and \""that the Phlebotomist will be out shortly\"" did not stand up or do anything. In fact when I first walked up to her, she sounded irritated and asked \""What are you here for?. Like she doesn't want to be at work. Well, hello Quest??? There are a lot of unemployed people out there who are more qualified that her can take her position because it looks like she hates her job!"
1,"Frozen Hot Chocolate is amazing, duh!  It's so overpriced, but that's Vegas for you.  Also try to get one of their giant donuts.  Put these two things together and YOU win."
1,Staff is super friendly. The location is great with a nice shared outdoor seating. The smoothie the cashier suggested was amazing.
1,"I don't know what I could say about Liberty Market that hasn't been said multiple times already.  But here goes. \n\nThe people- helpful, friendly, accommodating.  Always happy to answer a question or to whip up a sample of some tempting little treat.\n\nThe menu- exhaustive. I've yet to try something I didn't love. If you can't find something to eat here, then you must work for the competition!  My go-to meal is the Liberty Bowl with pasta. \n\nThe atmosphere- kitschy, eclectic. The neon, the colors, the espresso machine (more on that in a bit). Plenty of indoor seating. Nice outdoor patio. Bathrooms that are works of art. \n\nParking- can be a little rough, what with all of the other businesses there in downtown Gilbert. \n\nThe Espresso Bar- Oh. My. Goodness. That E61 espresso machine is older than me- and probably most Yelpers (if not any two combined), but wow does it make a delicious shot of espresso!  If you've never had a Cortadito, I highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nGo to Liberty Market. Do it. Do it now. Thank me later."
0,"Silver state Schools Credit Union used to function like a community bank. No longer. Now they use every trick the big banks use to squeeze fees and money out of their \""customer\"" who they treat as suckers."
1,"I adore the employees that work here. They are incredibly helpful and chipper. I was sold on their incredible customer service when they pumped air into a knee scooter for me. (No charge! Happened right away!) \n\nRecently I dropped off a bike to be assembled and serviced. Actually, that's not true. Hamilton, my bud, carried the ginormous box from my car into the store. (Hey, I held the door open!) I explained that Bee (my yellow bike) had been accumulating dust back east for years and had a flat tire. I was pleased to hear how fairly priced the work c/would be. (They would examine my bike and ring me with a final course of action before starting the work.)\n\nAdditionally, with no judgement over my lack of exercise, Hamilton explained how the green goop sealant works. (My technical term. I heard \""mwah mwah mwah\"" but now understand what to do if I have a flat.)\n\nMy bike was ready in a few days ... and is now sitting unused in my apartment. \n\nEr-\n\nFocusing on the important stuff, this joint is great!"
1,"Ah STK the place to be seen and to mingle. As soon as you walk into this restaurant you notice all the beautiful people, loud music, and dim atmosphere. The hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. You order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. But is it worth all the hype and the $$$? \n\nService - Our waitress was awesome. She was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. She was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. I was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. They also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. Side note: Just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. Tap & Sparkling do not mix well.\n\nFood - Within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with a complimentary Parmesan Garlic Roll and it's dipping oil, which I can't remember what it was off the top of my head. The roll wasn't bad. \n\nWe order our cocktails and appetizers - Tuna Tartare & Foie Gras French Toast. Phenomenal! Both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. The Tuna Tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a taco shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. The Foie Gras French Toast was balanced excellently. The toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a poached apple made happy time in my mouth! I highly recommend these two apps. \n\nWe then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of Parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed Alaskan crab legs. The fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if I say so myself. The mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. They bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. The Alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how I miss the Northwest! \n\nNow for the main entree- for being a steakhouse I was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. It was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! A little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. Maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. However, I'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. The waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly I wasn't impressed by them. The flavor was so bland. The mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still lacked flavor. Word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. I couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (Best Mac & Cheese: StripSteak's truffle mac & cheese). \n\nWait still not done! We had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole STK experience. We ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pudding. If you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. I did like the bread pudding but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in the caramel syrup. The Captain Crunch addition to the bread pudding was quite interesting. \n\nWhen all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. We easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full STK experience. Overall, a cool place to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have a couple hours to kill...our dinner lasted over 2 hours. \n\nSide notes:  The timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. I feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. The steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. Be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender. Make reservations as it can get crowded."
1,"This place has something I've never eaten before: a cold-hot chocolate. The \""cold intense\"" is heaven in a cup. Seriously mind-blowing if you're a fan of chocolate - the thickest, most decadent stuff you can sip on. Everyone has to have at least one sip of this stuff in a lifetime. You can get it cold in the summer and hot in the winter, and I cannot decide which one is better!!"
1,"I really should have updated this review a long time ago.  When Dragon I first opened the food was consistently good but the service was indescribably awful.  Actually, it was pretty hilarious.   I once waited for 45 minutes because, unbeknownst to me, they were waiting for a frozen block of seaweed salad to (partially) thaw.  \n\nIn any case, that's all in the past.  The original clowns who were worked here are all gone and now it's really quite well-run.  And the food is generally--though not always-- pretty decent.  Definitely a good choice for a big bowl of pho."
1,"Love their chai tea. The expansion and additions in recent years have been really nice. I remember several occasions when I couldn't find a seat anywhere. So thankful that's not the case now - thanks for expanding! The noise level is usually low enough for working or studying, and the music selection is good.\n\nMy only complaint is the vibe given off by some of the employees. A few times I have felt almost unwelcome in the coffee shop. I am placing my order and the employee could not care less. The \""too cool for you,\"" hipster standoffish attitude can come across unpleasant. Where is the customer service? Smile more, I promise you everything is awesome!"
0,"This was the 3rd salon I tried out in Vegas after Diva's Studio and Limelight Salon. I came in for a a cut only. The stylist I had was real nice, and at that time had 2 years experience for hair. I asked for a bob cut. I liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair. My hair was shorter than I wanted and I wasn't too impressed by how the bob turned out. I wasn't too thrilled I spent $55 for it either. \n\nI guess it's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here...Just not for me."
0,"Worst. Buffet. Ever.\nNah, I'm sure there are bound to be equally bad buffets in our great nation, but the Emperor's Buffet is surely in the running. Let me preface this review by saying that the staff deserves a good four stars, as they were very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, from the defeated looking carving chef, to the tiki masks in a chinese themed restaurant, everything else about htis buffet was substandard. Chicken noodle soup without noodles, egg drop soup that didn't appear to have any eggs in it, prime rib that was bloody red and tasted it, most everything else dry or overcooked; sad, sad, sad. My wife said \""Well, the mashed potatoes aren't bad\""; if the mashed potatoes were the best thing on your menu (and they weren't-the soft serve ice cream was), you have got a serious problem. The decor, as mentioned, is from the wrong part of the world, and that attention to detail seems to infect the whole dining area. If I hadn't just spent 2 hours starving in an airport shuttle waiting to get to the Imperial Palace, and another hour getting checked in, I would have had the energy to seek out another place to eat (like Hash House A Go-Go, fifty feet in the opposite direction). I won't waste any more time on this, so my ratings: Staff - B, Decor - D-, Food - F"
0,"I will first say we only ordered pizza and have never come in for a full dinner so perhaps this is unfair to review but this was my experience. Very friendly and cute little restaurant and the menu looked pretty good from what I saw online, but we only wanted a pie to go. I gotta say, we were disappointed. I was skeptical about brick oven because generally speaking the best pizza does not come out of a brick oven. We have tried most of the local pizza joints and have not had good luck of late and we try our best to stay away from the national chains. I wanted to like the pizza, but it just wasn't very good. The crust was so thin it was soggy everywhere but the edges. The edge crust was tasty and that was the highlight, which ironically is usually the least enjoyable part of a pizza. Since the crust was so thin and soggy in the middle, it did not fill us up and it could not support much sauce or toppings either. Pizza is supposed to have a thin crust, but that doesn't mean it should be so thin that its soggy and without structure enough to hold a tasty sauce, cheese and toppings. I've lived in different parts of Charlotte and for some reason all the good places are up on the northern side of town. I guess we'll have to start driving a little further for it. I give up on any place south of Harris Blvd."
0,"We had dinner at Blue Ribbon during Restaurant Week 2012.  First off I have to say - the service was super friendly and our waiter was funny and knowledgeable about everything on the menu from food to sake. Personally, I think he was the best part of the meal.\n\nAfter checking out the prix fixe menu choices for RW, I decided on getting the Cream Of Chinese Broccoli Soup with blue crab, the Spicy Tuna Roll, the Seared Ono and Ginger Bread Pudding. \n\nThe soup was nice, served in an earthen-ware crock garnished with cilantro and topped with what I think the waiter said cilantro cream. Thick and comforting, with the chinese broccoli giving it a deep green color and big presence.  The chunks of blue crab were large enough and tasty enough to be a nice foil against the dense broccoli flavors.  Very nice little soup.\n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll was small, but good.  Nothing mind-bendingly stellar, but good.  \n\nThe Ono was served beautifully seared and topped with cucumber, cilantro and red onions in a tart-sweet vinegary broth.  The serving was super generous and the fish done perfectly.  Good dish overall, but the flavors were a bit watery I found.  My husband got the fried chicken with honey wasabi dipping sauce - and when I tasted his sauce, it seemed watery to me as well.  I guess I'm just a gal that likes bigger, bolder flavors.\n\nThe  biggest downside was the clientele.  I knew this was a casual restaurant going in - and thought it would be a cool place to check out after work that doesn't require dressing to the nines.  The space is nicely decorated, modern and hip - but the two-tops are so close together that we could readily hear the, ehem, \""businessmen\"" next to us loudly discussing the way  to success - with one giving the other advice so that he didn't get his \""d*ck whacked\"" - amongst other doucheyness.  Really???\n\nGood excuse for checking out the Cosmopolitan finally - but for the top tier price of $50.12 a person I've had much better Restaurant Week meals and experiences elsewhere."
1,"I didn't want to write a review until I finished my special tasting.  It was very good, I only had a few problems...but we'll get there later.  This will be my first review since I have to go as a regular patron soon. This place has a very nice atmosphere and I love how they present their meny. Under 475 calories, but let's remember that's PER ITEM lol. that doesn't mean your whole meal will be reasonable.  You actually can go over your daily alotted calories ha! \nThe tasting menu wasn't bad, I of course had to be the bad 'vegetarian' apple and ask for no chicken since a meatless dish wasn't provided. But they do have options for us veggies!\nDefinitely give this place a try!"
1,"One word: TONY. \n\nThis man is insanely talented! My husband and I had only been in the Valley for a few years and were researching tattoo artists. Sometimes I find it best when seeing tattoos from an artist in person on a living canvas instead of in a portfolio. One of my friends has her sleeves done by Tony and I was very impressed so I went to him for my legs and half sleeve.\n\nKnowing what Tony can do, I put my full trust in him and let him have a lot of free reign of the creativity. I feel like that's when artists truly flourish! \n\nEverywhere I go, I get compliments on my half sleeve and when I say who it is, there's been quite a few people who've said, \""Oh yeah, Tony at Lady Luck. I should have known!\"""
0,"Batista's was recommended to my husband and myself by a coworker and I wish we hadn't heeded her suggestion...\n\nThe ambiance in the place was cluttered and cloistering.   I get what they are going for, an obviously have been working on it forever, but the place could really use a sprucing up after all these years...\n\nThere are no menus they are just plastered on the walls ...EVERY wall. Entrees run $28 to $38 dollars and include free house wine (which should be a trigger) soup or salad, garlic bread, a pasta side if your entee does not include pasta, and a cup of cappuccino.\n\nMaybe I'm a food snob, but this place needs Kitchen Nightmares called on it!  To start with, the free house wine tasted like grape juice and vinegar and was completely undrinkable. The salad was served overdressed in Italian dressing, which made the lettuce soggy.  This was the oddest salad I'd ever been served.  It included a single black olive, a single grape tomato, one whole pepperoncini, sliced carrots, a huge slice of salami, and a big chunk of cheese.  The \""garlic\"" bread did not taste of garlic at all. It just tasted like Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning on really greasy bad bread.  My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and he said that the shrimp was pretty good but the rest was just average. I ordered the chicken parmesan. The pasta side dish with cooked fine and the sauce was not bad. The chicken was cooked properly but the giant hunk of melted mozzarella did nothing to cover up the fact that the breading on the chicken soggy and tasteless.   The topper was the side of creamed spinach... call 1973 they want their side dish back!  Our water was served in plastic cafeteria cups and the cup of cappuccino at the end of the meal was served in a plastic mug.  It tasted like powdered cappuccino mix, but was honestly probably the best part of the meal!\n\nI would give Battista's 1 star for the food but the service was not bad so I'm giving them 2.  What we thought might be a rare gem off the strip turned out to be nothing to write home about...  Don't bother wandering off to a bad part of town looking for good food... stay in your hotel.. there's bound to be better food there!"

1,Best coffee I've had in a long time! And the breakfast burrito and homemade almond croissant were incredible!! Thanks Jullie!
0,Food was ok and the service was horrible. I love Moe's but if this was my first experience with the chain it would be my last.
0,"Are you people insane?  If you think that Panda Express is good Chinese food, then you must also think Sbarro is awesome Italian food.  This place is at best a decent option at an airport.  The chicken dishes are stringy.  The beef dished are tough.  Their fried rice is bland.  If you are stuck somewhere and this is the only option, it will not make you sick.  If you are not stuck somewhere, please yelp a non-chain Chinese option."
1,I love the Encore!! This hotel is top notch! I can't wait to go stay there again. The rooms were so gorgeous and comfortable. I stayed in the Resort King Suite. The room was really classy and spacious. The bathroom had his and her sinks with a gorgeous glass shower.  The entire hotel was beautifully decorated with multicolored butterflies and red accents. The location was really convenient. You can walk across the street and go to the fashion show mall. You could also walk to the Venetian pretty easily. There is a very conveniently located bridge to the Venetian next to a beautiful waterfall. I had a fabulous time there. I suggest this hotel to anyone that wants to have a relaxing time in a nice hotel in Vegas. It is simply delightful.
0,"I would definitely suggest coming to the Mandalay Bay pool if you're with your family or kids. The crowd is much younger and more family oriented. That being said, I wasn't extremely impressed with Mandalay Bay's pool. All of the hype from the lazy river, to the intricately connected pools, to the wave pool I expected more. We reserved a cabana for the day so it was nice that we had our own space to relax and to not worry about us leaving our area without our belongings getting stolen or our chairs getting taken."
1,"Alot of people hate dealing with car dealerships, auto repair shops, etc because most of the time they feel like they are being ripped off, talked to like they are idiots, or the interaction with the people are just more trouble than its worth. I am a shade tree mechanic and absolutely hate letting anybody else touch my car as i do 90% of my own work and trust very few. Tires happen to be one of those things you cant do yourself because of the machines involved and for that i usually go to Discount Tire. After a very negative experience at the West Flamingo location where i honestly was told i don't know what i am talking about i wrote a letter to the Discount Tire office and was contacted by a district manager who sent me to the location off Blue Diamond across from Silverton. This is where i met BILL the manager of this store and his crew, who when i arrived promptly cared for my car and listened to me about the difficulties with my particular set of wheels (rather than not listening and telling me im wrong like the other store). I wan mounting a tricky set of high end forged wheels that required some extra parts and sensors for the car they were being mounted to which is why it took 3 separate times for me to go back and forth the the store to finally get the job completed. During the different times i returns there were bottlenecks that needed to be addressed but at no time did i feel like the store and its crew ever did not have a hold of the work that was being performed, it was just a matter of my parts being difficult. In the end all work was performed and completed and their patience with my job was appreciated as i know its not the typical mount and balance on a Ford Focus. I have now found my go to people for tire labor and will recommend them highly for the customer service and patience.... walk in and ask for BILL."

0,"If you're looking for a good night's rest, DO NOT STAY AT THE ARTISAN!!! \nThe desk clerk informed me upon check in that they have the \""biggest after hours club in Vegas\"". This made me nervous for good reason. From 2am until 8am you can hear the the music, and that's with ear plugs. If that's not enough, you can be kept awake by the drunk clubbers yelling in the parking lot, peeling out in their cars. \nTired and hungry upon arrival, I ordered a  flat bread pizza & a beer from room service. The pizza was disgusting! The dough was barely cooked . and all the toppings slid off when I picked it up. How do you fuck up pizza? They add a $3 service charge, plus a tip and then leave a line for you to write in a tip (very deceptive), so this added an additional $9 to my bill. $26 for a pizza appetizer and a beer. \nI was not happy when I checked out and let the manager know. They waived the questionable $10 \""resort fee\"" for both nights and basically told me they were doin' me a big favor by doing so. \nI would never stay here again. They're throwing their guest under the bus to cater to club goers. It's too bad because it's reasonably priced and is furnished well. It is, however in the middle of an industrial park and cost between $15-$20 to get anywhere."
0,"I went there again had the Margarita pizza. \n\nIt was soggy, and tasted like a wet foot. The sauce wasn't good and the grated Parmesan tasted like cheap kraft in the green can. \n\nThey say the house make the mozzarella, that confuses me because it is super oily?\n\nIf you use quality mozzarella its not like that. You use whole milk.\n\nSo this is one of the worst pizzas ever. I'm sticking to Grimaldis, better pizza, better salad."
0,"If I can rate SLS Las Vegas Hotel -100 Stars I would!!!!!! The room are so so tiny, the floor is dusty, stains everywhere, on towels, bed sheet, table, and couch... Both bed side lights had no light bulb, lol yes, no light bulb in there! I was so excited to stay here because I had amazing time at the SLS Beverly Hills. However,  after I checked in this so call brand new renovated hotel, I feel so uncomfortable to stay because our room is beyond dirty, dusty and unfinished. I will never come back for SLS LV because you paid for a brand new hottest Las Vegas hotel cost, but only got local motel status! Everything was outdated... \n\nFYI I stayed at the Lux tower king suit, avg. $220 per night after taxes plus resort fees. I tried to upgrade to a SLS king suite, they said it's $700 per night, please see my pictures, the $700 Suite doesn't have light bulb either. So, needless to say, SLS Las Vegas, What a shame..."
1,"Another convenient gift shop with trendy gifts and cards for all occasions. Granted most of them are more girlie it's certainly more upmarket than your average Edward monkton corner store.  From funky china, to sweet candles and other quirky ideas I tend to  head here if I am stuck on gift ideas for friends.\n\nI particularly like the unique card selection- some of them could make gifts on their own. The layout of the store makes it very convenient to browse for seemingly hours."

1,"This is an amazing laser salon! I've heard some horror stories of people getting burned after treatments, but this is my second time going and it has been smooth sailing! I did my face/neck combo and it took about a week to really see the results because it takes the hair follicle that long to come off. I just did my second treatment and looking forward to finishing the rest so I can do something else =) . Ani (the owner) was really friendly, but she is doing more marketing for her business and make it expand. Everyone there was really friendly and the prices were just right.  They don't force you into buying packages like some places - so you pretty much pay as you go. I prefer it that way because you have options (which I like). Their prices are really reasonable and there is a breakdown on their website. I paid $105 for my neck and face. It takes about 6 sessions to really become hair free. This is my go-to laser salon and I highly encourage everyone to go!  There is some pain with any procedure like this, but all tolerable! Take a Tylenol an hour before you go and you can survive it!\n\nThanks again Ivy Laser Salon! I am looking forward to your next location ( hopefully in North Las Vegas)."
0,"This review is not pertaining to the services I received from Djanel. Unfortunately, I did not even make it that far into the business transaction. I called to schedule a massage because I had heard and read positive things about Djanel Spa. Further, the prices were reasonable compared to most of the hotels/spas. While making the appointment, I informed the person I was speaking to that I preferred a female masseuse. He replied that he did not have any female masseuses available for 5 weeks because he had conventions and weddings to attend to. Peculiar, I thought, but no problem, sir. \n\nI told him that 5 weeks would put us into the month of January and I would be happy to schedule an appointment with a female during that time. He replied that he could not promise anything especially a female masseuse and that he does not schedule appointments that far ahead. He stated that he would not even want to \""promise a glass of orange juice\"" that far ahead. He went on stating that it should not matter who gives me a massage and that I should be happy with whomever I receive a massage from; \""I have been in business for over 25 years and this is not a normal request...\"" At this time, I simply stated that I would take my business elsewhere.\n\nJudging from what other people have stated, this is a solid spot to receive spa \nservices. I was disappointed that I could not experience \""25 years of business.\"" Instead and judging from context, I received an earful of metaphors and anecdotes from the owner."
1,"My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me.\n\nI started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh.\n\nNext, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful.\n\nAfter having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :) \n\nI received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!"
1,"I enjoy trying different types of foods from different places and the S&D Polish Deli really provides that.  This is a cute little place on the strip with women who actually speak the language. The setup is a bit odd, the tables unstable and honestly they all needed a good wipe down. I asked for and did my table myself. Oh well, they weren't perfect.\n\nOn to the food! I went with the Polish Platter which consisted of Halupki, perogies, a mammoth pig in the blanket and a drink. I did get a extra pig because I have portion issues. Plus my W refuses to make them because we aren't polish. What kind of reason is that?! Anyway, the food was well seasoned and hot on the plate. Also, the lunch was $11 which isn't too bad for the strip. Hope you enjoy my picture. :)"
1,"Spend the weekend at this hotel, I couldn't be any happier. \nThe room is very comfortable, but what make this hotel special is the service. A car with a driver ready to take you anywhere you want in downtown for free' call back when you're done and he'll pick you up. The food is delicious and the staff is very accommodating."
1,"Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to The Living Room with my sisters-in-law. \n\nAtmosphere: 4 Stars. \nI really liked this place. The place is very neat... garage doors that let the cool night air in and the little details of the place are cool. \nThe only thing that would have made it better is if they had some soft lighting after dark. It was so dark inside around 8pm that I couldn't read the drink menu. \n\nService: 1 Star. \nI think this place might hire people more for their looks than their actual skills at service. Our waitress was scarce until it came time to pay the bill. \n\nDrinks: 4 Stars. Pricey, but very good. I had the Red Sangria (blah! nothing special) and a peach martini. The martini was delicious and very strong which is a good thing when I'm paying $8 for it. I think next time I'll probably only have drinks here at Happy Hour. $8 for a small Sangria is a bit expensive for me. \n\nFood: 4 Stars. \nWe started with two Bruschetta (steak and Gorgonzola; apple and fig). Very delicious! Next time, I'll probably stick to Bruschetta because they were so good. For dinner, I got 1/2 of a Prosciutto and Brie sandwich and a cup of Butternut Squash soup. The sandwich had one slice of fatty Prosciutto and a thin layer of Brie. Disappointing. The soup was EXCELLENT! If you like Butternut Squash soup, I'd recommend trying it here. \n\nI'll be going back again... probably during Happy Hour next time!"

0,"Overly sentimental, non stop references to her kids, how blessed she is, and her husband.... too many covers from elite performers like Stevie Wonder.... Billy Joel...Tina Turner.  Why is she not just playing her music.. as an elite performer herself?  A weird duet sung between herself and a computer generation of herself... and then back to back with another one...a computer generated Stevie Wonder this time -  so cheesy.   Horrible, phoned in attempt at being humorous and connecting with audience between songs- while an enormous projection of her face is made on the curtain- to see her \""funny\"" facial expressions.  (Kind of like end of Wizard of Oz.)  Still has that great voice.    \n\nI would have giggled my way through the show laughing at it---- save for the totally aggressive Canadian fans sitting near me.  ... like Red Sox fans.   I just totally don't get the show.  It's like a parody of a real show..."
1,"For $10 you get chicken katsu, rice, miso soup, and a cabbage salad. Everything was amazing! Who would of thought to grind up sesame seeds into the katsu sauce?!? It was delicious! I also ordered soft shell crab appetizer which was amazing! Thanks to my friend Jessica for taking me there! I am definitely going back again!"
0,"We bought a 2011 Lexus at Bell.  Our sales associate was very professional and knowledgeable.  Unfortunately, the finance manager was right out of a movie.

0,"Words cannot describe how I felt about this restaurant but I am going to try!\nFirst off the hostess was not friendly at all and I would almost say RUDE.  I ordered the Italian soup with spinach and egg and it looked like I threw up my egg and spinach omelet from breakfast.  Of the four entrees we ordered nothing was good and very small portions!  The prices were so high and the portions were very small........a BIG tourist trap for sure!!!!\nI am warning everyone, do not go to this restaurant unless you want to be bent over!\nGianfrancos should be ashamed to call themselves a restaurant.\nDefinitely two thumbs down!i would rather have gone to Olive Garden and save my money!!!!!"
0,"I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said \""uhh it's at the bar!\"" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only."
1,"I have found the food and service in this store to be excellent on every visit. On our last visit Angelica took a few minutes to dialogue with us about Five Guys, and discuss our guest experience during our current visit. It was great to meet someone who is passionate and dedicated to customer service! Thanks Angelica"
1,Fantastic food and atmosphere. Service is great too and everything feels just right. Only thing is that the process differed in my case from the bill to the menu and the appetisers given were a bit stingy.
0,"While in Vegas, I wanted a really nice steak dinner. Got a $50 restaurant.com gift certificate which enticed us to choose here. Visited mid-January on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend. Had reservations at 5:30pm as we had to catch a show at 8:30pm. \n\nWe arrived right on time and were seating promptly. The hostess was neither welcoming or off putting. The restaurant was pretty busy for an early Sunday evening. \n\nIt took a long time for our waiter to come over and get us both menus and drinks. After we got our drinks, it took a full half-an-hour before he took our order. We did get the Duck Fat Fries which were heavenly. \n\nInitially, they messed up our apps and brought us an incorrect one. It wasn't until I corrected them that we our food that we ordered. We started with the Lobster Fritters and Hamachi Sashimi. I thought the fritters were alright, maybe too indulgent. The sashimi was great, huge portions. \n\nNext, I got the Kansas City Strip and my girlfriend got the Filet Mignon. My steak was less than stellar and under cooked. Her filet was good though. We also got the Potato Puree Trio, which was good but we didn't care for the horseradish ones. \n\nDessert was an Apple Crumble and Cheesecake. The crumble was delicious while the cheesecake was blah. \n\nThe whole meal took two hours, way too long in my opinion. Our waiter was very nice though but may have been overrun with too many tables. The busser was great as dirty dishes never sat and water glasses never were empty. We also had a mix up on the check, which was frustrating when time was an issue, but we got it straightened out. \n\nBill was $175 w/ tip after the gift certificate. \n\nUltimately, did I get a delicious steak dinner? No. For $175 for two, I expect way more. Especially since there are so many other steak house options in Las Vegas. While the $50 gift certificate is nice, I would pay the full $50 for a mouth watering steak, which I didn't get. Disappointment with my steak and slow service won't have me returning to Stripsteak the next time I'm in Las Vegas.\n\nNOTE: We went to Fleur the night before. Although not a steak house, if you're in Mandalay Bay, I highly recommend it over Stripsteak."
1,"First off, food was great.  I ordered the Steak Bordelaise and it was solidly cooked and seasoned.  Had a little bit of everyone else's food and that was good too.  I only had one gripe about this place.  I don't know if it was me or because I had one too many glasses of scotch but is it too dark in there?!?"
0,"Wow. I ordered 2 sandwiches and one of them was adequate, but the other one  (for my husband) had 1 thin slice of ham and 1 thin slice of turkey on it. Way too much lettuce and barely any mayo. Completely tasteless.  Step it up guys!  There is a Capriotti's less than a mile away that never disappoints!"
0,"Wound up here after Blues was closed for a private function.  The DC restaurant has great BBQ, so though we would try this place.  The meat was very salty and mine was dried out.  I expect spices on ribs, but these had been in the heater too long. Smallish drinks for Vegas, and the atmosphere is weird...more like a food court than a restaurant."

1,"It's hard to beat the whole IKEA atmosphere and shopping experience. I still get a whiff of excitement when I step into the showroom -- less so than when I first set foot in the new store, but it's still there. Maybe it's the heady aroma of particle board, golf pencils, meatballs, and screaming kids waiting in line for Smland... not sure?\n\nThe upstairs showroom is really the best part of IKEA. They change it up enough that it's interesting on repeat visits. If I ever get crammed into a 300 sq ft living enclosure in Prague, I'll be all set as far as decorating ideas. The restaurant is still cool. Shame people can't seem to get on board with the whole \""clear your own table\"" thing, because there are always messes around when I go there. Where else can you get lingonberry soda though, really. \n\nOne lingers in the showroom because you know that somewhere in the distant future you have to get to the downstairs part where you actually buy stuff and lift hundreds of pounds of flat, wide boxes into your cart and eventually your vehicle. They design the boxes this way so you can fit them in your Peugot or MINI, despite the fact that most Americans have more cargo space than your average Boeing 747. Frankly, I'd rather the boxes be shaped like dumbbells or body bags so at least I can lift something I've had practice with.\n\nOh, IKEA. Here is where you lose a star. The self check-out is absolutely revolutionary but it cannot dominate the commerce area. You have one full-service checkout for the absolutely soulless but everything else is self. I love it personally, because I can get out of there without the faffing and inane chatter that goes along with interacting with a clerk. But the masses simply cannot or will not bring their A-game when it comes to the scanners and payment devices. It requires a delicate symphony of grabbing merch, getting those lasers lined up right, bagging, paying. Lasers! People cannot merge onto I-10 correctly, let alone cope with lasers.\n\nAt least create Expert, Intermediate, Beginner, and Hopeless lanes so we can self-identify and get out of Dodge."
0,"I'm giving Catch 22 all of one star, mainly because who I think might be the new owner/manager decided that the group I was there to watch football with this morning wasn't all that important enough for their business and he decided to talk down to one lady in our group because she was setting up a wireless tower to get sound and he thought she was doing it wrong.  Turned out to be bad wifi from Catch 22, however he couldn't admit it.  Furthermore, when I asked if we could have our game on the big screen he replied \""nope, that is not happening\"" and then gave me some BS excuse of how the wiring in the place is all connected and how certain tvs can't go to another channel without other tvs there going to the same channel.  Interesting how other sports bars can get it right, however they can't.  The tone of his answer to me couldn't have been more condescending.  And seriously, if we were told we get a separate place in the restaurant with our own tv then why should we have to bring our own sound to a sports bar???\n\nAt the end of the day, we were pretty much treated like second class patrons.  The food is somewhat ok at best, last week our group had lousy service, and whomever was in-charge of the place this morning was a real (rhymes with \""Rick\"") to us.  Never going back there again."
0,"Dear Lord, I could have easily spared myself the humiliation by not letting the world know that I stayed here. \n\nOn a super last minute trip to Vegas this past January, Circus Circus was the best deal we could find for the week we were going (CES convention= $$$ for hotels) and with the amount of broke people going with us. \n\nMy friends and I booked to stay in the \""Manor Rooms.\"" Little did we know that these rooms were actually across from the main building/tower (as if we weren't far enough away from the center of the strip). \n\nPositives:\n-Spacious! Lots of room for luggage and moving around\n-Fridge! So rare in Vegas rooms, unless you're splurging on a suite or whatever. This kept all our booze nice and cold.\n-Self-parking\nNegative:\n-Broken hairdryer, iron, and light. We called the hotel about these issues and the person  they sent over to fix it never came. \n-I know its only across the street from the main tower but staying in these rooms didn't make us feel like we were in Vegas whatsoever! \n\nBottom Line: will not stay here again. ever."
0,"This review is strictly on the food.  I went to Which Wich yesterday and the ordering process was very unique and fun, but the sandwich I had was nothing to write home about.  I had a meatloaf sandwich under the \""comfort classics\"" or \""comfort food\"" category and it was gross.  The meatloaf was absolutely devoid of any flavor and just tasted like a flavorless ground beef wad.  I mean, I had cheeses and other spices that should've enhanced the meatloaf, but how can you enhance flavors when they are absent? No salt, no pepper, no ketchup coating, NOTHING! I'm not going to give up on Which Wich just because of this first bad experience, but it failed for me this go around."

1,"My first trip to Fast Eddies exceeded my expectations for breakfast at a Diner. \nWe were greeted as soon as we crossed the threshold by friendly smiling faces and were promptly seated. \nThe building reminds me of a remodeled Mexican restaurant, but displays bright colors  with assorted \""flair\"" hung on the walls, from humorous placards to framed pictures of locals and their hot rods. \nThe dining area is split into 2 main rooms one of which has the long bartop eating with stools you'd expect to see at a diner.\nIt was around 9:30 on a Thursday morning, there were plenty of open seats. \nAs soon as we were sat we placed our drink order and received menus. It's an easy to read one piece laminated menu ala Waffle House.\nI first noticed that all the breakfast options were affordable on a low budget and they even have daily specials with reduced prices.\nI'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast, I don't like pancakes which are usually forced on you as a side. Not at Fast Eddies. You have a choice of pancakes, biscuit and gravy, hashbrowns and toast or fruit. My ideal breakfast includes eggs, a meat item, a potato item, and toast. I could order this dream plate, at Fast Eddies without making any substitutions or paying for sides. \nI ordered the corned beef hash and eggs (over medium) ,hashbrowns (topped with cheese is standard) and sour dough toast.\nIt couldn't have even been 5 minutes before our piping hot plates were brought to the table, I was shocked. \nSurveying my plate I was pleased to see the corned beef hash was crispy top and bottom and didn't look like a pile of raw hamburger. My eggs were cooked perfectly, solid whites with running yolks. The hashbrowns could have been crisper in my opinion but I'm sure that's something you can request. Two large pieces of soft sourdough toast, was served with fluffy whipped butter and a choice of jellies. \nThe portions were impressive and my food was delicious, the hash had just the right level of salt and melted in my mouth. I used the last scrap of toast to completely wipe the plate clean. There was no evidence food was served on it.\nOur waiter handled the payment swiftly and we were in and out in less than a half hour. Each employee we passed on the way out, smiled big and offered a friendly goodbye. \nI WILL eat here again, there were multiple menu items I wanted but unfortunately can only put down one plate per visit. Fast Eddies was fast, affordable and delicious."
0,"While it's a beautiful place, we had a highly unfortunate experience here. Though we prepaid for our reservation 10 days in advance, they gave away our room and stuck us in a smoking room, which REEKED. To our discredit, we did check in very late. However, we received no phone call before they gave the room away.\n\nWhen we complained, they offered to give us some ozone machines, but otherwise couldn't (or wouldn't) do anything else for us except offer us a refund. I don't mind that the answer was no, but the manner in which we were treated implied that WE were the jerks and they did nothing wrong. \n\nAlso, when you book a room, note the mandatory \""amenity fee\"", which I really feel is a  sneaky way of saying the rooms are $28 a night more expensive than some us think they are.\n\nI've been in nicer hotels than this, and I don't think the amenities at this location are particularly impressive, so I feel it's just a cheap trick. \n\nThe room was very nice, though I was a little disappointed at the quality of the linens. I'm used to better at these prices.\n\nOverall? Meh."
0,"Three days after I graduated from high school, I thought it was a great idea to get pierced. I had just got to Vegas for my annual summer break at my dad's house, and with my new-found freedom I headed over to Diversity.\n\nAs a young 18-year old, this was the only tattoo-piercing shop I knew of as it was right by the mall. I should've thought about it more, but I was just too anxious to get it done.\n\nI wanted to get pierced in a pretty private area of my body, so the piercer (who was rude, but I brushed it off because I was just so excited) led me to a private room inside which he said no one could see. As he was doing measuring with my top off, I was looking out onto the afternoon rush-hour of Decauter Blvd. Since it was a private room, I thought the windows worked like one-way mirrors.\nBOY, WAS I WRONG!!!! About a week later, I drove by the shop again and saw that you can see everything inside the windows!!! I was mortified, especially because I was remembering how I was looking down into an older woman's car as she was stopped right under the window during my piercing.\n\nAdditionally, I had done some research on my piercing on the internet and I brought up some of the concerns I had. I asked about the suggestion of using barbells instead of rings because of the size of my body part of choice. The piercer brushed me it off and said it was not true.\n\nNine months later, which by then I thought it should have healed, my piercings were pushing out! The piercer was WRONG.My worst fears for my piercings had come true.\nI ended up taking them out (after one completely pushed out) and having to get re-pierced a few years later. My new piercer said that I was right to begin with, and I should've walked out the first time when he didn't listen. He pierced me with barbells, and my piercings have been happy for the past six years.\n\nI could've been saved a lot of pain, suffering, and having to repierce scar tissue if the jerks at Diversity listened.... Or if I had listened to my common sense and left."
1,"After attending the Super Run Classic Car Show in downtown Henderson last weekend, I am a fan of local events.The Super Run Classic Car Show transformed Water Street into a classic car museum filled with people. The cars included a 1923 Ford coexisting with a Chevy El Camino, a Plymouth Road Runner, 1978 Trans Am, and every classic car imaginable. Just like a good museum, the cars included information about their year and make. A good number of the cars had the hoods popped open to display the engines. The vehicle owners were there to share information. There was even a stand displaying hundreds of Match Box and Hot Wheels cars for sale.\n\n  The Super Run Classic Car Show featured a few food concessions plus a beer garden. They sold corn dogs, smoothies, hot dogs, burgers, sausages, and fries. Personally I have mixed feelings about the food concessions in downtown events. My understanding is that the events are entertainment that helps stimulate the downtown economy. On Water Street so much of the downtown economy is restaurants and bars.  I'd do my part by supporting the Cafe in the El Dorado, the Coffee House, and the Gold Mine Tavern because they plan to be in the community for the long run. Besides, lately I'm not too crazy over the taste of carnival food.\n\n  In my reporting of the Super Clasic Car Show, what made Super Run Classic Car Show shine was that it made Water Street shine. I never saw Water Street so happening on a weekend afternoon. For a day Water Street looked like US 66 when GTOs ruled the road. A Water Street that is usually empty on a Sunday morning was\u00a0animated\u00a0with people. These people were supporting local businesses. From my observation, business was up on Water Street. There was even a 15 minute wait to eat in the Cafe. It also seemed that the casinos and bars were busier.\n\n    When I look back on the Super Run Car Show, I think of how it made Water Street shine on a weekend afternoon  When I look back on this event, I look forward to more local events."
1,"After a rocky start this AM when someone came into our room at 6:45 AM the assistant Front Desk manager, Robert S, a customer service superstar upgraded us to a bigger better suite in response and sincerely apologized - we had a stellar day at the pool and then at the Blackjack tables! \nStarting to love New York New York Las \nVegas again."
1,"The Ritz Carlton in Montreal is simply perfection. Unbeknownst to us they finished a $200MM renovation last October. The minute you enter the hotel, the scent is one of luxury. The service is a 10. The hallways are wide and spacious and the rooms are the nicest I have ever stayed in. Each room is equipped with the latest in technology from floor lights that follow you during the night, to the top of the line Toto toilet, to the blackout shades....the hair dryers are even the best I have seen in a hotel. The beds are exquisite as are the towels and showers. The bath products were even luxurious. I would go back to Montreal just to stay at The Ritz Carlton again."
0,"I have been craving burgers lately so I decided to try SmashBurger for the first time. I am definitely not coming back! \n\nThe food presentation seemed legit when the servers brought our food to the table, but their burgers and fries were drenched in grease. Didn't even want to finish my food, and my table was filled with napkins from all that disgusting grease. \n\nService was alright. Janelle took our order & was a tad bit rude. She didn't greet us; but kept interrupting me as I was putting in my order by constantly saying \""for here or to go\"". I obviously couldn't hear her because she made no effort to speak up. Daniel was nice enough to come around our table with a smile, as he was cleaning up & asked how the food was & for us to enjoy the rest of our day."
1,Love Japanese style Italian :) it was good as I expected! Loved Uni pasta even didn't know the price is quiet high (about $29). So I took off 1 star based on a price lol \nWent back with another friend and still enjoyed ;-)

1,"I've been going here since I was a kid.....um a while ago. They are the lease expensive place to go for glasses by far, they take there time with you and their selection is always great.  You sometimes have to wait since they are very popular, but they are popular for great reasons. I don't go anywhere else.....its the very best bang for your buck for something noone wants to have to have."

0,Horrible service! Totally diappointed. I know they probably dont care negative review because so many people come here. I know they are busy but doesn't mean you can ignore cuatomers who wait in line for over 20 mins just try to put the name down. And some people just cut the line and go up to put the name down and totally got ignored by the lady!!!
0,"I only visited the spa and gym because I was actually staying at the Luxor and figured the $15 day pass was really cheap.  Let's just say if I paid anymore, I would have asked for my money back.\n\nFirst, the place is outdated like the other reviews say.  I understand that this hotel has been around for a while but the spa and gym facilities really need a makeover.  \n\nThe gym is worse than a 24 Hour Fitness and the towels smell awful (they didn't even smell like detergent or fabric softener but more of like a chemical smell). \n\nThe lighting in the spa area is awful - think horrible fluorescent ambiance.  The steam room was large and hot but it reminded me of a scene out of gay bath house horror movie - which some people would like I guess.  \n\nThe locker room area looked like a grandmother's kitchen with old wood cabinets.  The vanity area was lacking big time - no lotion, hair products, brushes, combs, etc.  \n\nThere were plenty of non-alcoholic drinks and fruits.\n\nBottom line, if you have time to kill and are a gust of the hotel, $15 is almost worth it."
1,"Do you want to try every flavour of vodka under the sun, while listening to the latest booming R&B beats in a darkened, icy, but oh-so-cool looking environment? Then you've come to the right place.\n\nI always recall getting asked for ID repetitively every time I came to this bar in previous years, while none of my friends ever seemed to get halted at the door, and left to stand rummaging for a provisional driving license in the cold. Now, at the age of 26, I'm still getting ID'd here, but maybe I should just be thankful that someone in the world still thinks I look underage.\n\nAll this is a small price to pay for the wondrous glasses and pitchers of cocktails that are prepared inside, and there are so very many to sample, over 100 in fact, with astonishingly close to 400 vodkas to taste on top of this."
0,"My husband and I really wanted to like this place since it's a Foodfight owned establishment and we love some of their other restaurants. We walked in hoping to sit outside and noticed there were two empty tables in their patio area. We were told it would probably be a 15 minute wait, no problem, so we sat at the bar. \n\nThe bar was steady but not packed - there were even some empty stools. There were two bartenders working and we noticed there were quite a few interesting microbrews on tap we wanted to try. However, we sat at the bar for almost 15 minutes and neither bartender ever even came and talked to us. We walked out.\n\nThere are a LOT of great restaurants in the Madison area, so Craftsman Table & Tap will need to step up their game big time if they want to stick around."
1,"While I definitely understand that a Starbucks drive-thru in the morning is always going to be a little hellish, this place definitely eases that pain and makes it just a wee better when you need a latte in the morning.\n\nThe first time I came here, they messed up my order - frappuccino instead of latte.  What?!  I didn't want to be \""that guy\"" in the drive-thru so I just took it and left.  It was still really, really good... just cold.  In December.  Oh well.\n\nThe second time I came here, they were on point and with a few cars in front of me it was relatively fast.  The drive-thru is kind of unfortunately located as if there is a line you basically have to been in the driving area between shopping complexes.  (Maybe that's why they try to speed through the drive-thru orders?)  Other than that, it's fine.  The employees seem to enjoy their job here unlike other locations I've visited."
0,"My roommate and I have been residents here since January 2014 and our lease ends in November. We're both working college students and one of us is a veteran. We picked this place for convenience, security, and just to make a place a home for our quiet, busy lives.\n\nMove in process was great. It took us two weeks while other apartments usually take a month. They do check your credit score while you do your application. The whole process is done electronically. Our credit score and rental history were fine, which meant no down payments or proof of income for us.\n\nOur unit is one bedroom on the first floor. Rent and water bills may be paid online through the apartment's website. Electricity is through APS. We have cox, but we were not able to get satellite services because buildings/trees block the dish due to where our unit is placed.\n\nManagement here lacks and their priorities are off.\n\nThey are petty with decor or patio furniture regardless if it looks appropriate or if it doesn't bother other residents. We have a nice wooden working table that had a device on it. They told us to remove it. Tools are not allowed in your patios even if they mounted to the table. At one time we had shopping bags of tools set on the working table. The director, Tina, told us to remove it. It was very unnecessary considering they were still in the shopping bags. We literally just placed them there to put in our storage.\n\nAlso, she saw your American flag and told us to take it down. The reason was because she didn't want other residents to be motivated to put other flags/decor up that maybe offensive or inappropriate. Our flag was in code and we had the legal rights to keep our flag up. However, we decided to put it down because we didn't want management harassing us more for petty things. It was just very disappointing for a veteran to be told to put his flag away.\n\nPools are frequently locked on weekends with no given reason. Not good, especially during the summer. Also, the BBQs are in a state of disrepair and are unusable. In addition, parking is chaotic. They don't seem to give you covered parking spots that correspond with your unit. However, there seems to be a handful of uncovered parking. If you don't use your covered spot, neighbors will assume that the spot isn't claimed by any existing resident and will park in your spot.\n\nFirst floor can be a pain because maintenance use leaf blowers and are constantly blowing debris into our patio. This is a gated community, but the gate/gates are FREQUENTLY broken or \""in repair.\"" Although it's not the worse neighborhood in Phoenix, but it's far from the best. Therefore, the gates are a concern to us and we are paying an extra $100 compared to non-gated communities surrounding the area. Maintenance is not on top of things. The light in our breezeway have been out for weeks.\n\nOther then that, Paradise Falls is affordable, the application process is efficient, and it is a \""gated\"" community, there's security here as well."
1,"Five Guys FTW!!  This place is pretty amaaaa-ZING! \n\nWe usually get the bacon cheeseburger (I order the \""little\"" since two patties on the \""regular\"" would be too much for me).  I love the FREE toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions.  I always  order mine with extra mushrooms as I am a mushroom feign.  They also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that.  Their bacon cheese dog is also delicious.  I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  \n\nTheir cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).  \n\nThis place does not fail to disappoint and has grown to be our go-to place for burgers."

The only exception is the people behind the counter. \nMy experience with Lorraine (sp) was a fast, friendly and no stress experience.

0,"My wife and I ate here last night and were enthusiastic upon entering the restaurant after hearing and reading all the hype about this chain.  But, what a major disappointment.  \n\nWe ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Grimaldi's is very proud of their pies with a $16.00 sticker price on a basic large cheese.  Toppings are $2.00 each.  So with $20.00 invested in the pie we were hoping for a really good taste.  \n\nWe like our pizza a little extra crispy and ordered it that way but it came out chewy like a piece of jerky.  Upon inspection - I pulled the cheese and topping layer off the crust - we saw a gummy crust that looked like a glazed donut. A total turn-off.  \n\nAlso, the sauce was tasteless and the cook skimped on the toppings.  I've eaten a gazillion pizzas in my day and this pie gets a letter grade of an F.  \n\nFor starters we tried the house salad and at best, it was very average.  The ingredients weren't chopped/prepared professionally and the dressing was bland.  \n\nWe mentioned our disappointment to our waitress and she had the manager come over to speak to us.  We pointed out the gummy undone crust and he took 50% off the pizza and said he hoped we'd give his store another try.  But nothing turns me off more than unjustified hype, and Grimaldi's gets way too much credit for basically no reason.  \n\nI think I'll stick with Oregano's....or heck, even Peter Piper has way better pizza."
1,"The best pizza in Gaston County... again. You'll quickly find out why with a slice. I'm not much of a fan of some of their sandwiches. I have had better. However, for pizza, look no further. I know that whenever someone who doesn't typically eat pizza or even request to get pizza asks to specifically come here, that has to tell you something. Coke products, some NY style soda and some Italian beer can be purchased. Mr. Simonetti can often be found working the oven himself. The staff is amazing.\n\nLocated off of the Belmont Abbey exit of i-85 at Wilkinson - found in the shopping plaza behind McDonalds."
1,"First trip to Montreal, first time tasting poutine, smoked meat, beaver tail pastry (queues de castor), and sugar pie.\nMy sister & I split a bacon poutine and really loved it, though it nearly put us in a salt coma.  We were also tempted by the one with guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes.\nIt's a crowded, fun place with many visitors snapping photos of their poutines."
1,"Nothing in Vegas is free. However a trip here gives you a free look into part of The Count's personal collection. The showroom was great. Being able to see his personal collection up close is amazing. Walking through those front doors was unimaginable. Did not get a chance to see anyone from the show inside the building. As I walked around, the only downfall to the experience was the setup. A lot of the cars are bunched together so you don't get a great look at his entire collection. But still awesome to see what you can. I was lucky enough to see Roli out in the parking lot as I was leaving and took a picture with him. Did not expect to see him driving a Mercedes. Overall though, definitely a must go."
1,"This is another work lunch takeout place for me and it always does me right. I always get the Jerk Chicken bowl with rumbi rice and have never been disappointed by it. Good flavor, lots of chicken and veggies and rumbi rice is simply delicious. I personally like to add hot sauce and also sometimes splurge on a cup of tortilla soup -which is pretty freakin great. There's alot of cheese on top of the soup so lactose intolerants beware!"

0,"Just isn't very good.\n\nI don't understand why people give this place even three stars.  It's rare for me to give a place a low rating, but, My Big Fat Greek restaurant is nothing but gimmick anymore and has gone from bad to worse.   The food is not even close to any representation of what good Greek food tastes like.\n\nI've been to this place several times over the years.  This location and others.   It used to be just on the lower end of OK...  it's never been as good as you can get from a 'Ma and 'Pa place.  However, we went for lunch the other day and it's just gotten to the point I wouldn't even go back for a quick bite.\n\nWe ordered the garlic hummus, and it was overly full of garlic and not home made.  It seemed to be loaded with garlic powder, as opposed to fresh hummus that just had roasted garlic in it.   The olives we ordered were rough at best.  UGH even thinking about them.  Overly seasoned and not very fresh.   The rice was over cooked and was so soft it lacked any sort of texture.\n\nThe first rule of good let, alone great food, is FRESH.   This place needs a rescue.\n\nLess critical, but, I think an overall representation of what has happened to the place, the menu's were totally trashed.   As in ratty, tattered, and dirty.  The lamination was coming off them and they were dirty. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
1,"I love the Bellagio Fine Art Gallery!\n\nSince this gallery changes the \""theme\"" if you will bi-yearly, every time you come to Vegas there will likely be a different exhibit. \n\nAlso, this gallery is not an all-day, museum-like gallery.  There will be around 20 paintings/sculptures, and that's that.  Likely you will be able to experience the entire exhibit in an hour or less.\n\nAll of the exhibits are set to audio, and the audio is included in the ticket price.  The tickets are $15 ($10 for students/residents/seniors) and worth every penny.  Let's think about it....$15 can't even by you a margarita-by-the-yard.  But it WILL by you an hour of art, culture, and history."
1,$3.95 NY steak and eggs with hash browns! from 12am - 6am only\nIt was a good steak for the price... sooo cheap! \nThe mozarella sticks are kinda pricey and the red clam chowder was sour.\n\nTHIS PLACE IS WORTH A TRY FOR THE $3.95 STEAK! \nDEFINITELY WILL GO BACK TO TAKE MY PARENTS.
0,We love the Vig. Been their many times. We ordered take out this evening. Pad Thai. My friend was enjoying his meal and bit into a piece of wire that was in his pad Thai. Luckily he didn't cut or slice his mouth or swallow it but it was shocking this was in his food. I was not happy. Never had that happen before.

Make sure you reserve ahead of time so you don't have to deal with the wait and the lines.  \n\nI'm going to be brutal on this one fellas...\n\nIf you have any inclinations about being cheap, this is not the place for you.  If you're in Vegas, then act accordingly.  Don't go to Tryst if you're on a budget go to LAX or JET, you'll probably have a better time.  But if you're at Tryst, then spend that gwap.  It's the only way to ensure a smooth transaction.\n\nAnother reason for VIP is so that you an avoid the massive amount of bodies on the regular floor.  \n\nOk, I'll put things in perspective for you fella.  Last time I was there, I sat between A-Rod and Busta Rhymes.  Total bill was $1800, split between 5 guys.  The $1800 also ensured an afterparty at an un-named venue where fatalities occurred on a half-hourly basis.\n\nDon't be cheap..."

If that were true, they would've mentioned it when I dropped off the car and gave them the coupon.  \n\nThe fact is they just didn't want to honor their coupon.  The coupon was just to get customers in the door.  This place RIPS YOU OFF.  Stay away."

1,"First time dining at Binkley's and it was virtually perfect.  Environment is comfortable, attractive, and unobtrusive.  Same with service- warm and available yet never over-bearing.  The food was completely terrific- really creative and memorable--- every single dish was good though halibut in parchment stood out especially.  I love Kai and Elements and would hurry to go back there for the great service and gorgeous setting, but, in terms of the sheer quality of the food, Binkley's is the best restaurant in Phoenix.  I am only sorry that it is SO expensive ($110. per person with only 2 glasses of wine for 1 of us) that we won't be able to dine here more frequently.  Outstanding.  Do not hesitate to go to Binkley's."
1,We have been going to Dr. Park for years.  He and his staff have been great.\n\n Then out of nowhere we get a letter dated 10/13/14 stating he is closing effective 10/17/14.  We received this letter on 10/17/14.\n\nI was no too happy about the lack of notice from him.  I had call on that Monday to get a refill of medication for my cat and no one even mentioned this.  They told me it would be a couple of days before I could pick it up.  Then on that Friday I get the notice in the mail.  I ended up having to go to another vet and paying much more for the medication.  Very unprofessional way to end his business.

0,"As soon as we entered, we were greeted as the norm and were seated.  We got water and were given the menu.  We asked for the specialty of the house, but no suggestions were given.   We asked for the food to be spicy, but were disappointed three times.  Overall, the quantity of the food is less than what you pay for and there is a communication gap as you are not served the food the way that you like.  When we tried to explain that the food was not spicy enough, nothing was done!  We had to pay out of our pocket for ordering another dish of the same vegetable, but spice, not bland.  We spent close to $100.00 and were sadly disappointed as the food was land, with no taste, poor service with jacked up prices."
1,"Arranged for a \""small\"" group of 22+ to meet for happy hour and great acoustic music.  Not only did they graciously accommodate the group, but the waitress, Erin, was able to give separate checks and constantly checked to see if everything was good, and made sure that everyone was taken care of well.  The food was great! Something so simple as sliders were made to taste amazing with sauteed onions and pickles.  The beer sampler was a huge hit and enjoyed by many in the group.  This place knows how to make sure everyone leaves happy.  The whole group was pleased and can't wait to go back.  Thank you, thank you, thank you,"
0,What a poorly managed event. \n\nParking was horrendous and took 45 minutes to weave our way through the pre orchestrated maze.\n\nThen you got to stand in line for your over priced tickets which were $12. Then you got to stand in line for security check. Another line for wristbands to drink. Another line for tokens to buy over priced 8 oz glasses of beer for $6. And finally ridiculous long lines for the food vendors.\n\nThere was little shade provided and I am appalled at how expensive everything was. We spent easily over $100 for the afternoon. \n\nI felt like we were hearded like cattle.  I won't do this again even if the tickets were free.
0,"good things:\ncenter of the strip\ngood price\nmiracle mile shops downstairs\nelevators close to rooms \nbathrooms have closed in wc, so getting ready is easy\n\nBad things\nroom view was to a rooftop\nbed okay\nlots of sells people for the westgate, the club, and restuarant, and they are AGGRESSIVE\nThey made my friends wait 5 hours for a room and refused to take the bags upstairs because they didn't want to feel responsible \nNone the the staff will give you the same information, we were told we could have a late check out for free, they wanted to charge our friends 50 dollars\nA manager is NEVER ON DUTY.  whenever you call to complain they tell you the manager is unavailable...\n\n\nall in all, we had a better stay at the flamingo.. sure its a little older but at least they were more professional!!"
1,"I ordered four tapas & seafood paella. Other two friends and I shared all of them. The tapas were all fabulous, especially black rice which is with squid ink. The other three are salmon & truffle, octopus, and lobster & saffron. But seafood paella did not reach my expectation, cuz I did like the rice inside, however the prawn really nice!"
0,Great variety and reasonable prices but the customer service leaves something to be desired. I'm never greeted when entering the store and its rare that the sales staff will ask if I need anything. I would shop there more if they had better service.
0,"Internet wasn't working so I went to relax by the pool.   They are jack hammering something so it isn't very relaxing, oh well   This place is huge and empty so I don't know why they are boarding people near a construction project.  \n\nPositives - nice looking resort with nice staff"

0,"As I walked in, I was reading some bad reviews on my blackberry.  But the joint was jumping, there were good-looking pople all around, and I had a good recommendation.  So I took a seat next to the flaming fountain on the patio, and absorbed the cool atmosphere.\n\nI wasn't jazzed about the menu descriptions.  They all sounded dull:  grilled sea bass topped with shrimp over garlic mashed potatoes;  Grilled salmon with an apple glaze; various enchiladas; chicken with penne pasta.  I decided that a place called the tortilla factory has got to have good tacos, so I ordered the house tacos.  How could I go wrong?\n\nI ordered chips and salsa, and the waiter brought some complimentary black bean tortillas with tomato butter.  I wolfed down one thick, leaden, undercooked flour tortilla and pushed the plate away.  Maybe the worst tortilla I've ever had!\n\nThe house tacos were just like the fajitas from any chain restaurant:  grilled chicken, steak, and shrimp with accompaniments: guacamole, beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  Shredded iceberg lettuce was the only vegetable.\n\nEach individual item was quite bland.  It all could have used a squirt of lime juice, some cilantro, or even just salt and pepper.  The gilled chicken was as tough as could be.  And the plain flour tortillas were nothing special.   I picked at the steak and shrimp and left the chicken.\n\nThen I made a huge blunder and ate a second black bean burrito.  As I write this review, I can feel this baseball-sized lump of dough in my stomach.   \n\nThe atmosphere is cool, but the food stinks.  It reminded me of cafeteria food:  bland, overcooked, and not really fresh."
1,"My brother and I used to frequent this place often when he lived in town. They have the most amazing desserts I've ever tasted. The menu changes depending on the season but it is superb. The atmosphere is very hip and modern. The service is great. Best of all, Chef Kerry Simon is very involved and is a very kind and humble guy. Love this place. Will be going back soon!"
0,"Terrible. My fianc\u00e9 ordered flowers for me for my birthday (he phoned them and asked them to put together a package of flowers and something else). At 2pm, the delivery man called me to tell me to expect him in the next 15 minutes and to ask me how to get to my building. I just moved here! Your guess is as good as mine, sir. After I Googled it and gave the driver directions, I waited. I waited until 245pm, when I got tired of waiting to leave the house and decided to see what was going on. To the driver's credit, he did answer the phone and told me he had a flat tire and would be 30 minutes more. At about 315pm, and ANOTHER phone call confirming my building's location, he showed up. He was very smiley and nice...until he called me 10 minutes after leaving, informed me that he had given me the box of chocolates by mistake, and that he would be coming back to get them. I was like \""Uh, no.\"" Called the fianc\u00e9 since I wasn't sure exactly what was supposed to have been delivered, and he called the driver back. The driver complained that he'd have to pay for the chocolates himself but agreed to let it go. My question is: what does this florist think constitutes flowers and something else if the chocolates weren't that something else? What kind of company thinks it's acceptable to drive back to my home to take away a box of chocolates (let's face it, they're not irreplaceable) that they delivered by mistake? I once worked a retail job and accidentally put an item in a customer's bag that I hadn't scanned and she left without paying for it. I 'fessed up and paid for it myself, because it was MY fault. \n\nAnd, to top it off, I sent the fianc\u00e9 a photo of the flowers, and they aren't what he asked for. I think they're pretty, at least."
0,"I've been to this store several times - in the past - and have tried the cheese, garlic, plain and combo bagels.  This location is packed in the mornings with regulars:  cops, locals, many of the people from my neightborhood, including a columnist from the Arizona Republic.   I don't like their bagels.  They're small, bland, and too dense.  My favorite bagels are Costco's cheese bagels.  Second runner up are Fry's cheese bagels."
0,"Beware.. Dont let this establishment fool you.. It seems like your getting a good deal, but actually your not.. The quality of fish is very bad. Dont waste your money and get sick to pay more for your doctor bill.. Sushi mon is the real deal.."
1,"Sometimes months will go by and I forget about Rubios. Then I'll have it and I'm reminded how good it is!\n\nThe salsa bar rocks. Chips are free with every meal. Prices are reasonable. Oh, and they have some healthy options as well (the HealthMex tacos/burritos are really yummy!).\n\nMy husband LOVES their fish tacos--the original AND the grilled versions as well."
1,"This is a wonderful place to come for brunch on a weekend or just for breakfast when you are lazy and want to eat something nice, like eggs with bacon and toast. The staff is very polite and friendly and the food is great. I have noticed that the waitresses, almost every single one has a big rear end, and they wear really tight dresses or skirts, I don't know if this is on purpose ( as a part of the place ambiance) or just a coincidence."
1,"One of my favorite frozen yogurt places. Much like Yogurtland, U-swirl offers build it yourself froyo at a price per ounce. While I prefer the froyo from Yogurtland, the toppings at U-swirl are much more diverse and often times better. During this most recent outing, I was able to get Passionfruit Pearls for my ice cream which added a wonderful burst of flavor. Either place is a great choice for a treat!"
0,"So we thought we were coming here for a fun AZ wedding... This place is a joke! The customer service is horrific. In fact, there is no service. If you have a request... SOL! No way they will accommodate your needs what-so-ever. It is not in their vocabulary. Seriously, does not compute. The golf course is fair at best and the accommodations are non existent. If you're thinking about staying here, think again!! You've been warned. Stay anywhere else but here! Stay at a holiday inn, best western or whatever! Do not stay here! This place is awful. No stars!!!! Ok I had to put one star for the review. Not true though. NO STARS!!!!!! Worst place EVER!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Andrew's was ok at best. The BBQ sauce they put on everything is lacking to say the least. I got the sampler and I didn't enjoy anything too much. My girlfriend said the Mac and cheese was good.
0,"Looking for decent asian food around midnight on the strip.made the mistake of going to this place.\n\nFood was average.price ok.\n\nThe practices of the owner (a lady in casual clothes) and the server (lady named hyo won,i think.not sure) was not exactly as clean as i expected it to be. Started with the server dropping cutlery on a table in the back which was directly visible to our table. She picked it up and put in back with the other clean ones.ugh.i was willing to let that slide,given the table supposedly is clean. \n\n2.as the owner and server was cleaning up the table beside us,clearing plates and all the owner wiped the table with a wet white cloth and didnt wipe it dry. I didnt see her or the server wash their hands either because when the owner put the wet cloth away,she was out right away which means she didnt have time to wash. Server too.out of the back right away.no qiping hands or anything.ughhh.\n\nConsidering it was 1140 at ngit they were super understaffed but surprisingly food didnt take too long to come out. Decent waiting time.\n\nLastly.the worst experience.and a complete no-no for owners to do to restaurants--- \n\nI paid with my card..automatically noticed that there was no service charge included. Didnt want to charge the tip on the card and wanted to leave cash on the table for tip instead.but what did the rude owner do?? Said out loud in a really loud voice in front of other restaurant patrons \""EXCUSE ME! EXCUSE ME! YOU DID NOT LEAVE A TIP! SERVICE CHARGE IS NOT INCLUDED HERE!\""\n\nthe nerve! I told her we were gonna lrave cash for the tip.which we already had on the table.\n\nTO THE OWNER::DO NOT EMBARRASS PATRONS LIKE THAT.HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF CHAGED BILL WITH CASH LEFT FOR TIP. IN THE FIRST PLACE,IF YOUR SERVICE IS GOOD YOU SHOULDNT BE WORRIED IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA LEAVE TIPS OR NOT. BUT I GUESS SINCE IT IS NOT GOOD-AS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED,THEN YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED. YOU DID NOT EVEN DESERVE TO BE TIPPED.\n\nit was a mistake to give this place a chance despite all the negative reviews.NOT WORTH IT.initially i thought the revieqs were just because the pips who did reviews were drunk but apparently,drunk or not YOU KNOW BAD SERVICE (FROM THE OWNER) WHEN YOU GET IT."
1,"Always satisfied when I walk out! I'm a barber so it feels nice to be on the chair and trust me when I say, they know what they're doing!"
1,"Came back after NYE. I got Steak Frites, the girls got Pork Cheek and Roasted Chicken. All were really delicious. I like some burns in my food so my steak (medium but a bit toward rare) had some burn on the outside is yummy to me. The Pork Cheek, however, was amazing. It literally melt in your mouth!\nAnd yes, had to get the beignets!!!"
1,"I enjoyed this intimate little spot. I had a drink names \""Gods Gift\"" and it was delish! The atmosphere is wonderful and I can see myself going here with friends just to chill out and enjoy some laughs. The drinks are affordable for what you get! I've had crappier drinks that were twice as much."
1,One of the best pizza delivery restaurants in the Saint-Laurent area.
1,Kick ass breakfast place.  Friendly efficeint staff serve up tasty fresh food!
1,"We have been there at least 5 times now and I'm a huge fan!!! LOVE the table-side Guacamole, bean dip, chips, and salsa's to start.  We have tried the carne asada taquitos, the enchiladas, the Carne Asada, the beef taco's and chicken chimichanga.  They were all tasty!\n\nThe beans and rice are standard.  Love their fideo soup.  Service has always been very good. Prices comparable to the other Mexican restaurants in town."
0,I had to download the yelp app to my new phone just to explain how horrible this food was. If you pay $7 for a bowl of essentially 'chicken noodle soup' it really should not be a bowl scantily filled with tenden laden crunchy lumps of dark chicken 'meat' and floating pieces of nasty looking chicken skins. There was other random bits oily nasty broth and even though I was told they were going to call my number when ready I had to get tapped by another customer asking me if that was my food sitting on the counter. (hint it was)
0,Club is a great place to pick up an old lady or sugar daddy for a few hours. Bathrooms are the only nice thing about this place.
0,They've changed the menu..Again! I guess the service is friendly but god help you if you show up when its busy. I won't be back.
0,"Everything I've had there I've had better elsewhere. $7 falafel plate is too pricey (cheap ingredients, in Egypt this plate would cost you only $0.75 based on my personal experience). Dolmades or grape leaves dish was so-so. Finally, gyros isn't fresh off the spit as it should be for the best taste and quality. Based on taste and the identical cuts of each strip of gyros (only 4 measly slices for a $13 plate), I was able to tell the gyros was prepackaged and most likely frozen. Everything was edible at least, but far from what it could be and every item is overpriced due to the size and/or quality. I've got another Greek place in Phoenix area that serves much better Greek/Mediterranean food I'll go to instead."
1,"Pop culture heaven in useful items like clothes, wallets, phone cases, jewelry, music, fragrances and more for both males & females. Always love the variety. Pricey, but they usually run sales so you rarely have to pay full prices."
1,"Went late night and was the only table in the place, good service the duck was very good tender with crispy skin and also pan friend noodles with beef were good too. Would go back again."
1,"Oh I love this place. Their pizzas are square/rectangle! A single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. It is in the strangest location (Home Depot's parking lot)!! The picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. Love this place!"
0,Location is awesome for people watching if you sit along the elevated glass railing overlooking the strip. My wife and I sat outside but near the inside of the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food but the location was amazing. The food was just ok I thought by the restaurant sitting on the sidewalk on the strip in front of the Miracle Mall I expected more. I did like the mist sprays to cool the air.
0,"Great sushi. I am a fan of the happy hour and the amount of sushi that gets brought to the table. My favorite roll has to be the atomic roll and the phoenix roll. Very tasty. I would give this place more stars if they had a better idea of proper service. Most of the staff doesn't seem to know the product- beside the amazing sushi chefs. Every waitress I have encountered looks like a deer in headlights when I have asked questions about the products. Not to mention, they do no buss their tables. I sat with six dirty plates on my table while eating my dessert. Usually when I walk in there are dirty tables left untouched for quite some time. I even commented to my friend that if given the opportunity I would train the staff myself about proper service and etiquette. I have faith that this place could be a five star joint, if only they would improve on the simpler things. Good luck Sushiya."
1,"The angry dog is insanely delicious. The best dog I have EVER had. Fries solid, dipped in their ho-made smokey, spicy mayo really brings them alive, and I am usually not a mayo and fry guy...nor a \""frysauce\"" guy. Everything is pretty much made on the spot and the sample of the bean-less chili also made quite an impression. After all this, why am I still angry? Because they are not downtown! Though a little doggie told me that may be changing soon. Friendly staff, creativity in the kitchen, clean digs,,,yea,  just go and woof one down. Get a couple of extra napkins...you'll need em'. Update: upon second visit, I had the Euro Special Fries...Also a taste sensation topped with pork belly bacon, fresh herbs, cheddar, and garlic mayo."
0,It was just ok. Not sure what people expect in az but it was nothing special. The pulled pork was too runny and spicy. The mac and cheese was from a box. Tell me their is better bbq in phoenix than this??????
0,"We decided to try this for breakfast after getting our Christmas pictures done.  Big mistake.  It took awhile to be seated even though there were a lot of tables available.  We got drinks pretty quickly but refills on the coffee were non existant even after I placed both cup on the end of our table.  My husband ordered a ham and cheese omelette and asked for the hash brown w/out onions, I ordered the spanish omelette and asked for the onion to be cooked or left out.  It took forever to get our food and when it arrived my husbands hash browns were cold and loaded with onions.  Mine the onions were raw.  My daughter had a bagel and fruit that was fine but how can you mess that up.  On top of everything it was a litle on the pricey side.  We will NEVER go back again!"
1,"I am stunned that no one has reviewed this place! Every time I am in LV, it is a must-stop at least twice! They have the best pizza EVER! And I am from NY, so clearly I've ingested a few slices! Having said that, they do have other options; calzones, lasagna, panini. It's just a tiny place in the Venetian Food Court, but well worth the stop and it's very inexpensive. Great place to get a couple slices on the way back up to your room and enjoy in bed - helps keep those bad mornings away, hahaha!"
0,"Ordered from them at 6:04 p.m. for delivery...at 6:52 p.m. no food...called the store to find out where our orer was and was rudely told, \""I don't know, it's not here, so it must be on it's way\""...7:23 p.m. no food...called to cancel order, and while on the phone with them the delivery guy shows up...I agree to pay, but no tip...get our food, and start going throug the bag and noticed some extra items...fried wontons and spring rolls...maybe free because they were late?...nope...there was a knock on the door...delivery guy gave us the wrong bag...got our food finally and it sucked...worst lo mein ever...will never order from Chen Wok again...oh, and sorry to the people who's food I fingered for them..."
0,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!\n\nThis store offered to ship my WINE and since it is delicate and we know how bad UPS drivers toss around boxes, I paid for the insurance. A bottle broke so my wine got sent back to me. When I went to pick it up, I found 10 of my 12 bottles sitting in the bottom of a box. I offered to re-wrap the bottles so they would arrive safely. The store manager denied the re-shipping of my package. She said, \""IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHIP WINE.\"" hmm what is wrong with this statement? Its called BAD BUSINESS.\n\nWhy did they ship it in the first place? Take my money and run huh. No reimbursement, no apology, I still have the wine and it needs to get to another location. I called corporate and was promised that my problem would be resolved within 48 hours of my complaint. It's a week later and no resolution, no phone call, and now the lady at corporate is ignoring my messages. Just give me my money back and I'll take my business elsewhere....FOREVER!\n\nThere are many many more details and problems with this story, but I was trying to keep it simple. DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS!!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE, FULL OF LIES, and THEY TREAT YOUR STUFF LIKE CRAP AND STEAL FROM YOU!!!!"
1,"Okay, I thought Pop's was great! Heard of all the hype and it was worth it! I ordered a steak philly with onions and extra whiz. I thought it was great! Good service and quick delivery!

0,"So it's late at night, you've been drinking in a town that never stops pouring. In the final round, you decide to take on some local culture at a nearby dive bar where you realize that the $4.99 breakfast buffet really doesn't hold up it's own. Stomach grumbling, you find yourself stumbling around in a \""not-so-good\"" neighborhood searching for something to curb the battle going on inside your empty insides. The bartender pointed you in the direction down Twain Ave where, like a beacon of salvation, your quest for greasy food is at an end.\n\nVictor's Taco Shop is about as \""authentic\"" as you get. Upon entry, you're blasted with warm air. The temperature in this place is even hotter than it is outside! That explains the extremely sweaty cooks behind the counter who are all but unaware of your arrival. The sound of Mariachi music is blaring from behind the counter and your only relief from the sweltering heat is a power fan blowing in the direction towards the counter itself.  \n\nYou order a plate of 5 Rolled Tacos  with everything on it and the counter cook looks at you like you're speaking a foreign language. He repeats the order, but shorter and asking (in broken English) how many you want. You tell him that you want 5 Rolled Tacos, he looks at you again like he doesn't understand. He asks if you want 5 orders of rolled tacos. You correct him and say you only want 5 of them. He responds with a completely off base response asking if you want an Number 5.\n\nAgain you correct him, now pointing to the picture on the menu with the 5 Rolled Tacos. He gets it now and you clarify that you wanted the sour cream and guacamole on it as well. The cook confirms and they get to work on your order. After what seems like an eternity standing there waiting for your order you contemplate playing one of the video games sitting along the wall. The screen is faded and you decide to pass.\n\nMeanwhile, a young Hispanic man enters the Taco Shop. His pupils are heavily dilated and he's giving off nervous energy. He places his order in Spanish, pays for the meal, and moments later. The burrito is in his hands and he's out the door. You notice that your rolled tacos are sitting on the ledge under the heat lamps.\n\nThe counter cook notices that you noticed as well and hands them to you with a malicious smile. He got one on the gringo. Realizing that you don't have anything to wash the tacos down with, you purchase a bottle of Coca-Cola for $2.25. Peeling back the aluminum foil on your rolled tacos, you are greeted by the food slapped together poorly. The guacamole and sour cream are runny.  Defeated, hungry, and now your buzz is gone you finish your rolled tacos. You exit the restaurant only to realize that there's a Roberto's in the same strip mall.\n\nMy $.02 Cents:\n2 Stars - Poor food quality,  hot and gross dining facility, poor service. My suggestion is to head to Roberto's right behind them. You get more for you money and don't need to speak Spanish to get good service."

Then a guy came over and scraped a little more out of the pot, charged me $5.32 and gave it to me.\nI ate the hamburger while reading some lit up sign exclaiming that FRESH IS BEST. Then took a spoon of chili and spit it out. I told the girl of the problem and she said she has more chili on the stove and did I want some. No way and I left. I called the number on the receipt to complain and some guy did not want to talk and told me to call the 800 # on the receipt. I told him there was no #. I told him--I will handle this a different way and here it is--I AM A YELPER!\nI told my wife about it and when I mentioned the location, she told me she hates that place and does not go there.

1,"I'm from Hawaii, where eating Japanese cuisine is part of my everyday. Truthfully, I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant while on a vacation, but the boyfriend wanted to...and I owed him for so willingly accompanying me to the Celine Dion concert. \n\nHyakumi was an unexpected delight. We easily made reservations in the morning and ate dinner at around 6.  \n\nThe service was attentive but it was the food that left me satisfied. We split a hibachi order with sushi on the side. The meat was flavored simply and was very tender - though overcooked for our order of medium rare. I hate meat that is flavored so much that you can't taste that you are eating beef.\n\nThe sushi was among the best I've ever had. The ahi (tuna) went down so smoothly that I had to eat several more pieces to confirm that I was eating such heavenly food. \n\nOverall, I'd go again."
0,"My review is NOT about Home Depot so much as the Hampton Bay products that they carry.  I bought a 4 light bathroom fixture and of course while putting it up broke one of the globes.  Went to get another globe and guess what?  They don't carry them.  Went to all the stores in Las Vegas except one and got the same thing.  Given a Hampton Bay website and phone # and was told on the phone that even they couldn't get replacements from CHINA!  Well, needless to say, I'm out $59.95 for the fixture and have to purchase another one.\nDO NOT BUY HAMPTON BAY LIGHTING!  \nCharles Abinante"
0,"Ugh.  I was really expecting something better.  We stopped by for lunch around 1pm on a Monday and service was very slow.  The gentleman that helped us was quite friendly and obviously busy keeping the place clean (and it was very clean), but we even had to wait more than 10 minutes just for the menus, then another 20 for our food.\nWe ordered the twice-cooked pork, salt & pepper chicken wing appetizer, Mongolian beef, and I had a lychee slush with boba added.\nThough the menu said there was a choice of soup with the pork lunch special, we were brought the bean curd and seaweed.  The broth had been thickened with too much starch and had very little flavor besides salt.  The pork dish came out before I had even had a second spoonful of the soup, so I asked about the chicken wings.  I was told they don't serve appetizers first like they do in American restaurants.  Hmmm, really?  \nA minute later we received the Mongolian beef, with the chicken wings right behind.  \nI really wouldn't have minded this if the food was good.  It did all seem quite fresh, but the only thing I liked was my refreshing slush.  I had not realized when I ordered it that the twice cooked pork was actually pork belly.  Perhaps this was my fault, but neither my guest or I liked it.  The sauce was rather good, but the fat was too tough to bite through.\nThe Mongolian Beef, a dish I have had many versions of, was the worst iteration yet.  There was a lot of onion that had barely touched the wok, it was so raw and the sauce was quite sweet and thick as though it came straight out of a bottle.  This was served with some fried rice that had an unpleasant flavor.\nThe wings were not bad,  the coating was crispy and fried just right.  I didn't love the flavoring, which had a bit too much 5-spice for me, but at least I could eat my share of these.  The other two dishes that we shared, were not even halfway eaten by the time we ready to leave."
0,"You know that look you get from a waitress when you order something off of the menu that they think might be questionable? Well, I got that look tonight. I met my sister on the patio around 5:30. The patio is small but nice if it's not too busy. Stephanie was our waitress and she was very sweet, she had a great personality and I would definitely give her more like four out five stars but the food not so much. They do have a good happy hour on Monday and Tuesday nights from 2pm to 8pm so I will give them that. The app selection on the happy hour menu is quite slim however. We did decided to get the pretzels with cheese, the cheese is $2 extra which I honestly think is kind of ridiculous because pretzels and cheese should be a given. They were not bad, not great but honestly I could get a pretzel that is a million times better and much bigger a few feet down the way at a particular brewing co...\n\nOn to the entrees. My sister had asked before I had arrived what the waitress suggested off of the menu. She suggested the fish and chips hands down. I should have also heeded this advice but I was kind of craving a burger so I decided to take a chance and order one. I should have known right away that it would not be what I wanted when Stephanie told me that they did not have american cheese. I am an american cheese burger type of girl, cheddar just doesn't cut it for me. The look on our waitress's face when I ordered the burger was one of disdain. I know that she did not purposely mean to make the face but she did. I honestly wish she would have told me not to order it. It was not good, it was very bad in fact. Dry, tasteless, overcooked meat with a semi hard bun. I should have sent it back but I instead decided to suffer through half of it which is retrospect and a stomach ache later, was a bad idea. I did eat most of the sweet potato fries that came with the burger with the $2 cheese sauce that was left over from the pretzel. It didn't make up for the disappointing burger. My sister did enjoy her fish and chips and the tarter sauce did look good as well.\n\nOverall I have come to the conclusion that this is a restaurant/pub that is very hit or miss when it comes to food. If you want to come here to drink and have an appetizer or two you might enjoy your visit more. If you come here to eat dinner, by all means do not get a burger and I would also suggest to avoid the sliders. Honestly, you can find a much better meal a few steps down the sidewalk. Most likely will not return. Stephanie, you did your best with the hand you were given."

0,"Excellent chicken that I like more than some of the other quick service tex-mex places; HOWEVER, the quesadilla comes with no extras. Salsa is 99 cents, quac us 99 cents.  I can understand the quac, although the portion size is a partially filled 2 oz container, but to pay for salsa??  The quac does not compare to chipotle. And I wouldn't pay for it again.  The rice and beans are decent, but I would gladly give them up for some salsa!"
0,"I was very disappointed when I made a special trip to this restaurant.  For months I have listened to the wonderful commercials on the radio.  Could not wait to try.  The few times I was going to be in the area was always a Sunday, when they are closed. That is why it took me so long to go there.  \n\nWhen I finally had the opportunity the food was just okay and the server was unwilling to recommend.  He actually asked me how he would know what item I would prefer.  \n\nI had expected a wonderfully cheerful, friendly experience, based on the commercial.  I believe the owner or manager was there and visiting with another table with the kind of experience I anticipated, we however did not even get a hello.    Luckily, I had a friend in from out of town.  \n\nUnfortunately, I was unimpressed."
1,"So it comes to this! I am writing a review on a fast food joint. Why would I do that? Imma tell you! DORITO SHELLS!!!!! That's why!\n\nOnce up on a time, I was a pretty big fan of the Bell. Pretty good grub for a pittance. But as the years went by the beef filling got thinner and thinner and the lettuce started taking up it's place. I was there for a beef taco, not a lettuce taco with beef flavoring.  \n\nBut NOW they've gone and done it. Take the traditional shell and turn it into a Dorito chip. STFU!!!!!!! I would like to kiss, square on the lips, whoever came up with this idea (yep, even a guy, don't mind smooching a man for an idea this good!).  Seriously, I would cover the medical bills if this person broke their arm patting themselves on the back.\n\nAs a bonus for this visit, there was a fellow named George who was doing pretty much the entire front side of the business. At one time he was ringing my order up on one register while finishing payment for another customer on another! It was like watching a yo-yo-er yo-yo-ing with both hands. Kudos' to George, you deserve a raise.\n\n\""Why then, Vic, are you only giving 4 out of 5 star's, when you obviously enjoyed your visit\"", you may ask.(and you may)\n\nThree words: Not Enough Beef!"
1,"I am basically a regular here.  Not only have I had may hair and make up done by them mnay times but they treated my girls to mani-pedi for their bday!  This place is great, the management is amazing and the staff if incredible.  Monet is a pleasure Jenesssa (Sp?) is one of my favorites.  Highly recommended."
1,Ome of my all time fav spots!! For some reason this thing is not lettong me add pictures...but that wo t stop me. So to start we ordered the southwest egg rolls which were amazing with the guac ranch dip. For my entree I had the Trio fajiyas(chicken steak amd shrimp) since i couldnt decide which one.. the combo of veggirs and sauce was great. For dessert chocolate melted cake. NEED I SAY MORE! they also have these cool tablets on each table in which u can reorder drinks or food...you can also play games and pay your check!!
0,"Was excited to eat here, ordered 3 tacos al pastor with traditional trimmings -- onion, cilantro, hot sauce. Very disappointed to have super-dry meat. Maybe it was because I arrived at 5:30pm and it wasn't busy, but had been hoping for something at least as good as a taco truck."
0,"Front desk took FOREVER to check me in even though I already had purchased my reservation online. Then, each additional person (even visitors) had to pay a fee ($28) just to go to the room! You have to wear a wristband to get to your room as well, if you lose it, that's another $28. You also cannot visit other people staying in the same hotel if they have a different wristband! This was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard of. To top it all off the room was well below average. I urge you to do yourself a favor and pay an extra $10-$20 and stay somewhere better! I upgraded to the stratosphere for $15 extra a night and WOW what a difference!"
1,"Pizzeria Bianco is definitely one of the premier pizza place in Arizona. I've been there a few times now, and I would say it's worth it every time! I have a friend who goes there frequently for her birthday, and I'm happy to tag along!"
0,"Not impressed, especially given the reputation that it's a great place. It started with not being able to sit in the main room and we got taken down a long hall in a secluded room full of booths, with a loud fan and a dark, lonesome, secluded setting. The space between the table and bench is quite large so makes it awkward being so far from your food. The spicy cheese bread was about the only thing that gets a 3/4 star. Otherwise, the food was just crummy- Mozzerella sticks, Cesar salad (served with ginormous portions of dressing), pizza was bland with dry and hard crust and littler cheese and the Monday pasta special was just pasta, nothing special and could be made at home much better. Several of the pasta dishes came with very little sauce and the server came sparingly to check on us, and didn't even make it to run the check and we paid up front. The only thing that made this experience is being with family, and that was the point of going out for dinner!"
1,"I've been going to Julienne's on and off for the past few years for haircuts and pedicures - it's always been terrific and certainly not worse than some other salons I've been to.  It's low-key there, so I feel comfortable there, and they always offer everyone some type of refreshment.  Last weekend I went in for a haircut and was treated wonderfully by both my stylist Kelly and Julienne herself.  Kelly gave me great cut.  Yesterday, Natalie gave me the Brazilian Blowout, and let me tell you, she did an amazing job.  She took her time, was very thorough and made sure I was comfortable the entire time.  My hair came out great and it was delightful to see how excited Natalie was about my hair - you can tell she really cares and wants a great outcome with everything she does."
1,"crystal, manager and lisa/jennifer are awesome!\n\nthursday nights are $12 all you can eat ribs and it's a great deal!\n\ntheir peach iced tea and apple pie are yummy!"
0,"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
1,"I've always liked going to WoB. The beer selection is unparalleled, as you'd expect. The young male bar tender with a couple of tats has always hooked me up with good beers whenever I wasn't sure what to get and always seems friendly. The service is always very attentive when I'm there and the trivia was cool. Overall great..I just wish they had a couple of beers from Switzerland on their menu!"
1,"This place was fantastic. My girlfriend and I stopped in here yesterday after walking around downtown for quite awhile. One of the best Irish Pub's I've been to in the valley. Had a great, friendly atmosphere with plenty of tv's playing various sports, and of course the races for betting. Great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. I also noticed a really good variety of liquors, especially whiskeys and scotches. We had the fish and chips, fish was very fresh and the steak fries were good. They also make this homemade mac and cheese that was highly recommended by the staff, and for good reason. The prices are very reasonable for the quality, and it looks like they have good happy hour rates. I'd recommend trying this place if you're ever in the area or looking for a solid Irish Pub experience."
1,"Very, very steep indeed.  Just take your time and bring hiking poles...if ever a hike was appropriate for them it is this one.  I only fell once.  A friend might not hurt too.  Seriously, this hike is for people who like the torture of serious uphill and find satisfaction in incredible views in all directions.  This is a pivotal spot to get your bearings in Las Vegas.  You park on the south side of Lake Mead Boulevard at a shut gate that is basically just trying to keep trespassers from driving up (even the lazy want to see good views).  It is the most obvious, straight uphill fire road in the area.  It was worth my effort and took no more than 4 hours total with lots of stopping."
0,"Apparantly after 10 years I've been removed from the delivery zone and told that they have never delivered to me because they have no delivery history. Hmmmm.... I've got 10 years of order history from this store but they have never delivered to me. Never, Never, Never go to this store if you can help it. HORRIBLE customer service!!"
0,"So many bad things, I can't even think of where to start. The girl at the front desk seemed nice enough to start with, but everything changed after we got to our first room. The room was a total mess: bed sheets tossed around, trash on the floor, and cash sitting on the desk. I went back to the front desk and told her that our room wasn't clean, no apologies from her just a second room key. Room #2: air conditioner broken, ants in the bathroom, and no towels. Front desk reaction: \""What's the matter now?\"". Room #3 was the best of the worst, so we stuck with it. The decision to stay at this location was called into question at 2:30am when there were loud noises outside of our door and who is there? The front desk girl chatting with some guy. Horrible experience."
1,"Awesome place!  Dr. Remen and staff are friendly, compassionate and professional.  You know they care about the animal and the owner.  Marge, the groomer, is great.  You know your pet is in gentle hands with her.  I've been to many, many veterinary hospitals and this is by far the best!"
0,"I've been to this location 4 times and will never go back. I've been to the east side location on Monona Dr twice, and absolutely LOVE it! Clearly different owners and standards of service. \n\n1) West side has a male employee who is completely rude. He doesn't make eye contact, he's annoyed when he gets customers (I have been there twice with my friend, twice alone), he's in a huge hurry. Once another employee came in and even they didn't speak to each other. He's just rude. \n\n2) Lots of ingredients are an extra charge. All you might hear is, \""that's a dollar fifty extra, that's fifty cents extra.\"" Not much friendliness happening over there. East side makes it totally pleasant! I'm not sure how, but part of it is just being super friendly and they seem so happy to see you!\n\n3) East side is so busy they have four people behind the counter. They welcome your arrival, smile, are engaged and always have customers. They wear cool uniforms, and everyone says, \""thank you!\"" As a group when they hear you leave a tip. \n\n4)West side uses teaspoons to serve extras, east side uses a spoon larger than a Tablespoon. So for example, I might get 6 cranberries on my Strawberry salad cause of the size of the spoon. East side? 15 cranberries. When I said something to the west side guy, he scoffed and said it would be an extra charge and east side isn't the same place. Pecans? West side a few crumbs, east side? At least 8 nice sized pecans. \n\nI've talked to three people so far who have the same to say about this guy and location. We all understand why the place is always empty. Who wants to be an unwelcome customer paying over 10 bucks for a salad? I would rather go to the Copps salad bar and get my own for less than $7 bucks. Thank goodness, I live on the west side but WORk on the east side, so if I want Salad Creations, I can go to Monona Drive and pay $10 for a salad, and I feel really good about being in there! So much positive energy!"
1,Really like this hotel. My first time here and the room is very spacious and clean. We stayed on the 33rd floor and got a view of the Luxor and Excalibur. I like how there is a starbucks really close by as well as a pastry shop just outside the room elevators. \n\nThe beds are comfy and the restroom is stocked with the essentials. They didn't get a five star because the showers leak when you shower and water gets everywhere requiring us to mop it up with the towels. Also you have to pay $4 for a cup on coffee in your room. \n\nOtherwise love it and will stay here again!
1,i really like this part of town...the sams clubs are always busy though...its best to go in the morning because after the afternoon the lines start getting long! and people in line have alot of item so you can imagine just how long it takes! overall everything seems clean and they have a great freindly staff...
0,"The service was not very good and the food mediocre. Phoenix has many other options that are far superior, especially downtown.  The mixed drinks were nothing worth mentioning (it is a brewery so my own fault there)."
0,"I've read so many good reviews about this place, even a yelp friend (who is very cute) said this place was the bomb. So I tried it...I can't believe the hype. I waited almost two hours to eat here, but to my surprise the combo pan roast didn't live up to expectations. What it basically is a mix of seafood with creamy tomato soup. And what pissed me off was the seafood was so small in portion with the soup. Furthermore, the bowl of seafood tomato soup cost $22! Such a ripoff. Never again."
0,"I bought a Groupon, like other reviewers did, and had an equally difficult time getting an appointment and communicating with Seth (the owner and massage therapist). I never actually spoke to him on the phone, only by answering machine, so booking the appointment was very frustrating and getting a date took about three months. He said he'd sold Groupons before and this happened.... so wouldn't you figure he'd plan a different strategy this time to manage all the influx of clients? \n\nThe spa is a small clinic-type building where Seth has a room and other massage therapists have other rooms (and other business names) that share a waiting area. \nThe massage itself was pretty good. I requested deep pressure, and he did a good job of maintaining that while \""checking in\"" with me twice to ask if the pressure was ok. I've never had my stomach massaged before though. It has never come up in all the massages I've ever had, but he went ahead and did it here without asking me. I didn't  care for it either.....because so much pressure on your abdomen stimulates your digestion and puts pressure on your organs that I didn't care for. I'll leave my digestion to other professionals, thank you.\n\nSo at the end of the massage I got up from the table and my neck felt great-especially since the week before I had had a killer tension headache. The only problem, is Seth completely killed my \""massage buzz\"" by cornering me to purchase a two for $90 deal. Excuse me? I just got up from the table and you're pressuring me to buy this now? It was awkward awkward awkward. This is why I don't go to Massage Envy!!! It would have been more appropriate had he offered this deal and said it was valid for 30days or even better if he emailed me the offer. Instead he said I'd need to pay for it now. No thank you. I didn't appreciate his sales pitch, it was not the appropriate time and made for a weird moment when I was supposed to be enjoying being relaxed."
1,"This is my favorite lunch spot by work. \nYou can load up your salad or pizza with every single topping, and no one bats an eyes. They offer \""pre selection\"" menu options, or you can customize. They also have limited bottled beer, and Bellinis. \n\nThey keep the ovens at near 500 degrees, so your food cooks VERY fast. I've yet to have a pizza undercooked, or burnt. They have it down to a science. \n\nThe staff is friendly, and remembers me, and makes recommendations to \""spice up\"" my usual, and they are always right. \n\nThey are VERY busy during the lunch time, which is great for them, but apparently I've told too many people about my secret lunch spot. \n\nThe ONLY downside, is any way you slice it - it's fast food pizza. It's never going to compare with New York pie. \n\nI will certainly be back :)"
1,Good company. Fair prices and quality work. Enough said!
0,"I walked into the store for the first time this week. It's nicely laid out, but no one offered to help me find anything after I wandered around the store for 10 minutes. No one acknowledged me when I came in or when I left, or ever showed the slightest interest in helping me. All the products are also really overpriced and can be found more cheaply at a department store. $10 for a bottle of nail polish? No thanks! I will not be going back."
1,"I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome. A perfectly cooked medium rare with soup ,appetizer platter and dessert buffet  for around $24 is a pretty awesome deal for me. The service was very good. The meat is most likely not \""PRIME\"" cut but for the price it was delicious. This experience this time around was way better. I would definitely eat here again."
0,I have been to several Planet Fitness since joining a month ago and this location is the worst by far. The bathroom area is always dirty A light has been out in the showers for over a week. Hydro beds don't work right and staff acts like they don't want to be there\n Not a good representation of the chain.
1,"Geez - where the heck is the prior review(s) I've done on Drago ?!?!  The Yelp ghosts are messin' with my mind !\n\nI've been to Drago at least 5 times.  At one point, it was the only bakery in the area ( sugar bee, peridot and others now compete.) \n\nI've eaten a variety of cakes, cookies, cupcakes , etc.  I've even special ordered cakes twice.\n\nMy history with DG has been a roller coaster - highs and lows.  As of late, we're on a high.  I'm a big fan of the mini-pies, especially the key lime and chocolate.  My last visit, I wanted to try the pumpkin pie but they sold out - had to go with the tried/true key lime along with a turtle brownie which I also enjoyed but would really enjoy if it had fewer walnuts on top and more caramel ( pic attached )\n\nDG is my \""go-to\"" in the southwest with Manon my other fav when I want the French-style goods"
1,"As big fans of Bobby Flay, Mesa Grill has been on our food bucket list forever. And his food did not disappoint!\n\nMargaritas - I can understand why Mesa Grill is famous for these. We tried the classic margarita and the cactus pear margarita. The classic was delicious with a good balance of flavors. The cactus pear was sweeter and while it started well, I was over the sweetness by the end.\n\nBlue Corn Lobster Tacos - talk about a flavor explosion... these were amazing! Definitely try these.\n\nGrilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - tender, succulent lamb chops that were grilled to perfection. The mint chimichurri sauce was delicious. It came with a plantain tamale which sounded better than it tasted (again, my aversion to things too sweet).\n\n22oz Bone-in Rib-eye - big, bold, yummy...\n\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts - I know, I know, it's just brussels sprouts. But you haven't had these brussels sprouts. You must get these.\n\nFor dessert we had the Churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise. The star anise was subtle and gave the churros an interesting scent and flavor. It was served with a dark chocolate and a coconut dulce de leche dipping sauce, the latter of which we could have licked out of the bowl. A great way to end the night.\n\nAs for dinner service, it left a little to be desired. Technically everything was executed fine. It's the little details like, the tables that flanked us were seated after us and offered dark napkins due to the customer's dark clothing. My husband and I were also in dark clothing but were not offered dark napkins, so I fussed with white lint on my black shirt the rest of the evening. And the server was effusive in his recommendations and menu explanations to both tables flanking us but didn't offer anything to us. It was weird and an example of how much better everything could have been.\n\nMotivated by the exceptional food, we came back for brunch and had the spicy scrambled eggs - perfect balance of spice, creaminess, sweet, salty, tangy. The service was great this time and it was an awesome way to start the day."
1,"This place is really cool, you drink from glasses made of ice. We had a coupon for a free shot, keep in mind it's the \""shot of the day\"" that you get for free. Pro-Tip .. don't put your cellphone or camera in the cubby/locker as they say you should. It's only so that they can sell you a photo they take for $20 later. Nothing bad is going to happen to your camera/cell phone at 5 degrees Celcius."
1,I like this place.  I have been to the location on west Sahara several times.  I just went to the north Rainbow location and it was actually better than the Sahara location!  The only thing that would earn more stars would be the inconsistent service.  Sometimes it is great and other times it is just ok.
0,"This review is only for the spa itself, did not get a treatment or massage. The facility looks great from the outside, though not so amazing inside. The men's area is rather small, all the advertising about the largest spa is mostly their use of space, not a large bountiful spa itself. Only one jacuzzi which is rather small and only has a jet in the middle. The wet sauna was ok once they got it working. The others were pretty basic and I fully expected much more. I would highly recommend Caesar's as it's much more expansive and varied in it's options. Must say that the service is 5 stars though. Attendants were very helpful and there at every turn, probably since it was pretty slow."
1,"You wan customer service? They go above and beyond. We started getting my young daughter flute lessons here and had them inspect her used flute. The person who did their repairs was out sick and they had someone else do repairs that was filling in. During her next lesson the teacher was not happy with the repairs and we had them loom at it again. They apologized, gave us a free loaner and made a lot more repairs and did not charge us. Really happy with their service and will be a long term customer."
1,"Location, location, location. That's the best thing about this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but what you're paying for is the privilege of dining on the Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Sunday brunch was crowded but we were smart enough to make reservations on our way down there.\n\nThe outdoor patio is the best spot to dine and if you can't get a seat out there, the space just inside isn't bad. It's like a green house -- light and airy with plenty of windows. Further inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes as the space is darker and more intimate. That might be ideal for dinner, but during the day your best bet is the patio.\n\nThe cream of mussel and saffron soup was decent but the prominent \""seafood\"" flavor made it obvious that it wasn't made with the freshest ingredients. The brie and butternut squash quiche ($12.95) was a whole, round, individual-sized quiche. The flaky, crispy crust was the highlight of dish. Not wanting a dish that was too heavy, the lobster tartine ($17.95) was the way to go. Unfortunately, the creamy, citrus flavors dominated the taste of the dish.\n\nThe restaurant is family-friendly. Yes, they've got a kid's menu. The chicken fingers and fries ($6.95) come in a TV-dinner-style tray with three large, thickly coated pieces of chicken, apple slices, green beans, and ketchup. So, if you're looking for a somewhat upscale place with good food to bring the family, Mon Ami Gabi is a good bet. And, of course, if you're on a date, you can't beat the outdoor dining.\n\n3.5 Stars"
1,Just Brakes did a wonderful job.  My last mechanic told me my brakes were fine even after my sensor said they needed replaced. I kept driving until I got another warning on my car that it was critical to fix my brakes.  I came to just brakes and they explained everything thoroughly.  Very knowledgable and friendly staff.  Thank you Jim and the Just Brakes Crew!   Merry Christmas
1,"What more can you want?  I've stayed at the Luxor, MGM Grand and (I can't think right now what it was - some suites a bit off strip).  The Mirage will be my \""go to\"" from now on.  Great sized room for a general suite.  Lots of room to move around, lots of drawers and dressers.  A nice big chair to lounge in.  Flat screen.  A desk with two chairs.  Big comfy king-sized bed.  \n\nThe location was much better than down at the South End of the strip (Luxor) and the mid (MGM).  With the Venetian directly across, Ceasar's and Bellagio nearby.  For cheap gambling O'Shea's was just in reach too.  \n\nI play poker and really feel comfortable in this poker room compared to some others around town.  We ate at Cravings, Japanais and BLT burger and had great food at each one.  \n\nFrom the bag handlers to check in/out to MLife desk support to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and nice.  \n\nGreat experience all together.\n\nUpdate:  Now that I've been to 4 different MLife hotels (Luxor, MGM Grand, Aria and Mirage), I can clearly say that the Mirage wins the all-around favorite."
1,"One of my favorite places to have breakfast - from their eggs Benedict to the famous red velvet waffle, everything is delicious and up to par!\n\nI'm not a fan of their grits, but to each his own. This place definitely gets four stars! Atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Definitely a great eat in the South Park area!"
0,"The NEW location is alright at best,  today was the 3rd time we have been there and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  The place was empty until we came in so you would think they would have time to make our order correct - The amount of gyros on the pita was very sparce along with hardly any sauce, we had to ask for more and paid extra.  We asked for fries extra crispy and they actually came undercooked (barely done at all).  Also, not even hot in temperature.  And neither was the gyros !\n\nOh did I mention the owner and 4 other cooks were in the kitchen along with the cashier......and again I will add NOONE was in the restaurant it was 5:30 now when we got our food.  People started coming in about 6:00 PM or so up until now \""I can't think of a reason our order didn't come right\"".\n\nThere is way to many other places that serves gyros - including their other location not far from this one in chandler.  I guess that's why there were hardly any customers at prime time dinner hour???"
0,"Coming to this McDonald's is like a box of chocolates, cause you never know what a your going to get. A smorgasbord of different experiences. \n\nParked for an iced coffee the last visit and then when it came it tasted like they gave up waiting for fresh coffee and brought me what they had left over from the night before...bitter. Two sips and out the window it went (I kept the cup, I did not litter). Seriously...parked for an iced coffee???  Plus they give me my HOT food to wait for a cold drink. \n\nWithout writing a book, my experience dictates that this location should only be visited during rush hours. The staff seems to lack the mental capacity to understand anything about quality, communication or consistency. \n\nManagement, I highly recommend you re-train your staff on actual McDonald's corporate procedures and learn the guidelines on what is considered fresh...and how to read a clock."
1,Love this place. My wife and I always get the grilled chicken greek salad. Lots of meat and does the job!
0,"This place has gotten too big for their own britches. Can't tell you how many people told us we had to go here while in Charlotte. What a disappointment. The wait staff is dismissive and snotty. The food is average BBQ. I had the ribs. The temp in the smoker was too high and the ribs were not left in long enough. This produces two problems. First, the outside of the ribs were scorched and had an ash taste. Second, the ribs were carrying too much fat that had not cooked down. My wife's pulled pork was almost without flavor. The sides were actually bad and tasted old. On top of that, Mac's serves a variety of local beers. When we asked if we could have a sample of TWO, we were told that we would be charged! I have never heard of that and have not seen that as the norm while here in Charlotte. This place may have all the locals fooled, but don't get sucked in. Lots of other great places in Charlotte that actually want your business."
0,"I've been waiting for an order for 6 weeks. That would be fine if customer service let me know there would be a delay, but I've contacted them 5 times for updates and so far nothing, other than passing the buck and telling me that the product was to be drop shipped by another company. Since I'm in the business of customer service, I found their non-response unacceptable. I'll update the review if there are new developments. I do not like to trash any business so am hoping they redeem themselves.\n\nUpdate from 10/17. Ally from Muscle Driver just called. The product finally shipped from Fisher. I have a tracking number. Still no excuse for the long wait, but good damage control.\n\nUpdate on 10/22. The lack of communication between Fisher and Muscle Driver is astounding. Fisher sent our package through some private delivery service (not UPS, Fedex, or USPS) and they only do curbside delivery and won't give us a window so now I need to take a day off to make sure I can get the package that I should have received a month ago."
1,"From Los Angeles, and have visited Vero Beach for the last two years it was great that old style atmosphere as growing up a dodger fan it was nice to visit the old, but now this spring training facility is huge and all you dodger fans need to come and experience this even if you not a dodger fan because all the stadium are close by if you stay in between the stadiums. If you were in vero beach maybe two or three teams are close by, but here in phoniex 20 to 30 minutes all stadiums are close by just remember traffic is kind of hectic so stay and eat or hang out at the game unitl it ends and most stadiums have places close by.\n\nThough it was the first day, they still need to fix certain things like the parking because getting out is a hassle but I found a better way everybody wants to make a left on Camelback rd so i advise you to go straight on 111th all the way to Indian School rd make a left and about 2 miles you will see the 101 loop. It is also expensive so my suggestion is pay for the lawn seat and walk around and find a seat under the shade.\n\nOf all the stadium in the area easily has that look and feel this is a spring training facility GO Doger Blue!"
1,"We had dinner here a couple of nights ago on the recommendation of my wife's nurse.\n\nI ordered Jasmine tea and spilled just a little bit on the table. I guess the table must have been slanted because when I set my tea cup down, it began to move around as if it was possessed. It was kind of scary/amusing. :-)\n\nWe split three rolls: Spicy Spider, White Dragon, and one more that I can't remember the name of that had eel, avocado, and tuna. They were all very good. My favorite was the White Dragon. My wife's favorite was the Spicy Spider roll. The fish was fresh and seemed to be good quality. \n\nFor desert we split a green tea ice cream which was your typical green tea ice cream.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and seemed to be proud of the quality of the food."
1,"We were in from San Diego and all 6 of us loved our food. The portion sizes were huge, we could have shared. The service was excellent. And you can't beat 99 cent margarita's!! When we're in Phoenix again we'll definitely go here."
1,"We were so fortunate to get two seats at the bar of Emeril's NO Fish House at the MGM Grand in Vegas!!!  This place was packed, most of us waiting in great anticipation for Neil Diamond's concert just around the corner.  We had to stand like sharks and wait to grab our seats as the next guests left, but boy were we glad we did!   We spent the next hour or so enjoying a fabulous lemon creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and several cocktails.  As many of you know, I'm on the hunt for \""real, original, great looking and tasting\"" appletinis and I finally found it at Emeril's!  However, it was only because I spoke to the bartender personally about the ingredients he would used and asked him to substitute \""sweet and sour\"" with Midori.   With that settled, I receive the beautiful, bright green appletini with that burst of flavor only Pucker & Midori can deliver.   I asked for another (not realizing my bartender had changed) and he brought me the cheap, sweet & sour, dirty-martini-looking drink and I told him that was not what I had previously and then had to tell him how to make it).  At least I held my ground and didn't just drink it to be nice.   At $17 to $20 a pop for cocktails in Vegas - get what YOU want, not what you are SERVED!!!   We had such a good time at this bar.  It is absolutely gorgeous and the crowd was fun.  We even had the Neil Diamond look-alike sitting three chairs away from us.  It was too funny - he looked just like Neil did in the 70's!  He, He.  ONLY IN VEGAS!!!"
1,"good lounge spot to hang out at night, the list of wine was solid, and any place that has Gr\u00fcner Veltliner always gets a vote from me."
0,"After 10 years of working in the service industry in fine dining restaurants, I have now officially had my worst dining experience, EVER! \n\nIt was my girlfriends first time in Vegas, so I thought I would treat her to a nice dinner and choose Palm due to its review and close proximity to where we were staying. Our server was great right off the bat; very friendly and bubbly and able to describe the menu and the evenings specials. We started with a beefsteak tomato Capri which was delicious. It goes down hill from here. I ordered the bone in ribeye medium-rare, sides of Au gratin potatoes and creamed corn, and my gf was convinced to order the nights special of prime rib instead of the filet mignon. The sides were more of a highlight than the prime beef. \n\nMy ribeye was cooked more to a black and blue than medium rare - it was okay since I prefer my steak to have its natural juices - but came out at a \""lukewarm\"" temperature rather than warm or even hot. The prime rib must have been given a salt bath for 30 days because it was the most over salted piece of meat I've ever had the displeasure of tasting; no natural flavor existed. Maybe the meat was over salted to cover up its rancid flavor(I'll come back to that comment later). The server was made aware of the dislike of her meal and offered to replace the dish, but my gf had already lost her appetite, so we declined. Not another bite  was taken from the 28oz $60 prime rib by either of us.\n\nLater, our server came back to ask if we were finished eating, and I tell her yes, although there was still a significant amount of food still left on the plates. She quickly picked up our plates and rushed of to the kitchen. I raised an eyebrow to the fact that maybe she was just going to pack the leftovers to go. She returns with a desert menu and offers a desert on the house to make up for the prime rib.\n\nAfter eating the creme brulee (very good, by the way), the server returns with our check. I am now wondering where all our food had gone. I ask the hostess if they pack leftover meals to go and she tells me yes. I explain my situation, to take our meals home was not even offered. The hostess and two managers then seemed to be discussing the issue with the server who returned to apologize for the miscommunication error. The hostess returned to the table with the check and explained that it was MY fault I didn't relay that I wanted the food to go, despite more than 50% of the meal was left. She comped our drinks, but we were still charged for the rancid prime rib. I paid the bill, left a 20% tip and left to never come back again. \n\nEn route to our hotel/casino after dinner, my gf began to feel ill. She threw up what she had eaten, once having to run in to a random casino, and again when we arrived back to our room. I felt fine. We can only assume it was the prime rib that caused her to become ill. It was the only thing she had to eat that I didn't, which leads me to believe the prime rib was turning bad, so it was over salted to cover up the rancid flavor.\n\nAll in all, our server did a great job, except for the leftovers hiccup. The management staff seemed to be a bit snarky and unapologetic considering the experience. I will never return to this restaurant and I will definitely be spreading the word of our terrible experience."
1,"Before there was an Arts District or First Friday, there was the CAC -- promoting art culture in Las Vegas -- run by local artists and volunteers to this day.  The Contemporary Arts Center continues to be a cornerstone of our art community, connecting national and international artists with local artists and audiences.\n\nI joined the CAC because when I moved to Las Vegas, I didn't know where to start and I wanted to volunteer somewhere that mattered, meet people, and connect to the community.  It's been a year now, and mission accomplished: I've met so many wonderful people in the Arts District and even helped put on a few of their exhibitions.  I learned a lot about where to submit my work and what it takes to put on a great show.  Vegas feels like my forever home now, and connecting to the art culture was a big part of that.\n\nBecause the CAC is a 501c3 non-profit organization, it's run by a board of directors, which is open to the public -- so sometimes you have a big board with lots of people and time to plan things, and other years it's just a few people scraping by just to pay the rent.  From short film festivals, to wearable art fashion shows, to controversial paintings on national tour, to brief performance installations ... the CAC doesn't have to stress about whether a piece will SELL, it's whether the piece will MATTER.  And it's because of volunteers who work, and the donors who pay to become members, that this public asset continues two decades later.  How well it's doing depends entirely on how many people will lend a hand and donate a few bucks every year.\n\nLooking through the history has been fascinating about the challenges and successes of these motley crews, and inspiring to see that people from all walks of life can join the organization, have a say in how it's run, and then get hands-on experience with whatever facet of the industry they're interested in.  Artist run spaces can be hit-or-miss, but they're important and rewarding, and the CAC deserves our support."
0,"So I guess if I enjoyed live music and DJ's more (my man works with things like this for a living, so you could say I'm burnt out), I may have been able to disregard how godawful half the place smells. It's like a big urinal punch to the nose, and it sucks, big time. The bartenders are sometimes repulsive but always more repulsed by your presence without cause. It's almost like how Emerald Lounge was, but at least there, you kinda really did feel that you may not be worthy. This place just sucks. \n\nAnd who the hell's idea was it to carpet a bar? Seriously."
1,"Nice hotel, friendly people and a great location. $15 for parking is a drag but the worst is the train. Who builds a hotel on top of an active train track?"
0,I know good thai curry and this was far from it. Service was very good.
1,"If you like real Spanish Tapas, this restaurant is a must.  All dishes are great.  I particularly loved the vaca frita.  My wife loves the remolacha con pollo.  We live in Durham and Malabar is one of the main reasons we visit Charlotte!"
1,"Stopped into this new location today for a pair of their Rugged Exposure Journey Plus walking shoes.  I've been buying shoes at Big 5 for many years & have always done well with them...  This variety, for example, are comfortable right from the start & last me a couple of years.  That's better performance for $20 than I get from Florsheim's that cost $100!     :-))"
0,"Terrible set up for concerts.  For general admission concert tickets, they have the floor split into two sections and make the first people who arrive completely fill up one section before they open the second section.  This punishes the people who stood in line early and arrived first by not letting them line up around the stage.  Consequently, the people who didn't wait at all get the best seats in the house and the people who waited the longest get the worst.  At the Avett Brothers concert, I talked to a husband and wife who camped out since 8am to get close to the stage and ended up in the back because they were made to fill up the first half of the GA section.  Terrible planning."
0,I've eaten here twice waiting for my flight and the food has been awful both times!!  Really bad compared to other Pei Wei's.
1,"Hibachi is normally related to Japanese name. however, I notice all the Asian worker speak Northern CHINESE. \n\nThe place is very  clean - as expected - it is a new.\n\nthe food: good selection, good salad bar, very reasonable price, fresh. it taste approximately equal to other Asian buffet. All good."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE!  Watch out - they will ruin your clothes and then give you the biggest, most expert run around you can ever imagine if you try to get them to replace them.  The owner is a blatant lier and she will rip you off."
0,"I went there because I had a couple of free gift cards.\nWe did the call ahead setting for 6:15pm we got there around 6:10 and waited till around 6:20. At this point we were told to follow our hostess to the table. Ohh wait we haven't cleaned your table yet. So finally around 6:30, when we were able to be seated. We asked out Hostess what the \""Outback Special\"" was, she told me it changes every day, and to ask out waitress. \n\nOur waitress was shortly at our table and took our drink order and our appetizer order. About this time a couple at the next table were seated. (more on them later). When we asked the waitress what the outback special was she said \""it's a steak\"". Everything was going fine, and it was around 7:30 and were were still waiting for our salads/soups. When I looked at the couple who were seated after us,they were getting their entrees. Finally at around 7:45 we got our cold soups and warm salads, My soup had been sitting so long it had that film on the top. Our waitress said they have new people in that back and they are are running behind, they have only been there a few weeks. Finally our food came and then the manager came on her own accord to say the kitchen was running behind. When our food came you can tell that had been sitting for a while as it wasn't \""fresh\"" hot.\n\nEverything else went well, after that. \n\nOverall: I'm not stupid, I knew my food was sitting in the pass for awhile and it's been forgotten about. Don't give me a line, tell me the truth. Comping me a blooming Onion doesn't make good for forgetting about a customer, and then not telling the truth."
1,It was ok.  Was there for Saturday night rib night.  Hubby & I had a 5.00 off coupon.  Really a good deal for the price we paid.  Join the B connected loyalty program for deals.  We would come here again.
1,"Great Happy Hour, music,  wine and appetizers. The atmosphere was amazing,  very relaxing."
1,"We met at the park to carpool to the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center.  I wasn't there long, but it was long enough to know that I wanted to come back and walk to the top of the hill that overlooks the Las Vegas Valley.\n\nThe facilities looked like they were well taken care of and the children's area had a stage coach that the kids were playing in and having a great time.  There are a lot of sidewalks through the area and it seems a great place to walk or jog."
1,My friend got questioned on his ID.. no biggie.. walk in and we got 2 free shots for him. Also my brother knows the DJ and he gave us a shot. Awesome.. we were gonna get on the poll and dance but it moves... lol the base of the poll rolls around... oh shit thats scary when we drink.. lol

0,"I waited in a dressing room, returning to have my dress altered and measured, for 45min. Then Tiffany the assistant Manager, comes out and says \""We can't find your dress\"" . My heart dropped. It was the perfect size and perfect fit, very little alterations would have been needed. \n\nI am still sick about it. The staff just stood around, no one even said they were sorry, we are still looking. No one even looked us in the eye at the counter. They just said we are going to try and overnight the dress from the warehouse. The same warehouse they told me it would take 12 to 16 weeks to get my dress. They did though offer to return our money. \n\nHow hard is it to keep a dress in place?\n\nI am sick about it."
0,"If this place actually hosted the bands they sell tickets for, they'd be good. I have yet to go to a show without a sign out front that says. \"" show canceled.\"""
0,Everything was mediocre.  You are better off going to Burger bar or Carl's Jr. to fill your burger needs.
1,"This place was solidly good. My husband and I ate here when passing through Scottsdale. We actually saw the sign and pulled over because we realized how hungry we were. \n\nWe shared autumn rolls, which were cut up like sushi. They were quite fresh and the sauce was good.\n\nWe each had an item from the lunch express menu. I had the Eggplant with Basil and he had the Mongolian Soy Beef. Both came with brown rice and a salad. I really liked the portions - they were just right. The eggplant was wonderfully tender and the dressing on the salad was tasty. \n\nThe only downsides were that service was a little slow (though quite friendly) and my husband thought the water had a bad smell/taste and he couldn't drink it.\n\nIf we are in Scottsdale again, we'll go back."
0,"My, have times changed...\n\nOn a positive note, I can tell I'm maturing. I find myself having way less tolerance for bullshit and lames. TAO is the first club I went to when I turned 21 and I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or it was just way better three years ago, but TAO was just meh this time around. Don't get me wrong, the venue itself is fantastic. I love the decor and set up but apparently they will let just about anybody in. I mean, seriously, the group of girls in front of us were wearing flip flops.\n\nFLIP FLOPS!!? \n\nWho does that? \n\nIt baffles me that flip flops are allowed but men have to wear collar shirts and dress shoes. Luckily, we got in V.I.P. because if not, the guys would have had to pay for cover to an okay club and that would not have been the biznezz. Three stories with different music on each level. We headed straight to the balcony on the roof top where the pool was. This lounge area was very spacious and included many seats. I couldn't believe it was hot as hell even at 11 p.m. It was hard not to sweat just simply standing there. Grabbed beers and headed back down to the second floor. \n\nThis is where the low tolerance comes in. \n\nSure, the club was poppin' and people were dancing left and right but it was packed. TOO PACKED. I tried to get through to the other side of the bar and there were two girls freaking each other while two guys were behind the girls dry humping the shit out of them taking up the whole walking space. I haven't seen that ish since high school and I'd like to keep it like that. D\u00e9class\u00e9! Then, we tried to get into the main dance floor to party with other people. BIG MISTAKE. I almost made it to the center but had my four ppls stuck behind me. At that point, NOONE was moving. I told myself, \""EFF IT.\"" and started dancing until this guy's back was leaning on mine while he was dancing with some other chick as if I were the only thing holding them up. Another chick looked as if she was passing me and then stopped right next to me and stood there. WTF? Then, everyone trying to get into the main floor started pushing their way in so there go my elbows. Needless to say, I had enough. I headed out and found me a spot to dance my ass off to the same old repetitive crap - I won't say anything good about the music. Actually, it sucked balls. I am over \""apple bottom jeans, boots with the fur\"" as well was \""put your, put your, put your hands up\"" and \""I'm goin, goin' back to back to cali caliiiii...\"" After the day spent at Azure, I could tell I wasn't going to be too content about anything. \n\nI know I know, it's Vegas. What was I supposed to expect? Still though. \n\nEventually we peaced. I was on a good one and we decided to gamble our asses off since we barely spent anything so off to the blackjack table I went..."
1,"Rocky Road Bread Pudding.  Need I say more??  No really. That should be the end of my review.  Because that's all you need to know.  That they have Rocky Road Bread Pudding.  And it's DELICIOUS.\n\nI've also had their sandwiches (WHOA food - no kidding, a sandwich can feed 2 people easily - they're huge) along with their homemade chips (yum!), and also I have had a pasta chicken dish that was tasty as well (not fireworks status but tasty nonetheless).\n\nTheir coffee is spectacular (read: strong) as is their red sangria (don't worry, didn't try them at the same time).\n\nOverall I love this place.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because their homemade chips aren't consistent - sometimes REALLY good, sometimes just \""meh\"".\n\nWhen in the area you must stop in.  Don't forget to try their bread pudding!!"
1,"This is my favorite Indian restaurant ANYWHERE. \n\nLast summer I was in the Pittsburgh area visiting a friend of mine that is from India. He took me to what he said was the best and most authentic Indian food in the country. Udupi is better!!\n\nThe environment leaves much to be desired,  but the food is amazing. A must have is the Paper Dosai Masala. It's a HUGE crispy crepe that has a filling (the masala has a potato filling) and it comes with sambar and chutney to dip it in. The presentation is as wonderful as the flavor. As evidence, the last time I ordered it, the tables on either side of us asked what it was!\n\nThe pricing could be a little cheaper at dinner. I have yet to make it to the lunch buffet so I'm not sure how it compares. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for great Indian food, this is the place to be!"
0,"This is a difficult rating for me to give. The in-store experience was fantastic. The furniture selection is strong and the prices are fair. If I would have rated Living Spaces the moment we left the store they would have gotten a 4 or 5 from me. \n\nBut-- the customer service you receive after leaving the store, presumably from the corporate office, is very poor. We ordered multiple pieces of furniture, including a custom sectional. The couch arrived with one of the pieces of furniture made with the wrong fabric. They never followed up with us like they promised -- we had to call three times. It took a month to get a replacement piece. Also, the driver tripped on his way in the house ripping the fabric on another piece-- it has still not been replaced.\n\nBefore I received this bad service I made the mistake of recommending them to my parents. They told my parents the drivers would call a half hour before they arrived to deliver their furniture-- it didn't happen, they just showed up. When my father wanted to return a couple pieces that didn't work out, they told us they would call a day before to give us a pickup window. It never happened. We've waited all day today for it to come-- it is now after 6pm, they never showed, never called. \""Good bye\"" to my Saturday, thanks Living Spaces!\n\nThe good people who work at the Scottsdale store are really undermined by the corporate office, it's too bad. I would pass on Living Spaces because of it. The customer service department is awful. They aren't accountable. And they apparently have no communication with the drivers. Bottom line, they just aren't ready for the business. The only reason I didn't rate them a \""1\"" is due to the positive shopping experience."
0,Worst DD I've ever been to. Today I tried to use a gift card. I was told that their machine didn't work and wouldn't accept it. I asked if I could have a coffee. They said only if I had cash which I did not have. So no coffee. Will never go there again. I'm only giving this one star because zero stars is not an option.
1,"My first thought upon entering Chompie's, \""what a neat little restaurant\"". It's a sit down restaurant, diner style. It's a bakery. It's a deli. All in one.\n\nRight after being seated we were served our drinks and a plate of pickles and cucumber pickles (yes, I know all pickles are cucumbers but these were halfway between still being a cucumber and a full blown pickle). Odd but a delicious and surprising appetizer.\n\nThe menu is expansive... I was overwhelmed. I was originally craving a sandwich yet after quickly scanning the menu I noticed there was not a single veggie option. Sad, I moved on and quickly found 3-4 other entrees to decide between.  I finally settled on ordering the Israeli Couscous Fitness Salad *see picture*. It was HUGE and delicious. The lemon infused olive oil dressing was perfection. And I love that it came with a bialy as I badly wanted to try one here. If you are curious it's like bagel only not... it's a yeasty soft centered, crusty on the outside roll. A staple in Jewish and Polish dining. My friend ordered the Fitness Omelet which came with choice of healthy side and a bagel or bialy of your choice. She and I both enjoyed our meals and finished each bite. \n\nBeing a NY style Jewish Deli, I knew not to expect too many vegetarian choices,... there are however a few options, they accommodate special requests, and there is the daily soup which is vegetarian chili.  I was also impressed at the Polish-esque  entrees, I did not try since nothing compares to my grandma's cooking in that department.\n\nService was friendly and attentive even though the place was quite busy. As a UofA alumni, I could have done without every single server wearing ASU gear but I was in their territory after all."
1,"One good thing about large chains is they make you really appreaciate a place like this.  \nSmall, rustic and no one ramming apps or desserts down your gullet. \nA James Beard award winner for local fare, The Fry Bread House is great!  Big taco like creations with their amazing fry bread. The green chili sauce is outstanding.\nYou also need to make room in your belly for their dessert. It's chocolate sauce on their fry bread. Amazingly simple and extremely addictive. My hands looked like a fight scene from The Matrix as to how fast I ate it! \nParking lot is super tiny and I heard the lunch crowd is huge (not large in weight just lots of people)."
1,"Okay...I gave this place 4 stars but.....way overpriced. However Las Vegas seems to be overpriced on just about everything. This was however a decent burger. Id go back...just make sure I wasn't paying haha. $18 for a burger, fries and a coke. $14 would be the most id pay for this. I give BLT burger an 82/100"
0,"Let me preface this by saying that I really like Zipps. I love their foccacia, 1/2 and 1/2 side, and cheap happy hour drinks. Usually we go to the location in Old Towne, but we met a friend up North and figured it's always a safe space to go. Our food lived up to our expectations.\n\nThe 1-Star rating goes to the full credit of our server who was stuck-up and unhappy from the get-go. My food came out wrong, she charged me extra for asking to have the dressing on the side, and she insulted my mathematical intelligence by writing and circling our total bill on my credit card receipt because my friend paid cash. All of this with frequent eye-rolls. She even managed to make me feel bad about my food coming out wrong - without so much as an apology.\n\nAs a summary, here are words that I would use to describe her attempt at serving:\n1. Rude\n2. Uninterested\n3. Arrogant\n4. Nickel-and-dimer\n5. Inconsiderate\n6. Disrespectful\n7. Insulting\n8. Impatient\n9. Neglectful\n10. Blatantly immature\n\nBecause of her poor service, I talked to the manager about our experience before we left (Take my word for it, it really was that bad). He apologized for our experience, and was quite friendly. She responded by saying rude things about our table to over 5 of her co-workers within earshot of our table.\n\nThis experience was a disgrace to all of the great times we've had at other Zipps locations, and my only hope is that this is an isolated incident."
0,I cannot believe this venue is allowing it's customers to stand in the Arizona heat literally passing out instead of letting them in to get a break from the heat! You tell me you're handing out waters....more like selling them for 3 bucks a pop! Complete bs. I am so disappointed.  Mad even.  My money allows you to stay open...customer first!  And if anything happens to my kid while she's there my review now will be sweet compared to what I do!
1,"Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact.\n\nEveryone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service. \n\nI absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation. \n\nI was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway."
1,"Yes, I am a fan of this place, always crowded for the lunch rush but your numnber gets called quickly.  Im going with the 3 beef enchiladas today, after I ordered someone walked by with the green and red chile, I am getting that next time!"
1,You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The brisket is phenomenal and you can't pass on the sausage.  Good beer selection and great traditional BBQ comfort sides.
1,"This guy is pretty awesome! Last year around this time (late spring, early summer) my house had a ridiculous number of crickets. \""Never again!\"" I said. Read reviews on Yelp and everything was as advertised. Talked to other companies who typically offer a monthly service while Lights Out takes care of business with one visit that lasts months which ends up much cheaper. Then, he gives free advice on how to keep the bugs out. Jason showed me cracks in my security and advised me on where and how I could seal the outside of my home to prevent bugs from entering."
1,"This a a new trendy place in the mill ave district. Breakfast here is delicious, although the portions are on the smaller side so if you're starving it might not be the best choice. \n\nTip: best bloody Mary I've ever had."
1,"Thanks to some friends coming into town I got to check out The Westin Kierland Resort, what a great looking place! Very grand.\n\nRoom 2163 was the spot, and I have to say I was sort of shocked because it was on the small side; the bathroom had a shower stall  for one, not even a bathtub. \n\nThere was a nice size king bed that was comfy. My friends brought their dogs with them and the resort does provide kennels, food bowls and even a heavenly doggy pillow for them to sleep on, I thought that was pretty sweet.  The doors opened up to a outside seating area next to the lush green grass.  The room also had a desk, comfy love seat, mini bar, a mini sink & counter top, just over all was a very small room. \n\nCheck out 2 of the pool areas, one where the lazy river is at, posted everywhere it says the lazy river is opened till 7, but we went for it around 6:30 and we were told it was already closed.  This pool area closed at 8pm but we just walked across and went to the pool that's opened 24 hours and hung out there. \n\nOver all enjoyed my time at the Westin Kierland, looking forward to booking a staycation soon!"
1,"After walking out of Osaka due to their bad service we decided to give Naka Sushi a try. \n\nWe chose the All-You-Can-Eat option for $21.95 for adults and $10.95 for the kids. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the food was good, the Saki was very nice. The included item selection was excellent. My only complaint was the lack of fresh wasabi (Totally different from the regular wasabi that everyone is used to), which is missing in about 3/4 of all sushi places I have been to, but the owner promised to order some for next time.\n\nWe'll definitely be back!\n\nmore reviews at http://www.thevegasevent.com"
0,"I have had my car washed here once before and was very impressed with the level of detail that the guy took with the interior. As a result I chose to return with my car for an. interior detailed specifically. \nI explained that I wanted to have the carpets cleaned and the interior cleaned thoroughly. The vehicle is only two years old so this isn't a difficult task. I dropped the vehicle off and was told it would take an hour and a half to two hours. 45 minutes later I received a phone call telling me my vehicle was done.\nWhen I arrived it took only a moment to discover that the interior had hardly been touched. They had wiped down my leather seats with some shiny substance and touched nothing else. The guy had the audacity to ask me if the job was acceptable    \nI politely explained that obviously there was some type of miscommunication and that my vehicle was not complete. I pointed out several obvious areas that established the vehicle still needed to be vacuumed, the dash still needed to be wiped down, there \nwere drip spots on the console where the straw in my drink had flipped fluid and dried. \nAs they began the process of actually cleaning my vehicle, The bullshit excuses began. These guys actually suggested that they chose not to armor all my wheels, and extra that I had been charged for specifically, because it \""stains the wheels over time\"" ridiculous!!!\nIn the end I was charged $80 for an interior detail with carpet cleaning, the majority of which was never done. Total scam artists stay away!!!"
0,"In short, the food is overpriced and lack luster. \n\n\nI went here after being stuck at a filming session all day. I hadn't eaten in many hours and was starving. This was one of the closer things nearby, so me and my coworkers headed to Beckett's Table. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice. The restaurant looks swanky and modern. The service is great. Our waitress was very prompt and attentive. \n\nThe menu was tiny. \n\nThere are only a handful of main courses available. And they are full of 'fancy' ingredients that just seem to complicate what should be a simple dish. The wine list is extremely long. Like, three pages long. I really wish the menu was that long, but alas it fits on one side of a place-mat. \n\nAnd let's not forget how pricey this stuff is. You won't get a main dish for under $15. And some dishes run into the $25 range. \n\nThe food itself was okay. They give you these small rolls while you wait for you meal. Those were awesome. My friends told me that their meals weren't too bad. Nothing spectacular, but not horrible either. My first meal was too spicy, so I sent it back for another cut of fish (salmon). The fillet was tiny and not overly warm. \n\nFor dessert, we ate a piece of chocolate cake type thing. It was okay. \n\n\nOverall, the service is great. If you're into wine, there is a lot to pick from. The food is overrated and so are the prices."
0,"My wife and I have tried only the lunch buffet, since they do not serve from the menu during lunch.\n\nMaybe I have been spoiled by the excellent Indian food in and around San Francisco, i.e. Pakwan, Shalimar, and others. At any rate the food at Ghandi is mediocre and overpriced: $11.99 for the lunch buffet, loaded with bland vegetarian dishes and a few chicken-scrap entrees.\n\nOh, well, I may try another Indian restaurant in Las Vegas, though I may just wait until the next time I'm in San Francisco."
1,"2nd time and it was a Charm! \nIt was another amazing experience at this store for me once again!  I went in a year after my first purchase as my hubby was treating me again for another pair of shoes. \n\nWe walked in to a busy store.  The gentleman there is not very friendly and you can tell he does have preference to whom he helps, but the gal and I can't remember her name was very friendly and helpful.  I tried on some Eliza Pigalle and those were so uncomfortable, I asked for the Decollete's in nude and some Bianca's to try.  She brought out both pairs at once for me to try and I took both!  \nI forgot to call my credit card company that I was leaving town, so Fraud alert was placed on my card in which she was very understanding and told me to take my time to resolve.  Took no more than 5 minutes and issue was resolved and I walked out with my 2 new pairs!   So in love!"
1,"We love going here for movies. Not only is it nestled in Town square where we can go check out dozens of shops and food while we wait, it's a fun atmosphere. We had a problem with our tickets printing and the manager kindly helped us and made it NO problem for us. We even got to leave and come back and just walk in because he promised that he would be at the front waiting for us in an hour (and he was!) Great customer service! There was a separate bar area (fun!) and the popcorn was yummy (though as typical movie theater food/drink is super overpriced but we didn't mind due to the service we received.)\n\nWe will be coming back to see our movies here from now on!"
1,"food was great, large portions. the server was very friendly and attentive. will definitely go again!"
0,"Taco Bell has really been pimping out their Happier Hour specials with the rolled tacos and $1 drinks. Figured it was a safe spot to grab a late lunch/snack to share with my BF, as we'd planned on a late dinner.\n\nOrdered two of the tortilla rolls and a medium Baja Blast, and was really confused when my total came to $6. Figured maybe I was early for the HH pricing or had missed fine print somewhere. Order was out quick via drive thru.\n\nAnd when I pulled up at home I realized the mistake. Somehow my order was doubled to two of each of the two tortilla rolls, and a nacho wrap was thrown in. A little frustrating, since that now made a gigantic amount of food instead of a snack, and I hate wasting.\n\nBut then I tried the food. And the nacho wrap was about the only thing that was edible. The tortilla rolls were two different types: a chipotle chicken flavor that was somehow just a couple of grilled chicken pieces and a ton of sour cream, then a chili cheese fry flavor that had spicy chili in an amount that seemed like it was trying to cover up the fact that the potatoes were burned. And oh yeah, there was no cheese. Weird.\n\nThe Baja Blast was just meh. I'm not a caffeine fan and for some reason I thought this drink was more of an Icee/Slurpee, but it's just a flavored Mountain Dew. \n\nEven with the order being butchered and the food being subpar, I didn't expect my stomach to hurt afterward. Yet it did... and from the other reviews here, that seems to be a regular occurrence."
0,Well I'm sure as you can see in my last review things didn't go so well so he said he was no longer working on rhinos so I waited and waited and waited and finally after multiple promises to get my rhino in there and take care of the problems he went back to no longer working on rhinos!\n\nwe went round and round that he had promised and I had waited multiple months for him to make the repairs right that he did and he ended up again going back to I don't work on rhinos I reminded him that I waited for months I've been patient I've been a long-term customer he just doesn't care!\nMike is one of those guys that if you can get your money and doing easy repair he's happy to do it if anything goes wrong it's never his fault he doesn't want to do anything to make it right and now he's flat out telling me he will not stand behind the work that he's done I would never take anything there again by her beware this guys a scumbag.
0,I will first off state I will never be returning to any Bevmo. \n\nI decided to place an on-line order on the bevmo website to make things more convient. After deciding what I wanted it gave me two options either pick it up in the store or have it delivered. I chose to pick it up. I was then prompted to enter my credit card information. This was going to work perfectly as my girlfriend needed my debit card. \n\nI drove down to the store after work to pick up my order. When I arrived the first gentleman asked for my credit card first thing( not even my ID). I let him know that I already paid on line and I showed him the printed confirmation page I had with me. He said let me get the manager and walked off. I was left standing there wondering why he even needed the manager as he did not explain to me. The next gentleman came up who introduced himself as the manager. He told me he needed the credit card. I explained to him why I did not have it. \n\nI asked why they had the ability to order on line and pay using a credit card if I needed to bring it in with me. He told me so I didn't have to stand in line. Well this makes sense except with one huge flaw! Why not have the website setup to place the order and then require the payment to be made once you arrive at the store. \n\nI work in the credit card processing industry and from a business standpoint there there should be no reason to charge the card on line if you require the card to be presented once they arrive. \n\nYou pay twice as much for a keyed transaction on line than if you were to swipe the card in person(which makes the most sense since your required to bring it with anyways). I was refunded the money but guess what now I cannot use that money for 24-48 hours until it has been released back to my card which completely screwed me out of leaving and purchasing beer later. \n\nThis is a completely unacceptable way to  operate an on line service that is put in place for convience when it does the complete opposite and does nothing to speed up the process.
1,"Planned a large dinner party for a work event at Border Grill for the 2nd year in a row.  After spending hours in a trade show hall, it's nice to dine out on the patio! :)  Great service, great prices and super tasty food!  I would recommend the skirt steak and their guac rocks.  Had dinner on Tues and then lunch again on Thurs. Love this place."
0,"This was my first time to Vegas and my first time at this hotel and it was a bad experience. This hotel is on the opposite side of \""fun\"", it's in the \""ghetto\"" area! Right when we walked into the hotel they try to get you to sign up for this 2.5 hour tour to take you and show you their other hotels that they just opened - which sure they offer you a free stay at any of their resorts for doing this tour but seriously who wants to be bribed right when they walk in? We did put our names down with a $20 refundable deposit just in case we did want to do this, but in the end we wanted a refund - which took them 30 minutes to even find our name on their list and we had to come back 2 hours later to get our $20 back and they STILL tried to sell us ANOTHER deal - VERY disorganized and annoying! We were able to check in 4 hours before our check in time, which was very nice and for a VERY reasonable price, but we had to ask the front desk ourselves -  NO ONE told us we were able to do that, everyone acted like that wasn't even possible. The room was OK, I've gotten cheaper hotels that at least had a microwave and fridge in it. Unfortunately, within the first 30 minutes of settling into our room my fiance and I were trying to rest and a lady seriously knocked on our door TWICE and RIGHT AFTER she walked in!!! The pool was nice, but the Jacuzzi was dirty. I was not able to check out the rides- the lines for the ride were super long!If anything good came out of this experience it was the floor with the food and shopping area, it was pretty nice- the Mexican food place was on point; VERY fresh and yummy with a for sure reasonable price! I would NOT come back here again."
1,"The best dive bar in Tempe that features Live Music with no cover charge.  All the employees here are nice and treat you with respect.  The beer is cheap and the service is good.  There is shuffle board and darts to keep you entertained between music sets.  \n\nEven though the location is a little bit dumpy it adds to the dive bar factor and keeps the douschbags away.  If your not a douschbag and want to try something different, check out this place."
0,"What era is this?\n\nThat was my first thought as I stepped into this restaurant.  Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \""Scarface.\""  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. \n\nI came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   \n\nThe menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. \n\nFor starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. \n\nWe all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)\n\nFor my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. \n\nA few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.\n\nDessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. \n\nIn my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check."
1,"This place is a ton of fun. Good theaming, and service. The food is great and its a good place to drop into. I recomend it enough to say very proudly that I went there twice in one day. It has to be good to do that right? Right? Go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chase out!"
0,"It's our own fault for trying it but my son was in town and we had to dare each other to try the Food Network Special. It's called \""Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow\"". It does not misrepresent the fact it is super hot, which it is but there is absolutely no flavor to the meal at all. If you're going to call attention to something, at least make an attempt at adding flavor to the heat. Tried the Chile Colorado at the Original location yesterday for lunch and again it was just bland, No flavor. I added my rice and beans to it so it had some flavor. Not impressed. There has got to be better nearby."
0,Meh. I've experienced better. The staff is friendly. Just basic chinese food.
1,Pretty good fish tacos! Didn't like the shrimp taco tho. Chips & guac were delicious. Will come back to try breakfast burritos.
1,We met some long lost friends here last night.  Fast and efficient service.  The only issue was that music was to start at 9:00pm...we left at 10:30 and the music still had not begun.  At least we were able to chat with our friends but we were a bit disappointed as the sound check sounded great.  The fish sliders were super!  Potatoes skins needed salt.  I'd certainly go back.
1,"This Java U is located right on the outskirts of Old Montreal close to downtown, probably an ideal location for street traffic from locals to/from work, and to tourists walking to/from the old part of the city. I, of course, was one of the latter. I really enjoyed the vibe walking into the building- the decor was very hip, trendy, but upscale with beautiful chandeliers overhead.  Leather chairs adorned the front for the coffee drinkers/hang-outers, while the back opened up nicely to a bunch of tables for people who stopped in for a meal. The staff were very nice and friendly to the English-speaking tourist, and the coffee and the pastry that I purchased tasted great."
0,"I really wanted to like this place.... But... \n\nI flew into town to surprise my father for father's day weekend.   On Saturday night I asked the family where they would like to go for Father's day brunch and they recommended Betty's Nosh.  \n\nA quick check of Yelp showed some average reviews, but the parents had gone there and liked it... so how bad could it be right??\n\nSo I booked a reservation online for 10:30am.   When we arrived, the hostess told me that \""I was set to be sat outside... Is that ok?\""   Since it is Glendale in June and the temp was well over 100, we asked to be sat inside... Note the reservation never gave an indoor or outdoor option.   So they said they would \""move some things around\"" but we had to sit at the \""high top\"" tables.    I was fine with it, but my mom has a bad back/leg thing happening and she eventually agreed.\n\nAs we walked to our table, I noted a sign on the door to the outdoor patio that said \""outdoor patio closed due to heat\"".   I thought this to be odd as they were just going to sit us out there.... \n\nSo we order our food.... and for brunch, several of us ordered coffee.   We were told that all their creamer had \""gone bad\"" and they gave us two small containers of skim milk.... Didn't really do much to their dark coffee.... But really?  You can't send someone to the store to buy cream for your Father's Day Brunch service?\n\nIn the front of the place, they have a pastry display with a latte machine.   My wife ordered a latte and we were first told essentially that nobody working knew how to work the machine.... they later changed their story to the lack of a creamer.... Again, Father's Day Brunch, they know they are out of cream yet it is beyond them to send someone to the store to buy some....\n\nService was SLOW.   We saw 6 or 7 employees.... all appeared to be doing something, but I only saw two actually waiting on tables.\n\nThen the food comes.....\n\nMy mother's omelet had the wrong ingredients, she sends it back.   At the same time she noted it was \""al carte\"" and ordered some has browns with her new omelet.\n\nMy father's omelet was wrong, but he ate it.\n\nMy omelet was ordered with jalapeno peppers, I didn't notice any... I still ate my omelet.   I noted (see photo) it was SWIMMING in oil.... Not just a little oil, like enough oil to over my entire plate with a 1/4 inch of oil... It was really disgusting.\n\nMy wife ordered Eggs Benedict.  It was basically just thrown on a plate... No garnish, no effort to make it look nice and the \""homemade\"" English muffin wasn't toasted...a basic thing on eggs Benedict.... She eats it... doesn't send it back.\n\nMy mom's second omelet comes.... and guess what?.... wrong again... We send it back again.... but by this time we have all been done eating for quite a while... My mom ends up eating a small bowl of fruit.\n\nAs they are cleaning up our plates, the side of hash browns my mom ordered arrived, she sent it back as we were leaving....   The blueberry muffin I ordered within the first few minutes of sitting down arrived.... perhaps 40 minutes later... when we were all done eating..\n\nNow here to their credit they did some things right:\n\nThey recognized that they had messed up my mom's meal... and they sent over the \""owner's assistant\"" ... who apologized about getting the omelets wrong....  They ended up not charging us for the two omelets my mom never ate... and took a bloody Mary off the bill.   They also gave my mom a gift card for $25.00\n\nBUT essentially they didn't do any dish right.... ingredients were missing, muffins not toasted, meals floating in oil.... They couldn't even make a latte or provide cream with coffee for a Sunday Brunch.  They missed on EVERY level.  When I mentioned this to the \""Owner's Assistant\"" she seemed surprised we weren't happy with the food that did come.   I even told her about the excessive oil and she told me they had an \""experienced omelet chef\"".\n\nI will come back as it appears they do care... I'm really hoping I caught them on a bad day.... Perhaps breakfast just isn't their thing?"
1,"I'm digging these new CityCenter properties in the mid-Strip area. Thumbs up for the clean modern design aesthetic Vdara utilizes that makes the room feel a little more like an upscale condo and less like a run-of-the-mill hotel room. Well, I guess the fact there's a kitchen with a stove probably contributes more to that \""homey\"" feel too.\n\nI liked that the shower door didn't leak.  Sounds kinda dumb to point that out, but I had a small lake replete with fish pooling around my shower at Palazzo.  The sink was one of those trendy rectangular models that looked cool but functionally sucked. The near-flat bottom made sure that draining water never drained well, and when there's two guys shaving with razors it meant splashing water around futilely trying to clean up the place for the next person. \n\nI absolutely loved the fact that I didn't need to walk six kilometers through a smokey casino to go from the lobby to the guest elevators.  In fact, there is no casino at Vdara and the closest one is probably Cosmo next door.  The downside is that there's no direct connection to Cosmo, but it's not a big deal.  Vdara *is* connected via walkway to its sister property Bellagio.  It's a long route to take, but made easier if you make a pit stop at Jean-Philippe's for some chocolate.\n\nThe beds were comfy, the room nicely appointed and we had a decent view looking north towards the water show at Bellagio.  The gym wasn't huge with maybe 10 treadmills/ellipticals and a dozen machines plus free weights, but it was also so empty that it wasn't a factor. Plenty of towels and water made a quick workout a breeze. Good location and everything above makes it a solid 4 stars for me. Looking forward to my next stay here."
1,"was at the brio tonight food was great  alittle  pricey,,,"
1,"What a lovely place. I am eating one of the very delicious Saumon quiches at this very moment. I love that the place is small and cozy. You could come here on a date or with some friends to hang out and enjoy some fresh baked pastries or an assortment of other items like sandwiches,soups,salads,coffee,crepes,etc. I like being able to see into the kitchen and watching the bakers/chefs as they work. So much to chose from, will have to return to sample other items on the menu."
1,"My Father's coworker gave him a business card of this place and gave high remarks of their massages here. He passed the info. to me and I finally had the chance to check it out. It's located southbound on Arville St., make a left after the neon purple lingerie novelty shop. \n\nIt's HIGHLY recommended to make an appointment here. It was busy and completely packed with guests when I walked in. Luckily, we made an appointment, but due to a miscommunication it was suppose to be for four not three. Since I arrived 10 mins early and checked in. Dina, who was at the front desk asked me for the last four digits of my phone number, but I told her my friend is the one that made this appointment and it should have been for four not three. She was kind enough to change and accompany us in this last minute mix up. \n\nAs I was waiting for the rest of my group, a party of five and a couple walked in without an appointment. Instead of bumping us like in nightclubs for table reservations.. there wasn't any greed here. I admire Dina for being loyal to her appointments and letting the walkins know they are booked right now. The couple stormed out angry without even accepting her business card that she tried to give them. The big group understood, left quietly, and didn't make a scene about it. My friend requested all female masseuses, but I stood up and said.. excuse me.. I would like a strong man. The front desk lady, Dina.. my two friends turned around and go whoa okay... not me. Dina knodded her head and said okay.. okay.. she wants a strong man. Usually even though I request this, I don't get a strong masseuse. Dina gave me what I asked for. \n\nThey are quite punctual with time and Dina asked if we are ready yet. Even though one in my party was only a few minutes late. She asked us if we can go in first and she will let my friend in when she arrives. \n\nThere are about twelve seats in one big room, dim lights, and relaxing music playing. If you have sensitive skin and don't want any lotion on your face... let the masseuse know before you start. You begin with putting your feet in warm water, then you lay on your back on a comfy chair/table. My masseuse, Frank started on my forehead and worked his way down to my neck. Then at my mid back.. lifting it up with his fingers and lowering at each section as he moved up to my neck. Then my arms and fingers. At one point after massaging my hands, he punches the palms of my hand like we're sparring, but I don't have any gloves on. In my mind, I'm like WoW... and held in my laugh, but shined a smirk of being hit like that. He wasn't being easy on me and Dina must have told him I wanted a strong man :P Good lord was he!?!? After that, he went down to my feet. Wrapped one up in a towel and went to town on the other. Pain... oh the pain!!! With his knuckle, he slowly pierced through the bottom of my feet and rolled his knuckle down. I seriously wanted to scream. Felt like Fire... but I clenched my teeth and distracted the pain by fond memories that always brings me to a happy place. I did this throughout my entire massage session. Once he moves to a different section, what a relief!!! Pain then pleasure.. then it's pleasure and then again.. Pain. Ooooh it hurts so bad, but feels so good!!! Then with his knees in between my legs, he massages my thighs and calves. Even massaged my glutes! If you don't like to be touched period.. this might not be the place for you. He literally stretches the heck out of every part of my body. He then asks me to flip over and he works his forearm on my back. Then stretches my arms. Punches my back and wah laa!!! I'm a new woman. I sat up and both my friends started laughing crazy at me. My hair apparently resembled a lion and strands were sticking out high as the sky. All good.. that's when you know you had a great massage! :) \n\nGreat deal and service. Tip double for their hard work, they deserve it. Convenient place to stop by after a hectic night at work, but call first and make an appointment or they might very well be booked up. My friend went yesterday and was amazed by their massage, so she went back Again with us tonight! Definitely returning for more pain.. sooner than later."
0,Bartender is rude. Don't know his name but he is middle aged white guy that works nights. He is sassy and he must think he is so great and everyone else is beneath him. I would rather east somewhere else than eat at this Chili's.
1,Awesome spot! From the food to the drinks this place is off the chain! Make sure to see John at the bar.... Best bartender in town! He serves up some of the best cocktails around!
1,Ichiza another great place  to eat and drink hang out with a group of friends in Vegas ...Great yakitori  there beef tataki are awesome ika-yaki good. There whole wall is basically a menu so don't be shy to ask the waiter waitress what are they. There's so many other good things also And for dessert don't forget just ordered a honey toast..... I'll be coming back soon. Make sure to make reservations it's get kinda crowded.
1,"Good food, good drinks, reasonable prices. Definitely a great place to start the night!\n\nI highly recommend their gourmet burger and huge margarita! The Irish nachos are a must-try as well.\n\nThe waitress we had was super cool, too. She did a great job and it was really nice of her to let my wife keep the large margarita glass as a souvenir. We were humbled and very grateful for the gift.\n\nIf I ever go to Vegas again, this is definitely a place I'd go to again without question."
0,"This hotel has declined over the past years. We had a late check in and did not get the room we reserved. Understandably since we were late, however they gave us the worse room in the building. It was small and dark with absolutely no view at all. We were told by the front desk that we could have a room change in the morning, we never heard from those at the front desk as promised. Nonetheless we suffered through another night of noise and constant banging from who knows what. The walls are paper thin so good luck getting any rest. The furniture can use a makeover as well, the writing desk was burnt from possibly an iron?? I will not be staying here again regardless of deal they are having.  The reason I gave it 2 stars was the ease of checking in and the staff was very kind."
0,"I don't know why.... I have been to Wynn buffet like 3-4 times in the past 10 years.....\n\nThis time is the worst experience....compare with M-resort and Wicked Spoon, Wynn offers less choices but it is more costly......."
0,"Had high hopes but found pizza boring and plain.  Not enough sauce and way too much cheese.  Menu states thin crust but it was more like a medium  thickness.  Now that said, for the price, fine, but you get what you pay for right?  Case in point with Say Cheese's pizza."
1,"Another restaurant visit inspired by Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Went with my friend while visiting her in Charlotte. Was very excited to try their fish tacos and was not let down!\n\nThe meal started with their unique corn salsa, a delicious mix of corn kernels, green bell pepper and tomoatoes served with tortilla chips.\n\nFor lunch I ordered their Tuna tacos with a honey wasabi sauce which was served with a side of mashed potatoes mixed with jalapeno peppers sliced in and cheese. The tacos were excellent with plenty of tuna and the wasabi sauce was unique, tasty and had the right amount of kick to it. While mashed potatoes are not usually thought of as a Mexican side dish, they were delicious and the jalapenos and cheese really added to their flavor. The whole meal washed down with a local Charlotte craft beer was the perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon!"
0,"This review is based on how well the school prepared their past students for high school. My son just went to 8th grade there. \nIt seemed like a majority of the kids started at a very young age and goes there through junior high. Saying this, the school has one method and one method of teaching which I would say is not good for the student. The students will struggle once they leave the school cause they only understand one method. \nMy son was in the lowest pre-algebra class. He was struggling with the method because all the other kids grew up learning this method. The teacher Mr. Bitter even told our son that he shouldn't go into Algebra 1-2 in high school. Well he went into public high school and struggled a little but nothing a tutor couldn't help him with. He's now doing really well in Geometry. Another former student that was in the same grade as my son was in honor math. Anyways, they are now both in public school and the same Geometry class. My son is doing better than the junior high honor student. \nAlso, another former junior high student from the school was a honor student and went to the same public high school. After two weeks of school she was failing classes and moved back to PVCP for high school. This shows that they did not prepare the kids for high school. \nMy son is in honors Spanish 3-4 at the public school. He said that the 8th grade Spanish teacher was teaching the same thing as he is learning now in honors 3-4. This tells me the teacher doesn't know how to progress the students correctly. Don't just push them through a class but learn to teach. \nSo overall, I feel that this school does NOT prepare the kids for high school or college correctly. It was a big mistake to send my kid there. Save your money and send them to public school. If your worried about Christian values then teach them at home. That's what parents are there for. It's not the schools responsibility to teach these values."
0,"Granted I haven't been in since my \""experience\"" I really don't have a desire to go back.\n\nThe night my friend and I decided to give it a whirl.. well, we drove up and the parking lot was full of Cadillacs and Buicks. Should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked. \nThere was a very large, foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door. Hmmm.. We walked up and he looked at us like, what are these two white girls doing here? We were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building (which was all of them), swung around to look at us. It was, seriously, just like the old Westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes. \nWe stood there, for a hot second, a guy started hitting on my friend so I pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of there.\nI could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left.\n\nHmm.. maybe we were there on the wrong night.\n\n\n\n**For the record, because I'm sure someone will get offended... I am in no way racist and I would have LOVED to stay and party with everyone. The only reason we left was because we felt entirely, completely unwelcome."
1,"Great place for BBQ in Anthem. When you get a chance try their creation called the Hog Dog, don't be scared it's not as spicy as the description may imply. The Ribs are better than average, the fried macaroni and cheese lacks flavor. As for everything else on the menu, it's great. I can say that because I have tasted the whole menu already."
1,"Excellent!! My fiancee and I went here. The staff was very welcoming, very attentive and friendly. The food outstanding! I have never had Buffalo and I must say I have been missing out. It was cooked perfect along with my filet mignon. We had French Onion soup and escargot that was so delicious. We finished off with creme brulee flambe that alo g with the view it was delish. Allow around fantastic place to eat. The best meal I had in Montreal,if I came back it would definitely be to eat here."
0,"I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand."
0,"I lived that I got a good room rate, I understood that there were resort fees. I liked that there was online check-in. Here's the WARNING - don't accept the $25 early check-in. It's says they will notify you when the room is ready before you get there. I did not receive a notification. When I arrived at 2p I went to the desk and was told they had a room available. I asked if I was going to be charged for the early check-in from online and the guy said no. On checkout, it is on my bill. I called, explained and Javier said that's the way it is because I got the room before 4pm. No discussion, that's the rules. For $25 I won't be back here. Venetian is way better with guest services and a much fresher hotel."
1,"The food and service was excellent! The waitor recommended the crispy duck in pagnang curry and the seabass and drunken noodle and both were excellent. The restaurant is in a small strip mall that's a bit shady. And, we waited about 10 minutes to be able to hail a cab back to the strip. I'd go back again for the food when in Vegas."
0,"It was the worst dinner I had we went with a group we had the worst service . The manager very impolite , agressive they don t have what in z menu and no excuses their answer we didn t do it today . Not flexible to accomadate clients . Well it was a good one before but since they sell it became very bad and prices very high .. Never going again ."
0,"I felt that this place was overpriced for less than average Indian food. What sets this place apart the most is the absolutely horrible service. I tried it three times. I try to always do that if I feel that there might be something I miss on the first or second time at a restaurant. I kept hoping maybe it was a single server...then two...when it hit three separate poor servers, I was done. The food is merely okay for the price paid-the service ensures I won't return. Long waits at the door (with open tables visible), attitude and exceptionally long waits for orders placed are why I give it 1 star. In addition, it's like a cave inside."
1,"Wow! Words alone will not be able to explain the depth of deliciousness that encompassed this meal. Rather than try I'll state simply that you must eat here. Perfect!! We had a party of 8 and enjoyed a variety of items such as: carpaccio, linguine with clams, lamb osso bucco, veal piccata, chicken parm, and much more. A great variety (no two people ordered the same dish). Celebrated a birthday and they took great care of us at Trevi. Thanks!"
1,"So, overall, the food here I've had has been really good. I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.\n\nThey always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley."
0,Went to the store to order a deep dish pizza with pepperoni/sausage on one side and ham/pineapple on the other side. The guy kept getting the order wrong and I had to correct him two times and finally someone came over to help. When I got home I found that they sliced the pizza into 16 slices with each one being less than 2 inches wide. Pizza tasted good but I will not be using this location again.
1,"The food and beer all taste OK. Nothing mindblasting. About 3 stars. Why did I give it an additional 2 stars? The entertainment! It's a cool place to bring out of town guests and have a blast. It's also a cool place to bring your significant other if they've been bad. Trick them into thinking they can have all this beer and once they are woozy you can trick them into getting a Yager shot/Paddle spanking! Haha, it was hilarious watching all these men getting paddled by the waitresses. There was yelping left and right and some guys even went for seconds! We convinced our guys to get a group spanking and one of them still had an imprint the next day! Haha awesome!"
1,Had a pizza craving tonight but was too lazy to get in my car since my favorite pizza joint does not deliver.  So -- I went online and ordered from Joe's NY Pizza.  I wasn't sure if they would deliver since we are 7 miles away from the nearest location BUT I was excited when the order went through!  We ordered the Gourmet Pepperoni - award winning! and the Manhattan Loaded!  Both were extremely tasty!
1,"For beer connoisseurs, this is the place to go to. Every week they have different beers and usually over 20 beers on tap every night. They also have alot of hard to get beers in bottles. Best of all the have a cask beer that they open every friday. I have been to the bar more that 10 times and everytime I come there is a different list to choose from. I do not think I have had the same beer tqice at the bar.\nThe bar looks more like an old fashioned bar without tvs. At night the bar is rather dimly lit, but still a great ambiance. The most surprising thing, is that many of the beers are priced around 4 to 5 dollars which most bars would charge 6 dollars for. Being from CA I am happy to see alot of Stone brewery beers which are extremly tasty. Many of the customers are young people who are in grad school or are working, with the atmosphere really laid back."
1,"I'm shocked there aren't more reviews of Primp and Blow's new location at the Waterfront. Since the hype started with these dry bar locations, I have been itching to give one a try, but the others in the Valley were far from where I lived so I hadn't been. However, I was walking through the Waterfront a couple months ago and smiled with delight in learning one was coming to the Waterfront! \n\nThis is an excellent location for this type of service. Think about you. You're shopping for a night out on the town or a special occasion, it's late in the afternoon and you have to start thinking about going home and getting ready. Why not just have the pros get you ready instead! That's what I did at least. I would probably only come here when I need to get ready for a special occasion since it is a little pricey for the service, but it's a great atmosphere and gives you a chance to relax and get primped (literally!) When I came here, I did the blow dry service and makeup. I believe my hair dresser's name was Abby and she was a total sweetheart! I got an extensive wash w/ massage followed by a blow dry and style. Here's a sweet piece of info I learned. If you come with your hair already washed, they'll curl it for I think around $15. They have an extensive list of options and services but I'll get to that in a sec. Following my hair-do, we moved over to the makeup station where she did my makeup like a pro! I felt great after my primping and ready to go home, put on my dress and go! How simple is that! Again, it's a little pricey but it's worth it for the right occasion! \n\nFor the services, like I said, they offer a variety. They offer waxing, spray tan, hair and makeup (I could be missing some). The pricing is comparable to the other dry bars and I love the look of Primp and Blow! It's girly and modern and would be a great spot to have a girls day of primping (maybe a bachelorette party?) I will absolutely be back!"
1,"AWESOME!  Thanks for coming through for me in a pinch.  Great service and communication.  I will definitely use again and refer, refer, refer."
0,The food is not that good. Nor is the sangria. Firefly has this place beat I'm sorry to say. Good try guys but up your game.
0,Just got my car washed today. Didn't notice till i got home what a horrible job it was! And to think i had given $5 extra for tip. I felt like  my car got in the rain and dried up. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I dont think ill come back to this one ever again. Very bad service. POOR QUALITY JOB DONE.
0,"I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. \nThe best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. \n \n I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.  Not sure if I'd come back."
1,"Such an awesome show. So much fun to be had. The music is great, the dancing is outstanding and the comedy is top rate."
1,"Came here for HH on a Sunday with friends. Sat in the bar area. Our server \""Amir\"" was very pleasant and nice. He was very attentive and friendly. Enjoyed our food and drinks . The Sangrias were pretty weak though haha. Other than that I would def return again."
0,"after purchasing a groupon online i scheduled an appointment to get my photo-shoot, and day of I could not make it and Adam was very rude and told me that I was basically out the money payed for the shoot, very unprofessional and I would choose someone with more class."
1,"Funny to write this and read the review below mine about Tuyen N's brother ridign a motorcycle. \n\nThis is the only hospital I really like. I would say the comparison between this and Good Sam is night and day. By contrast, Good Sam is gross. It feels shabby, and the people are unfriendly.\n\nI've been to the ER at St. Joseph's twice. The first time was for a motorcycle accident. I was fine after the wreck but my shoulder kind of fell out of it's socket so I had to go. I was being seen by a doctor within 20 minutes of walking in on my own strength. The doctor was very nice and the nursing staff was great. Everyone joked with me and made me feel really comfortable. Riding a stretcher in a neck brace and wanting to look around on the way is impossible, BTW, just incase you want to try it cant be done.\n\nMy second visit was for a more severe thing. I had food poisoning from YC's Mongolian BBQ (read my review on that place) and shit/threw up so much that I became severely dehydrated. I couldn't walk on my own and while at Urgent Care they couldn't get an IV in me due in part to their own retardation. Well again, I was called back almost immediately at St. Joe's. They told me their ER is new and is designed to handle MANY more patients than the other hospitals and it shows. I got a total hottie doctor there! She wasn't interested in a guy who was in my state though... I was gross that day. The entire staff is made up of young, attractive, go getters. Not like Good Sam which is old, fat people who work in a gross hospital. \n\nSt. Joe's for me. I've told my girl that if I have a major emergency ever, to make sure I am taken there."
1,this place is amazing try the fried mushrooms and wings with ranch and be blown away..........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"What a disappointment tonight was, in the last three months, we have been to \""Al's Beef\"" at least 15 times, according to my punched card, with tonight new card has 6. Being a 30 year native of Chicago,  we just got back from a 2 week stay, we wanted to enjoy that beefy taste, and boy were we surprised,  8/15/2014 ticket # 127 at 4:27pm. We ordered a Big Al's Beef dipped w/peppers (cut in half), sml fries and soda. Got our order, opened it up and, What a disappointment,  the sandwich was at least 1/3 smaller than all our previous visit and dry/dry for dipped?. I took this matter up with John (Mgr) he claims that shipment of buns received were smaller than normal, than after bout 5 minutes,  he came to our table to say \""sorry\"" again and gave us a token chip for a free fries on next visit. I wasn't after to resolve issue today on my next visit, I also don't believe a business should start cutting portion size to make higher profits, now that they have me on a customers repetitive purchasing plan, I had believed that for the $8 charged for portion size was good before.  Don't think we'll go back there, and after we sent 4 different families there to enjoy as we had!!!"
0,Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere
1,"Great little family owned place.  A good portion of the client\u00e8le is actually Middle Eastern, so they've got to be doing something right.  The owner, Mike, is always around and very friendly, and usually hanging out in the market part of the building.  There's a hookah bar upstairs, but having an aversion to hookah, I've never ventured in.   The market is neat to look around in and a good place to go for some excellent fresh feta cheese or lamb.\n\nOn to the food.. it is fantastic and inexpensive.  You can get a falafel sandwich and fries for under $5, but that's about the cheapest meal on the menu.  The have a lunch buffet Monday - Friday from 11-3 for $10.  It's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus.  About 75% of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating, but I always enjoy it.\n\nAs an added bonus, the last time I was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t-shirts with kittens on it.. their faces on the front, and their butts on the back.  I don't know if he was serious or not, but it was pretty amazing."
1,LOVE Port of Subs!  My favorite sub chain.  I just wish they were more conveniently located.
1,"Great store I love the service;  everyone knows my name & is extraordinarily helpful..\n\n.Barb, Sharon, Tammy all help me each week & Tammy made me laugh the whole weekend w/her adorable cap in the Seasonal Isle.  I would love to share the pix but no capability here;  however I posted it to my Facebook site.\n\nOne of the prettiest stores in the valley.....love to shop there!!!"
0,"Why I hated this restaurant.  I' m allowed one rant a year and this will be mine.  This is the most uppity, insincere restaurant experience you're likely to have.  Yes the atmosphere is over the top faux Italian and the waiters all wear expensive looking tuxedos but leave the attitude at your next failed acting audition.  Our set of waiters were so arrogant, smug and lacking in warmth.  An Italian night out should be about warmth, appreciation of the customer and genuine food.\n\nOur main waiter made us feel cheap or lacking in taste every time a person didn't want an appetizer or wanted to split a dessert or was going to pass on that $40 glass of grappa.  Here's an excellent example.  I asked for the second cheapest bottle of wine on the menu--Chianti Classico for $80 a bottle.  Yeah it offends me that I can buy the same bottle for $12.  The waiter said, \""You'll really prefer the Riserva.\""  \""oh, how much is that?\""  \""It's $300\"".   Well, thanks for the offer of letting me pay $300 for a $25/bottle of wine but I'll just plug my nose and drink that over-priced $80 bottle of banal Chianti.\n\nOk, the food is good--no question about it--but not outstanding.  I thought the cotoletta milanese was good and my wife enjoyed her simple papparadelle a pomodoro.  They made a grand production of the Limoncello and that was both fun and tasty.  Here's my humble conclusion.  Unless you are prepared to spend $200/person, expect to be treated like you're Jed Clampett on the Beverly Hills Hillbillies--coming from a waiter who probably earns 20% of what you do.  It simply wasn't a fun, edifying evening out.  Che peccato that we didn't go back to Parma which I gave 5 stars.\n\n3 adults and 3 kids, one bottle of cheap wine, 2 appetizers, no dessert, 3 glasses of limoncello = $640"
1,"Well, that was delicious. The Don, I think it was, with chicken, marinara and no green peppers. Sheesh! I just ate it 6 hours ago and I want another right now."
1,"\""Lounge\"" is exactly right.  Tutto's is true to it's name and one of the most fun places I've been to in Charlotte for getting a drink and hearing some new music.  Don't expect a true dance club.  It's a modern lounge with great drinks, a very full bar and nice decor - basically it's a bar with a cozy atmosphere after 10pm.\n\nThe music is up to date, not too loud early in the evening but gets quite loud later on.  There's no dance floor, it's just open space, so you can dance if you want to but most are there to be in a cool, edgy environment, looking nice and enjoying time with friends and meeting new people.  It definitely gets clubbier later in the evening after 11pm.  And it can get ridiculously loud very quickly towards midnight which his a shame because music this good doesn't need to be ear-splitting.  One star deduction because there's no designated dance area.\n\nAs with any \""clubbish\"" atmosphere there are douchebags and idiots galore but just go there with your crew, see if you like the music and do your thing. The cool kids become pretty obvious and you know who to hang with and who to avoid.  The bouncers here are serious too, which is a good thing, so behave."
1,"Love the atmosphere here.  Cozy and chic.  I had the Spring Vegetable salad on my first (and only so far) visit and loved it.  Great visit overall.  Food is a tad pricey, which is expected with location."
0,Warning do not move into this place!!! Very unprofessional and always changing staff! Will charge you for everything they can! I would never live in any of the ovation properties again!
1,"You will love the pizza here, unless you're some sort of east coast pizza snob that thinks all pizza should be the same.  The toppings are very high quality, and the crust is awesome.  They have very creative and different styles of pizza, so you have to keep an open mind.  I'd highly recommend the Egg & Pancetta, Buffalo Chicken, or the Yukon Gold Hot Potato Pie pizzas.  While you're there, grab a pint of the Papago Breweries Orange Blossom Wheat Beer, you will not be disappointed!"
1,"Recently Else's menu has changed for the better. The food is out of this world, and I'm actually craving those spicy shrimps. The price is unbeatable and the drinks are great (great drink specials too).\nIt's the best to be for good food, great conversation and atmosphere."
0,If I could put zero I would. I've been coming here since it opened and it has went down hill for sure. Drinks are half azs and service is just as bad. At least nights are terrible. \nIf you are looking for a place to play and get a drink I would recommend to look at other bars. The night shift bartender does not take care of the players but he does take care of his friends that hang out there. My drink taste fine but alittle warm for it being wine. I promise one thing as long as the bartender I had tonight is there we will not be going back. So many other choices in this town than a place that caters to bartenders friends and not people that can bring this place other paying customers!!
1,On our way to Sedona we found this little restaurant. We sat there concern with the cleanliness  of the place. There were noodles on the floor from previous costumers and the service started a little slow. I ordered chicken Pad thai. When the dish finally came it looked fresh. Wow! This is the best pad thai i have ever had outside of thailand. The most authentic i have had so far. The food was so good that i forgot the messy floors.
0,Like other posts...you get what you pay for...best part was the beer.  Prayed i wouldn't get food poisoning.
1,"I freaking love this place! A friend of mine decided to meet here for dinner, since i wanted to try something different. She suggested this place since she knew this was good.\n\nAnd I must say ... Good indeed..\n\nWe ordered the salt and pepper calamari, which was really good, had no tentacles which I love! I usually dont eat the tentacles anyways.\n\nNext we also ordered the Rib Eye Bao burger which is TO DIE FOR! NO JOKE! I love it I love it! if You guys are ever in Wendy's make sure you guys order this..\n\nNext we also ordered the Shanghai dumplings which is to die for as well. I suggest you order this too..\n\nThen finally decided to try the Kimchie rice cakes. Was not a fan but it was different.. Im use to having rice cake as a dessert not as a entree. \n\nOverall the service was great. This is located in front of the 168 supermarket.\n\nTry now, you'll love it."
0,"Einfach l\u00e4cherlich: das Lokal sperrt um 22:30 (oder bessre gesagt es l\u00e4\u00dft keinen mehr rein) . Wir kamen um genau 22:31 (lt. iPhone am Welcome Desk) und man erkl\u00e4rte uns, dass geschlossen sei. Drinnen war aber noch richtig viel los. Ich fragte eigentlich recht h\u00f6flich nach, warum man wegen einer Minute einen Aufstand macht. Daraufhin kam dann der Supervisor und meinte \""That is the rule, I am so sorry !\"" Ich w\u00fcrde es verstehen, wenn wirklich nichts mehr los ist allerdings es waren um die Uhrzeit eigentlich nur ein paar Tische frei und die Kellner haben noch Bestellungen aufgenommen. Na klar, von den Leuten die um 22:29 gekommen sind ;-)\nSowas ist einfach l\u00e4cherlich, \u00e4rgerlich, unsympathisch und \u00fcberhaupt nicht verst\u00e4ndlich !"
0,"I first experienced Ian's at the Chicago location.  Now granted the alcohol may have created a biased opinion, but after realizing there was an Ian's in Madison, I was immediately enthused.  The idea of putting delicious dishes onto pizza which is almost always delicious in and of itself is mind boggling for sure.\n\nUpon our arrival, we ordered 4 differnt slices to share and sample.  We took our treasures nearby lakeside to watch the sunset over bbq chicken, pesto alfredo, philly cheesesteak, and some other flavor I can't recall.  If it weren't for the scenery, the whole experience was wholly disappointing.  All four flavors were lacking in well, flavor.  The bbq chicken was the only decent of the four and the pesto was a far second.  Overall, it was quite the disappointment.\n\nI don't recommend eating at Ian's unless you've had a few, but I do encourage you to stray half a mile near the school's campus to partake in the live music and summer scene."
1,"Full disclosure - I am the epitome of low-maintenance when it comes to beauty treatments.  I'm a Midwesterner, I get my hair cut at chains, use Suave shampoo, and never met drugstore eyeliner than I didn't like.  We don't so much do opulent self-care, here.  I had NEVER BEEN to a spa, and NEVER HAD a professional massage until our Las Vegas vacation stay at the Wynn/Encore.  So, yeah, I'm easily impressed, but, still...my SO and I received, as a gift, a 90-minute \""couples massage\"" at the Spa at Encore, and the included full use of the spa amenities before and after.  Talk about a crash course in pampering.  \n\nMy one regret is that the massage package was booked at the beginning of our trip, the afternoon after we flew in, and while it was awesome to have all the airline/airport kinks worked out, I might have opted to do it at the end of our trip as an awesome sendoff.  I felt like I undid all the effects with the following days of roaming around Vegas. That said, absolutely no complaints.  \n\nThe staff was EXTREMELY nice to a spa newbie, explaining how things worked without being bitchy or condescending or patronizing, and we got a great pre-massage tour of the facilities, detailing all the amenities, which were many.  Beautiful decor, beyond relaxing atmosphere, and such a great variety of ways to get your chill on.  SO and I were taken off separately to the guys and girls' ends of the faciltiies to relax for about a half-hour (friend who made the appointment made sure to tell us to get there early to take advantage of all the amenities, which we'd not have known).  Lounging about on heated stone chaise longues, eating honeyed apricots and drinking tea, reading magazines was a great prelude to the massage itself.  Afterward, I stayed for another hour or so using the sauna, jacuzzi, and waterfall showers to my heart's content.  \n\nSO is NOT the posterchild for \""guy who wants a massage.\""  He's rather a touch-me-not, actually, so while he politely accepted the gift, I had my doubts that he'd actually enjoy it, but he was easily won over, to my surprise.  Back home in the heartland, I don't have much hope of replicating the Encore spa-like experience, but oh, well.  Reason to go back."
0,"Unacceptable.\n\nBecause of their service, some of our friends had to REORDER our baby shower gifts that were somehow lost or returned to vendors. Do you know how bad that makes us feel??\n\nWhat's equally infuriating is that the customer service lady claimed that a delivery attempt had been made that morning. Hello, I was home ALL morning and no one showed up?!  Then she went on to assert that the driver could not locate our address. That makes no sense; we have been receiving numerous packages from UPS and Fedex all this while.\n\nSUM: Go with FEDEX...though unfortunately when ordering from certain vendors (e.g., Amazon, as in Dan C and my experience), you don't get to specify the carrier..."
0,"No options for egg free hamburger bun!  Was told by the manager that all of the buns contain egg, so my son was unable to order a burger.  We opted to not eat here as a family, since they were unable to accommodate him.  Sad that restaurants are not willing to take allergens into consideration when creating the menu and offer options."
0,Check them out on Ch 5's Dirty Dining 11/7/13. You be the judge.
1,"The food made my mouth water like the Niagra Falls. The service was great!! I ordered half of their menu one time, and like a wild vulture from the African Plains, I devoured it all! After a while I took a 3pound crap at work and the bathroom was off limits  for  awhile. All in all, it was worth the brown volcano. Come here and try out all their great selections!!! This place is great!"
0,"I have been to this school a few times to take tests and they way they do things is very old fashion I must say for Vegas. Computers I thought were taking over the world? Well I hope so since that is where my career lies.\n\nSo you do your paperwork at the front which is filled with young adults that don't really know what they are doing. They sit there and ask each other for help. I don't know what that is all about. Do they get paid or this is for credits? \n\nThey make you fill out paperwork and then send you over to the cashier. The cashier knows what they are doing at least. Then the cashier gives you a piece of paper, saying you paid for your test and then you walk back over to the front desk to show them the piece of paper. Is anyone following how time consuming and old fashion this is? \n\nOk so I move to a different address. I know I have to be there early so I can change my address before my test. I give proof of address with a bill in hand but they say I don't need that. So then I give my I.D. to them which also has my new address on it. He takes it and goes scans it, I guess to put it in my file. They make me filled out new paperwork. Then once that is all done I head to the testing room, and even tell the teacher I have a new address. She writes it down. On my test, it asks if I had any changes since my last test, and there's a option for new address. I check it. I even filled it out on the test. Now I am pretty confident my results will get to my new address.\n\nOne month later, I still haven't gotten my results in the mail yet. I was patient enough and decided to call to see what was going on. The young male adult that answered the phone kept putting me on hold to look for my test and when I took it. \n\nSo he finds my paperwork and starts reading off my old address. I started laughing in frustration. I explained what I went through, that morning to make sure everything was going to be sent to me. I wasn't mean or nasty with him.  laughed a lot thought because I couldn't believe this was happening. I asked if he could changed it over the phone and that was of course no. I must go back to the school and change my address and also get my test results there too. \n\nSo my scanning of my I.D. was missing, and all the new sheets I filled out were just gone? He also tells me that he would of remember scanning my I.D. because he was there that day of the test. \n\nI hung up on him. I couldn't take it anymore. He made me look like I was lying. How frustrating is that. \n\nSo I am still in the unknown about my results. I haven't been able to make it down to the school since I don't have a car. It's really not easy to get to in my situation. \n\nI am finding another school quickly. Will not give them anymore of my money!!  \n\nThanks CSN for all the drama."
1,"Oil changes aren't glamorous but at least here they make it a pretty painless task . I'm not a girly girl but I don't do the mechanics/car stuff so it's nice to get a simple oil change without being told my doors will surely blow off in a matter of days or my engine has a fungus growth on it. They're to the point, tell you nicely about things you might want to look into and send you on your way. \n\nMy car and I are now regulars here (I know, VIP Jiffy Lube status, don't be jels) so I have to say now the service is even better. They store the info from your last visit so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you come. I also got my smog done here and that was quick and easy as well. The guy even told me there was a nearby DMV registration kiosk where it spits your stickers out for you! Bonus! The fastest service, I've found, is right around 4:30pm on weekdays, if you can make that happen.\n\nThe waiting room is clean, they always have on some sort of super hero movie, they must come from someone's home collection. So far I've seen glimpses of Spiderman, Thor and maybe a Batman in there somewhere. I just play on my phone or Kindle so doesn't really concern me. Sadly no wifi, I've heard other Jiffy Lubes have that feature. They also have coffee and a restroom. \n\nOverall, good service and friendly peeps. You and your car will be happy."
1,"Thirsty on thursday, with a wad of cash in my pocket, and indebted to my brother for several rounds of drinks he bought me earlier in the week we set off on our bikes down 3rd ave. on a righteous quest that could rival Bill and Ted's any day.\nRiding along my neighborhood in the pleasant evening air, I knew my destination well in advance. \n\""where are we going man??\"" asks my Sancho Panza-esque little brother.\n\""To a land of giants weilding wooden lances, and green felt tables, where ivory like orbs are ricocheted against one another, and ales flow from spigates for mere pence on the dollar. We go my dear boy to a house that is hidden. aye. a hidden house\""\n\""what the hell are you talking about man!?\""\n\""onward rocinante!\"" i said as i pedaled my fixed gear with all the might my legs could muster. shrugging his shoulders my younger brother kept up the pace on his tank like classic cruiser.\nAs we approached Osborn we wound our way to the Hidden House's parking lot and whipped our steeds over to the bicycle lockup. The outside trappings didnt show much promise, and my doubts started to arise within me. Justin was quite aloof to this however, and locked our bikes up promptly and waltzed on in, I followed hesitantly. \nThe minute we stepped foot inside I felt at ease, the relaxed patrons all sat quite quietly, humbly watching their football games, college and pro.\nWe belly'd up to the bar and I ordered a scotch and soda for myself and a pbr for justin. \nAmazedly we stared at the plethora of billiards tables offered to us, and after several rounds of bevvy, and a failed inquiry as to what food they offered (the kitchen is closed until further notice), we made straight away for a rousing game of pool. \nWe neither of us could best one another so the true test of our mettle at billiards will have to come later. 2 to 2, $1 for four games of pool, is probably the best deal I have ever come across.\nWe left the Hidden House in a blurry stupor, but we left as champions, conquerors of windmills and tins of beer. The ride home not withstanding several scrapes and bruises."
1,"I'm not a brunch type of person because I'd rather save my appetite for lunch or dinner. However some of my friends are brunch type people and the last 2 visits to Las Vegas I went here to eat with them. Sometimes I surprise myself for being able to wake up on time for a meal this early in Las Vegas. Might be tricky to find but it's below lobby level of The Venetian.\n\nThe food here is very good, and the selection of different type of brunch food and pastries is big. Both times that I've been here, we had to order the foie gras spread. So delicious! Corned Beef Hash was what I had and the portions are very big. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and knew the menu very well."
0,"I only came here because my friend wanted to get a sandwich. It seems like a simple concept to mark what you want and how, with very specific choices.  \nI ordered chicken- got turkey\nI ordered sliced egg- got no sliced egg\nI ordered spinach- shred lettuce only\nI ordered honey mustard-got ranch\n\nReally?  It seems like the likelihood of getting it wrong would lower. \n\nGood ingredients, pretty clean, average drink selection, and average chip selection. Yay bathrooms!"
0,"I'm prefacing this with the following items:\n1) This review is only about the cupcakes\n2) This review is only about the store on Craig St.\n\nI don't get it.  People just ooh and ahh about these cupcakes.  Twice I've gone to their store around 2-3pm for a cupcake.  By then, they're \""sold out\"" of most of the options.  You're open till the evening and sell out at 2pm?  Really?\n\nI've had four cupcakes from here....four separate occasions...four different flavors.  For the price, you'd think it would at least be moist.  Plan on having a glass of milk with these bad boys because it's a mouth-drying experience.  \n\nI give up.  Go next door to starbucks and get a muffin.  It will be cheaper, more moist, and you'll enjoy it more.  I promise."
1,"Came here with our Groupon deal for dinner and am glad we decided to check this place out. Unlike the other reviews, we didn't get any trouble making reservations with our Groupon deal. You definitely couldn't tell this was a nice, well decorated French restaurant from the outside appearance due to its location next to a laundromat and Japanese supermarket. However, once you enter the restaurant, it's amazing inside especially with the open kitchen. Our server was very polite and she nicely answered any questions we had. We started off with the beef tenderloin tartare. It was my first time trying it and it was actually delicious. I ordered the pork chops while my bf ordered one of the specials, the coq au vin (chicken cooked with wine). All I gotta say was the sauce the pork chops came in was delicious!! I would have finished the whole plate if I could, but there was so much! My pork chops were also cooked perfectly. The coq au vin was also good, but I definitely enjoyed the pork chops more. :) The food portions were very generous, which is a plus."
1,The shredded beef burrito and lunch fajitas are really good. A great place to eat lunch.
1,"Great place for lunches, great laid back bar, two for one bar food on Tuesday, I especially like the jerk chicken piaza at the bar (dough and all made from scratch). and actually it offers quite a nice regular menu and great desserts. The chocolate creme brule is the best.  Most of the food is made from scratch, kind of has a high end Disney restaurant food feel to it.  The atmosphere is eclectic and warm, the staff is great, but you have to push a little if you are on a luch hour. I will go again and again.  :)M"
1,"Yes, the Wynn is expensive. If you're going to eat in any of the cafes and restaurants here you just have to accept it. And if you're exhausted from a night of gambling you probably won't have the energy to wander very far for a bite to eat in the morning. But that being said, I felt like I *almost* got my money's worth with the veggie breakfast bagel. It was huge! There must have been around 4 egg whites in there. It was a tad bland since it was basically poached egg whites with a bit of spinach, but it was fine with a touch of salt, and totally filling. They also have a sausage or bacon breakfast bagel if you're so inclined. \n\nAt $8ish it was a good deal for a simple, quick breakfast compared to the Terrace Pointe Cafe which had more elaborate breakfast choices for double the price. If you can wait until 10 am, Sugar & Ice (towards the end of the shopping esplanade) also has some cheaper breakfast options, though I didn't have the chance to try any of them."
0,"I was expecting an experience to BW3s, but that is not what I got. \n\nThe Parmesan garlic wings do not have sauce on them, but are instead soaked in butter with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over top. Totally disgusting.  Their menu doesn't even mention that it isn't a sauce. \n\nThe fries also have a weird sugary sweet kind of thing going on. They weren't very good.\n\nI couldn't get through more than a few bites of each.\n\nIt's possible that the wings that actually have sauce (though the menu doesn't point out which those are) might be better, but I will never know...\n\nI won't ever be back."
0,"I would like to preface my review by saying that I didn't actually eat here. I bailed before ordering...I was that disappointed when I walked up. I walked up and got in line, then looked around to make sure I was at the right place, it was that bad. I am pretty sure they decided to call this place the Burger Palace because someone lost a bet. A better name would have been the \""Snack Bar\"" as in the exact same place I see at Little League games at home. One would think being the \""Palace\"" of anything would generally infer that you have some sort of specialty, usually having to do with you being the \""Palace\"" of that particular item....Well not here. You walk up and are greeted by a cafeteria type corral to line up in...The menu had Three burgers I think? (Plain, Cheese and Chili burger) then other offerings like fries, chips, grilled cheese ect. I kept searching the menu for a sign I was indeed at the \""Burger Palace\"" but couldn't find anything. I looked over the patrons eating their \""Palace\"" offerings and, if I hadn't been cooped up in a casino, would have thought they all had $.99 burgers from the local Jack in the Crack. Nothing I was about to pay $6 for...See Ya...Ill go loose my money on the slots...They seemed to be a better option that the Palace. Sorry Folks!"
1,"It is all Nora V.'s fault that I had to come order from this place!  =)  So after shopping at Target, I had to come get my Asian on!  LOL!\n\nI walked in and placed an order to go:\n1.  BBQ Pork - This is from the apps selection:  the bbq sauce to too sweet for my liking\n2.  Sesame Chicken - I liked their version, but the chicken could be crispier but then again I got it togo so it was steaming in the container\n3.  Beef Chow Fun - This is a good flavorful dish but the chow fun was made with thin flat noodles not the normal flat wide noodles.  Either way, it is was good."
0,We ordered through a delivery service to have delivered to our office. The chocolate malted crunch was stale and old. So disappointed since I love going here. Wasted money on this delivery!
0,"I have been to several wine and canvas events in various locations around the valley. Some better than others but I enjoyed them all, obviously, I keep coming back. The classes vary based on venue, instructor, crowd etc. Some locations put us in a room that is too cramped, sometimes patrons have to walk through a smoke filled bar to get to the \""classroom\"" and sometimes the business hosting the class simply isn't ready for the increased demand on servers and bar staff. ALL of the snafus I've experienced can't hold a candle to the poor set-up at the actual Wine and Canvas Studio. \n\nI can understand that lots of bars and restaurants aren't designing their business model around hosting painting classes. There is going to be an occasional hiccup. I don't understand why a studio with the SOLE PURPOSE of hosting wine and canvas classes falls so short in it's offerings to patrons. \n\nThe maximum occupancy of this place is 127 and they offer one restroom. I don't mean one restroom per gender but one restroom period. I don't know the exact count but I estimate 60+ people the night I was there. The majority were overwhelmingly female, many were drinking and they have one toilet. I was drinking. I had a designated driver and I needed to use the restroom without missing a portion of the class. At one point the line was 3 people deep and the instructor was still teaching. Intermission please.\n\nNext stop, the service or lack thereof. There is a corner \""bar\"" which consists of a counter top, cash register and beverage cooler. Participants have to stand in line and order drinks. There is no waitstaff. Between standing in line for the restroom and going to the \""bar\"" to purchase my own drinks, I'm not sure when I had the time to finish my painting. While the drink prices were relatively reasonable, the selection was slim and the few beers they did offer ran out before the class was over. Two thirds of the way through class I went to get a round for Jessica C., myself and our +1 only to be told that they still had the pumpkin blue moon but were out of regular. \n\nI will probably attend another wine and canvas class in the future. I'll go to a cool little tavern, a cheesy dive bar or a hip new restaurant. I will not, however, be going back to the studio. IMO the studio is a fail. For the same price I can go to a venue with a full service restaurant/bar menu, enjoy being waited on while I paint and not have to time my bathroom trips around everyone else."
0,The past office itself is okay but some of the employees there are morons. I hate having to interact with them.  Why after 6 years would you ask a regular customer whom you know by name for id and make you sign back of your cc? It makes no sense and is irritating.
0,What a crap airport.  The airport security line is always backed up and they take forever to get your ticket scanned.  Hire more employees.
0,"Went to the relatively new Buca Di Beppo at the mall for lunch. I had been to one several years ago in Indianapolis and remember thinking it was pretty good but a tad expensive for what you got.\n\nWe were greeted promptly and seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and made us feel at home. Unfortunately, we were seated at a table that seemed to be right in the traffic flow in and out of the restaurant. That made everything feel just a little busy.\n\nI can't say that I was impressed with the decor. Lots of pictures that appeared to feature Italian individuals and families were throughout the interior, but since this is a chain restaurant, they obviously lacked the charm that could have been there if they weren't stock pictures but a real family history.\n\nThe 1893 Salad we ate was okay. The complementary bread was rather tasteless and the oil and balsamic vinegar used for dipping was fair. I thought I had seen individual lunch combinations on the Buca online menu, but the menu we were given did not list any lunch combos unless we somehow missed them. Without the lunch combos, two people eating a lunch of garlic bread, salad, pasta for two and a soft drink plus tax and tip would be paying almost $50. There is an internet coupon for a $40 meal for four people, which seems reasonable. Without the lunch combos, two people would have to pay quite a bit for a simple lunch.\n\nBased on our trip today, I would be in no hurry to return. There are several Italian restaurants in the C-U area, both family owned and chain, that I would rather visit."
0,"I used to live right up the street from this restaurant and as a result came here several times.  I don't think that there is any way I'd return though.  I have literally never felt good after eating here - whether it was a hazy, late night encounter and getting sick in the morning, or more of a standard evening dinner and getting sick at night.  Maybe I'm allergic to some sort of special, exclusive ingredient they use..."
0,"\""I'm sorry you feel that way\"" is often used to dismiss a woman's opinion or thought. It's an attempt to silence her. So not only does your sushi suck you try to silence  your customers that are taking their time to provide constructive criticism in a form of a review.\n\nThe sushi that I had was not fresh. Others have reviewed that their sushi was NOT fresh. If multiple people are saying your seafood is not fresh then it is not fresh. \n\nI was born in and spent a lot of my life in a fishing village off the Mediterranean Sea with a family full of fishermen. I also served in the United States Coast Guard and served in Boston and and more than aware of the seafood coming from there and how it should look like. I am more than qualified to know what fresh seafood is and what is not. I am also qualified to know what is real seafood and what is not. Imitation crab meat is NOT real seafood.\n\nI even took into consideration and lowered my standards a bit cause we are--after all in the desert.  Your sushi was not even \""fresh for Arizona\""."
0,"This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area."
1,I am originally from Hawaii where you can get a tan just walking to your car. I have never gone indoor tanning before and I didn't know where to go or who to trust when I moved out here to Las Vegas. Thankfully I stumbled upon Elite Tanning. They made my very first  tanning experience the best! The staff is very friendly and helpful and the facility is very clean. I am now a huge fan of indoor tanning and continue to go here. I Highly recommend this place!
0,"Stopped on my way home for pizza and a Greek salad.  This is by far not the pizza I'm used to being from NY!!!  It tastes like a frozen pizza but my husband says the dough old.  I asked for it well done because pizza here in AZ tends to be doughy, it wasn't well done....nor sure if i should give it a second chance ir just never return?  this place needs A LOT of work!"
0,"I have been to Lucky Strikes a couple times, it is located on the second floor of Cityscape in downtown Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, last time I came with a serious beast-like hunger and I had every intention  of shamelessly stuffing my face with lots of delicious bar food as soon as I sat down. I  ordered the nachos and the mini bacon cheese burgers. Lets just say both dishes were mundane and anticlimactic at best. The nachos left me extremely unsatisfied and wanting to run to Filberto's on my way home! \nOn a more positive note, the place looks very cool, modern trendy and pretty large.  It does seem good for parties and bigger groups. If bowling is your thing, I'd say this place is worth checking out but don't come for the food. just saying."
0,"Not my style at all.  Most of the sushi was below average and wasn't that fresh.  I guess I'm a food snob, but I will get fresh rolled sushi where I know its fresh."
0,"The quality has dropped from our last 2 visits, shrimp were old and mushy. What a shame I really enjoyed this place."
1,It was great. I highly recommend it. Especially garlic butter and filet mignon are perfect.
1,"I am from Spain and I am a foodie.   This place rocks.  Six stars out of five.  Better than sex (almost).  I would write details, but I gotta get back to the food."
1,"Some of the best sushi I've had. Both of us enjoyed it. The fried rice had pineapple, which was different but surprisingly delicious. The prices at first seemed a bit high, then we found the happy hour menu and were very happy with the prices, especially with the quality."
1,"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said already? It's VERY hot food. They do have options that aren't as hot, but they don't sound as good. I have finally found a dish that I can eat which is the bean burro. That might sound funny but it's perfectly seasoned whole beans (just like my Suegra used to make).  The tortilla is soft, fresh, warm. It is a perfect specimen of a bean burro. \n\nI might mention, I'm happy I found something I can eat there, because I do love their Coronarita to drink. It really should be called \""the tranquilizer\""."
0,"I've been to Villas four times since it opened.  Since its right across the street from my house, I really wanted to like it.  I was excited to see a Mexican place opening so close other than El Gran Taquito. \n\nEvery time I've gone there, service has been slow.   Two times we have gone and a part of our order has been forgotten.  Today I went and ordered a single item, a bean burrito, and they didn't even START making it for 25 minutes (the window allows you to see them cooking).  For what is supposed to be convenience food, the service is just not there.  The food is average, but after factoring in the wait time, I don't think I'll go back.\n\nI've had fairly good luck with Vaquero's (southern and 19th Ave), although it is a bit further from Laveen."
1,"One of my top-five places to eat in town (I know, I'm a cheap date).  Their toasted subs are fresh, fast and amazingly good.   What is it that makes this place so delicious?  I dunno, it just is.  Mention Cheba Hut to any one who has tasted it before and watch their eyes light up.  It's just that good.\n\nSeveral premium choices for vegetarians.  My weapon of choice 'The Humbolt' (hold the onions).  Try the thick, fudgy 'hemp' brownies for dessert."
0,"Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember"
0,"Ugh... what a disappointment!  \nAtmosphere was a little blah in my opinion.... had a cheap feel to it.  \nNo lunch menu so we were force to pay dinner prices $34 including tip.\nChips were okay, but both the green and red salsas were awful!  I don't even know how to explain the flavor... no bueno!\nI ordered the Chile Relleno and my girl ordered the enchilada/taco combo.  We weren't impressed with either dish.  Mediocre at best.\nEverything seemed a bit over seasoned (and maybe just not seasoned well)... \n\nReally unfortunate because we were hoping for a good Mexican restaurant close to home :("
1,"Before I review, I must say that for only going once, the impression left is very strong I very much recommend Su Vino. Before even talking about wine, the customer service focus is amazing. From all the Bridal Shows my fiance and I have been to, they are always so accommodating as far as costs for event rental and the way the owner handles business is great. I am currently in charge of our wedding rehearsal dinner/party, and this is the #1 spot I have set on my list. If we go through with it, it will be a blast. \n\n*As for our experience at the bar........*\n\nMy fiance and I went here on a Groupon about a year and a half ago. We haven't been back since. Its not our fault though, we've just been so busy.....sigh... Even without the Groupon, I would come by here, and we are planning on doing so shortly.  The wine tasting was great, and the platter we tried really added to wine pairing. Being a semi-wino, I enjoyed trying the varieties, while my fiance went right for the desert wines. Its nice to know they make in-house such a wide variety of wines for everyone to try,. \n\nConsidering the wines they make are privately made, and not \""mass-produced\"", the bottled wine to be purchased is also quite reasonable. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance of the location lends to a relaxing chill mood, rather than a fast paced guzzle-fest or a upper class snooty wine bar. We were able to play some fun board games while sipping on wines, and we stayed for a good couple hours just taking the location in and playing games. I can't wait to come back!!!!"
1,love that they have great vegetables with brown rice since I dont eat meat.
0,"Well apart from having my ears assaulted by the same song in mandarin on repeat.. with the requisite 'skip' in the soundtrack... the food was really nothing spectacular and not the least bit authentic.. tho the forks and spoons on the tables in place of chopsticks was a dead giveaway for the \""authenticity\"".. \n\nThe decor is 'sparse' to say the least.. the one waiter put on some weird accent and tried to be all chummy.. \""how was that, pal? enjoy that buddy? etc.\""... then proceeded to ask us where in America we were from.. uhhh... we're NOT?! Then he was like.. so where are you from then? But threw in \""Europe? Canada?\"" before we'd had a chance to answer.. then when D finally managed to say \""Edinburgh\"" the waiter seemed to lose interest completely and we pretty much got the cold shoulder for the rest of the meal... WTF??\n\nHe then proceeded to offend someone else at a table which was behind me, all I heard was him apologising repeatedly to the woman who at one stage slapped the table!\n\nAll the main dishes were far too heavily flavoured.. the chicken & cashew in yellow bean sauce and mixed veg were far too salty.. the sweet & sour pork too vinegary.. it was a good thing the mixed fried rice was pretty bland along with the prawn & green pepper..\n\nHighlight was probably the banana fritter for dessert although the nondescript syrup it came with was too sweet... \n\nWe ate here out of desperation & convenience.. I've been right not to set foot in this place in the 4 years I've live in Edinburgh and I don't see myself setting foot in here again...."
0,Wasn't a big fan. Service was not up to par and took an unusually long time.
1,"\""Stately and pleasantly it sat, A compact house and strong. Then I went in: The door of it was hung beef, the threshold was dry bread, \ncheese-curds the walls.\"" -12th Century Traditional Celtic Song.\n\nWho knew that cheese curds were musical? I had a hunch, but, until last night, I hadn't had the opportunity to sing their song. They are squeaky balls of fried goodness that locals may take for granted, but this chronic traveler is freakin excited about them. If you wanna devirginize your curdishness, please do it at Madison's The Old Fashioned. That they are just a side dish to a full menu of amazing food and drink is a bonus.\n\nA production of Madama Butterfly brought me to Madison, and The Old Fashioned was recommended to me by many locals. So a few colleagues and I ventured over from our place nearby on Capitol Square, on a frigid, snow-flurrying Sunday evening. \n\nThe menu is fairly big, but unlike some of the major pubfood-make-a-pig of-yourself-chains, each item on this local gem's menu seemed to relate somehow to each other. It was as if you could choose any three things from the menu, in any combo, and have a great meal.\n\nAfter a pal and I shared the fried cheese curds and stopped crying from the pleasure, I chose the Old Fashioned Burger. It was perfectly done, and crowned with a delicious fried egg. The gooey yolk (called dippy eggs where I come from) mixed with the \""garlic sauce\"" on the burger. Is it sad that I could have eaten two of these? My colleagues had the Scandavian Chicken dinner and the salmon salad. Perhaps the chicken was a little dry, but it was such a generous, fresh portion that you found a way to adjust your taste buds to enjoy the dryness. It's sorta like pretending to enjoy the taste of shrooms when preparing to trip out on them. The payoff is worth it.\n\nThis was all chased with a New Glarus Organic Revolution, which was on tap for $2.50 a pint (what?) and a piece of the apple pie with aged Wisconsin cheddar on top. When I say a piece, I mean an entire wedge.\n\nI have a few more weeks in Madison, and am looking forward to trying a few other things at the Old Fashioned.  The menu of \""lazy susans\"" really has my attention right now....one with brats and sausages and  deviled eggs...come on.\n\nSqueaky curds-freakishly addictive, like the finest, phattiest herbal blunt, but way cheaper."
1,We were seated immediately & our waiter C\u00e9sar was very attentive.  My sister & I wanted to share a plate. We ordered the Pollo Con Queso. It was my first time having this dish. It is so good! Overall experience was great!
0,"Got my sisters car detailed as a gift for her.  They did a good job on detail but they removed items from the car (garage door remote and other items) and did not put them back.  My sister drove home to California and she noticed that the items were missing.  I went back to the car wash and secured the remote (they do have a lost and found).  They offered me nothing for my inconvenience and pretty much shrugged it off as it's your responsibility to check and make sure everything is in the car when you leave. Hey, I did not take it out of the car!!!  I will never go there again, they just lost about $ 300 plus of business a year plus the tips to the car wash guys."
1,"There's good pizza to be found! The price is a bit less than most other places, and the choices are fabulously unique. On a whim we decided to order from this place, and couldn't have been happier with the turn out. Not only are the pizza's tasty but the bread sticks are given in ample supply. I swear as long as this place exists, I will never eat at a pizza hut, or dominoes as long as I live within it's delivery circumference."
1,"So I've been in Vegas for a few weeks now , just moved , I stumbled on this place called FAME and the place is awesome but inside of FAME, there is a this burger place , wow , probably one of the best burgers I've ever had , with a Japanese fusion they take a relatively plane item and make it so flavorful , the Katsu chicken sandwich is also great , this place is a must try , the staff is so friendly and really make an effort to make you have a great time , I'll def come back ! Fantastic 4 !!"
1,"Recently rented a minivan to fit the visiting grandchildren.  The entire transaction was a breeze plus the people on the phone, at the desk and drop off woman were terrific!  I would use them again and highly recommend them to all my friends."
1,"Here Friday nights could be noisy for you, if you hate dance and music. Food is fresh and tasty. The PITA is AWESOME!"
1,Great martinis and sushi. A little small although it doesnt bother me if you don't like to sit inside they have a patio as well. The sushi is fresh and they have a great happy Hour! The bartenders are fantastic!
0,The food is definitely worth 4 stars and the atmosphere is very cool looking but I can't believe how rude the hosts are every time I come here. Last time me & my fianc\u00e9 came here it was on a Friday night and this place is never busy. So they asked if we had a reservation and we said no & then they sat us at a tiny little table in the back corner. The guy host wouldn't let us move to the table next to us which was a little bigger because he said it was reserved. So after we got the bill and we're done with our food he sat these two guys at the table near us and the guys wanted to move to the table next to us and the host said sure and sat them there not before glancing at me and my fianc\u00e9 with a smirk on his face. There is one waitress that always where's these tiny shorts with her butt cheeks hanging out that might as well be underwear which isn't exactly what I want to be looking at while I eat my food. But if you are looking for good hospitality this place doesn't have it.
0,"First let me say I will never come back to this place and they jacked my Coach sunglasses!! I was impressed upon initially walking in b/c it smelled great. They offer you a free taste of bread as you walk in. My bf went w/ red, white and blue. It was good but not spectacular. I went w/ Coconut Walnut. OMG really good. but the service RUINED it for me. \n\nWe came in for a brkfst sandwich of which they only have 2 options eggs and ham or eggs and bacon - seems simple enough right? you also (acc'd to the paper you write your order down on yourself ) to add tomato or green pepper. Odd combo but ok. mybf ordered \n1) ham, egg, cheese, tomato and green peppers\nme i ordered:\n2) bacon, egg, cheese and green peppers\n\nwell first she came back .. do you want cheese? \nyes.. i circled cheddar.. ok\nthen she came back.... we are out of wheat bread do you want another?\nwell.. yeah (i dont want to eat a bread free sandwich)... what do youhave?\nher: we have xyz and soudough\nme: ok Ill have soudough (my bf ordered white)\n\nwe finally get our order - both were on sourdough I might add.. \nNeither had tomato or green peppers... \nmy bf took his bk and asked about it and she just looked @ him and said well.. what do you want me to do?\nthe BF: he said well can you fix it? \nshe started  um... well.. um.. and um... er... \nfinally my bf just said well can you give it to me on the side? \nHER: yeah that's a good idea. you can see the photo on the side.\n\n\nI walked out and realized I had left my Coach glasses on the table. I went bk in and they were already gone. This was not a place I'd ever go back. After this neither of the girls would look us in the eye. it seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing.. One of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread.. um.. so that means its ok to mess up our order b/c you start your workday early? \nThe fact this place was empty should've tipped us off. As we left there was an elderly couple walking in, I said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are TOO COMPLICATED for them to make and they've been working since 5 (she said it, me.. so this was not an insult, just a disclaimer I was passing along)"
0,"The worst lasagna I have ever eaten in my life. For $12.95, I got fake meat that has been sitting in the warmer the entire day. The server was in no rush to serve me either; gossiping with another worker was more important than attending to the only customer who was standing before them - RUDE."
0,"I used to frequent this place for lunch. I never had a bad experience during the lunch hours so we decided to try it for breakfast. We ordered two regular menu items and one kids item. The kids item was split by my two children. On the menu, it states one juice is included with the meal for kids. Following breakfast comes the bill. $5.00 for one glass of orange juice! You have got to be kidding me - is there top shelf vodka included with that price? Not only that, but the orange juice is not included as a juice option as stated on the kids menu. So, we thought there was a mistake considering they charged us $10.00 for two kids orange juices. Nope, apparently not - they charge $5.00 for kids orange juice. Get real! We won't be back, ever."

1,"Once upon a time, there was an amazing burger place right outside of SouthPark Mall: The Counter. This place was amazing, and when it closed I was devastated. Once it was replaced with The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, my grief quickly went away. The Cowfish is absolutely amazing. It's owned by the same people who own eeZ in Birkdale, and having dined there, I knew the food would be delicious &amp; inventive, and I was absolutely right. But then again, I'm always right =)\n\nThe Cowfish has the traditional style rolls (Philly, rainbow, etc) and a huge list of wildly inventive &amp; exotic rolls to choose from as well. When Graham &amp; I visited the day after Christmas, I wanted to try something different than I had ordered on previous visits. We decided on three (although I wanted about ten...), one from each section: the rainbow (a traditional roll), the blackened tuna (a more unique/fusion style roll) &amp; the Doug's Filet Roll (burgushi).\n\nI'll start with the burgushi, because it's what makes The Cowfish stand out above other sushi restaurants (and Charlotte has a TON of them!). Burgushi is taking the elements of a burger and making it into a sushi roll, or taking the elements of a sushi roll and making it into a burger/sandwich.\n\nThis was amazing. It was a Philly roll, topped with a piece of seared filet mignon, spicy sauce, scallions & masago. Absolutely amazing. I could even look past the blob of cream cheese (which I HATE in sushi). The roll was enormous, but everything about it was perfect, I really loved the spicy sauce and the very mild flavor of the filet. This is definitely my favorite item on the \""burgushi\"" part of the menu, so far. \n\nThe Rainbow Roll was, of course, my favorite. It was a California roll topped with assorted fish & spicy sauce. The fish was fresh & firm, the sauce was nice & didn't overpower the roll. I absolutely hate it when there is so much sauce you can't really taste anything else. I would have been more than happy to eat this all day. \n\nThe last roll we had was the blackened tuna: Lump crabcake mix & cream cheese inside, rolled in temoura flakes, topped with blackened tuna, guacamole & a slice of jalepeno. \n\nWhile this roll was good, it didn't compare to the other two. The roll tasted dry & the slice of jalapeno was completely overpowering. However, the guacamole was a nice touch and absolutely delicious. I removed the jalapeno and added a different kind of heat with a little srirachia. It was a better flavor combination, in my opinion and I enjoyed the remaining pieces a lot more with this change. \n\nNot only was the food excellent during our lunch time visit, but the service was excellent as well. Our server took the time to go over every single aspect of the menu, and gave us a recommendation out of each category. The Filet Roll was one of her suggestions, and I'm so glad we went with that. \n\nMy ONLY complaint here is that they are always busy, and they only take reservations from 11:00-6:00, which makes zero sense to me. Especially since most of the shops in the area (excluding the mall), close at 6:00 or 7:00. Lunch patrons can browse & shop while waiting for a table. Dinner patrons can not. I had wanted to eat here for our anniversary, but knew we would have to either wait forever or eat at the bar, so we changed our plans. We still had to wait, but 15 minutes isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things. Last time I went was on a Thursday night, and the wait was much, much longer so we ended up dining at the bar. Fine for a dinner with a friend, not as okay for an anniversary dinner with your husband. However, this place is worth the wait and I can not wait to go back on my next trip home."
1,"My family is from New York City and we were DYING for some rice. (We asians love our rice) We were driving around Chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the Chinatown Plaza caught our eye, so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurants. \nNothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw Spicy City. It was pretty empty inside, only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant, a very friendly and jolly man, popped his head out and says \""please! come try out the food! it's amazing, my wife cooks it!\"" \n\nThis man did not lie. We had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup. Everything was delicious, and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family. However, the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isn't very good at eating spicy foods, tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this restaurants lives up to its name. \n\nI recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night!"
0,"My grandparents came into town from Florida and wanted to go to dinner. Their absolute favorite food is seafood and being that they live in a place where great seafood is available everywhere, I wanted to take them someplace that would not disappoint. Anytime I have ever asked anyone where to get good seafood at in Arizona, the answer has always been The Salt Cellar.  \n\nI want to start off by saying the service staff in every aspect was stellar.  We showed up with one more person than we had anticipated and the hostesses were quick to make the last minute accommodation. The ladies in your bar were so sweet, and our server was amazing. \n\nIn regards to the food, my sister and I ordered oysters on the half shell, which were the best we have ever had. My mom got the crab stuffed shrimp and really enjoyed it. My sister and I also split the crab legs and filet. Unfortunately, this is where things take a different direction.  Crab legs were great, but the medium filet was not seasoned at all and was chewy.  My fifteen year old son got the filet and shrimp.  He liked the shrimp, but said the steak was not good, and he usually likes, and will pretty much eat everything with no complaints. My grandfather's fish was overcooked, and my grandmother's fried shrimp was soggy.  We had cold veggies on our plates that tasted like they were warm at one time, but had sat out for quite awhile.  \n\nLet me just say, money is not the issue here.  Our bill was 317 dollars after tip, for an average of about 53 dollars per person. Totally reasonable for a great meal. When it comes to amazing food, service and atmosphere I would pay double that.  I do realize this is a seafood restaurant, however for the amount of money that is being charged I would expect to leave feeling that EVERYTHING was amazing.  I originally thought about going to The Keg which is similarly priced. I have ordered different steak and seafood dishes there many times and each time said to my husband, \""Oh my God. I loved every part of that dinner!\"" However, I wanted to take my grandparents to a local restaurant and not a chain restaurant that they could go to anytime in Florida. After hearing the great things about this restaurant, I decided to take a chance and go here instead. I was honestly SO surprisingly disappointed and to be frank, embarrassed that I suggested it. It was just, eh. Everyone left saying \""It was ok, but not great.\"" My mom and sister who also live here said it was totally not what they had expected. \n\nI did not want to tell the server about this in front of my whole family when he asked how everything was, not to mention we were in a hurry and could not have had our dinners remade at that time had they offered. So I decided to return home and email the manager. In her response she just proceeded to tell me that the issue is their food supplier and not the preparation. She made absolutely no attempts to regain our service. I would have given this restaurant at least three stars but after receiving her reply bumped it down to a 1."
1,There are so many options no when it comes to hotels in vegas.. but this place sets itself apart from the competition with affordable rates and great customer service- the clubs there are cool but always a long wait . even if you have a table. \nthe steak house there is better than the sushi restaurant. \nthe pool is not the best party pool in vegas but it gets the job done.
0,"We are regulars and the French Makeover and taking things off the menu has made us go a lot less often. They took bananas, red apples and carrots off the menu, They have virtually nothing for kids there that kids like.  I guess kids are now longer welcome in the FRENCH restaurant.  Our kids used to LOVE to go there. Management is rarely seen and they seem to gossip alot about the other staff.  Nothing is consistent anymore, the excuse is the cooks vary in ability. What is left on the menu has hokey French names and every little thing is EXTRA. This was a restaurant that was like a neighborhood meeting place prior to the French takeover.  Unfortunately, we are looking for a new favorite neighborhood restaurant. We need one less stuffy that has a manager that you can actually talk to Anthony used to walk around from time to time but not anymore. Haven't seen his face in over a year, when I ask for him the staff says he is not there. Assistant managers seem to all pass the buck except Kathy and the team leaders seem to be above doing the little extras when you ask them for something. I must say Steve, Justin, Christine, Maureen, Etla, and Leah all are wonderful .Wifi is VERY slow.  Never see management out and about like you do at other restaurants. I guess that is a sign that they don't want to hear why their customers have to say."
0,"Short story:  AVOID\n\nLong story: Went in, filled up with $80+ in gasoline.  Had a fussy baby I was managing and also due to waiting in line for an excessive amount of time found myself needing to use the restroom.   A youngish girl with no customer service skills read me the riot act about needing to stay with my car until I could pull it forward to the vacuum station, then I would be allowed to go inside to pay.  \n\nAnyways, it is that type of cold, careless, mean-spirited behavior that drives customers away.  It sure did for me.  NEVER GOING BACK.  \n\nSo how did it work out?  I walked inside to the bathroom, and they magically found a way to move my car ten feet forward to the next position before driving it through the wash.  As far as the mean little girl with attitude?  I do not really know, but I suspect living in a trailer park is in her future."
0,Got an Americano and thought the espresso was weak. Place has a stale vibe and the gentleman barista was very monotone. It made me not want to be in their. My 2 friends felt the same way. Can you say overrated ?
0,Didn't stay here but we got stuck in their elevator for an hour. Had a terrible experience sitting in an elevator with a bunch of ladies who were freaking out and we got comped dinner at Milo's which took forever to bring the food out. I will never stay here nor will I ever come to their restaurants or shops ever. Should of called the fire department as soon as the elevator stopped.
0,"I've never really had a good experience with buffets. Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.\n\nYes, it's Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThe establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.\n\nFirst off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place....\n\nThey had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to \""Chinese\"" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I've never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn't sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn't anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn't have half-and-half... Everything ersatz! \n\nFresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal. \n\nLunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a \""Vegas\"" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.\n\nThere's a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I'm willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women's bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men's restroom.\n\nWhy 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9."
0,"So Ive been to this gentleman's club twice, not on purpose... \n  \nBasically to get in is free the guys just need to buy drink vouchers outside. \n\nThe girls were not that good looking but I guess its dark and with a couple drinks the dark room turns into somewhat of a looking glass where your watching it from the distance. Some of the women were going up to the guys who were buying bottle service but we just sat there with our cheap drinks looking at the main stage, \n\nall and all you get what you pay for.... not much."
0,"Wow....where do I start. We headed to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and because I love sushi I wanted to experience it Las Vegas style. I went onto Yelp to see what people had to say and discovered Sushi Roku. I literally read through each and every review to see what the hype was all about. Everyone kept talking about how great the wait staff was and how if its your birthday you get even \""better\"" treatment. \nWe showed up for our dinner reservations (and the host staff and wait staff was aware at this time that it was my birthday) and the two hostesses were so cold to my party. We then were seated at a window seat which was great I have to admit, the views were wonderful. \nThe \""waitress\"" finally after about 8 minutes decided to grace us with her presence and didn't introduce herself to us and blankly took our drink order. My first thought was \""wow she is so not personable\"". It proceeded to go down from there. The food arrived so that one person was eating like 10 minutes before any of the other food arrived for the table. She never gave us the time of day but was working the other tables. Finally one of my friends asked her if she was aware it was my birthday and with a cold glare she said \""yes\"". At that point I was ticked, you would think as a wait person (which I have done for years in my past professions) that you would try a little harder for the tip you EXPECT to receive from a group. \nNeedless to say I approached the manager on the way out and told him that I felt very disappointed in my experience there and obviously they should look at their staff members. I would never go back there based on my experience. If you do try it good luck hopefully you get someone nice but dont expect anything special even on your birthday."
0,"Weeeeeeeell that might be it for me at LLXAtwood. \nJust one too many things soured my dining experience today...\n...not certain I can go back. \n\nI walked in (admittedly towards the end of the lunch rush) and was astonished that nearly every table was covered with dirty dishes. Now I've worked in restaurants, I understand when you're hit hard it can be challenging to keep up with tables that need to be bused. I've also eaten in a lot of restaurants, which makes me qualified to say things like tables covered with dirty dishes don't scream \""welcome, sit yourself down, you're in for a treat!\"" The waitress gave me a warm welcome, encouraged me to sit anywhere I wanted, but given my choices (a clean table or a dirty one) there were two... two tables in the entire restaurant to choose from. \n\nThings got worse from there. \n\nMy egg roll was undercooked, cold on the inside and doughy. Why doughy? No clue. But doughy. \n\nThe wontons in the wonton soup were melt in your mouth, and not in a good way. Melt in your mouth because the dumplings were overcooked. No bite. No chew. \n\nAnd while their version of Pad Thai was tasty, at 3 stars, which ought to be moderate was so spicy I had to ask for several additional napkins. Waitress must have thought I said several more spices, because she brought two over. Ironic. Unfortunate.\n\nAlso unfortunate is the fact that this place is so drastically different than LLXWilly. It's bigger and the hours are better, but neither are enough to make me want to give them another go after today."
1,Never disappointed! This is one of my go-to's. Their salads are totally worth the money - one is enough for two meals or two people to share. The chips and queso is soooo good if you're looking to splurge. It's also enough to share - one serving will serve 2+ people. \n\nMake sure to get their stamp card!
0,"This Chuck E Cheese's location is similar to whiping before you use the toilet; it's all out of order.  The only reason I used a poop reference is that this place is crappy.\n\nWe came here on Memorial Day with the kids (4 and 6) for some pizza and fun.  The pizza is similar to Little Caesers, and is perfectly fine for kids, but the fun wasn't as easy to swallow. \n\nThere were at least 6 machines that did not work, yet had no out-of-order sign posted.  While this place isn't the most expensive source of entertainment for kids in the valley, nobody should be tossing their money away due to a lazy staff.\n\nThe bathrooms were messy, and the place had an overall dirty feeling to it.  When it came time to cash in the kids' tickets, we waited at the ticket counter for a good ten minutes before being helped.  Do you realize that they have prizes listed for 150,000 tickets?  Can you imagine having 150,000 tickets in a drawer somewhere in your house?  Ridiculous!!\n\nFor the money you'll waste here, you're better off doing something outside with the kids, ordering (or cooking) pizza, and then taking them to the toystore; it will be cheaper, healthier, and less mousey."
0,food sucks...me and a friend order a blt....very salty bacon and they use cabbage instead of lettace....its call a BLT....wtf...there is no cabbage in BLT....\n\nService was average.....food sucks...my other friend had the rotisserie chicken...he was disappointed...\n\nThe food is very expensive for a cafe...I don't recommend....
0,"THE WORST FOOD FOR YOUR MONEY EVER\nActually, the service was good, but the food....\nHappy hour deals tasted worse then McDonalds, greasy and tiny. We've eaten in many expensive 4-5 stars restaurants, and \""Seablue\"" was a joke...\nBeef carpaccio that we ordered tasted horrible, and the portion was extremely tiny even for a bird. \nThe entrees that we ordered didnt taste anything close to a restaurant food, and again, portion is misearable...\nFor the quality of food you are getting- price is way too high.\nAll and all our experience with the food was substandart\nDo Not Go!!!"
0,"Service- 1 star. Food- 4 stars. Drink prices- -5 stars!\n\nWe went here after seeing KA across the street and just wanted to get a beer and split some giant plate of nachos or something. We were seated really quickly, but sat for at least 5 minutes, craving water, before our server wandered over.\n\nI must pause here to just address something that drives me CRAZY- when restaurants do not post alcoholic beverage prices in their drink menu, (not the server's fault obviously). Do you think by not posting them I will somehow forget that SKYY is more expensive than Taaka? I know it might get people to buy a more expensive drink unknowingly, but we just wanted beer prices. They had draft imports and domestics, and bottled imports and domestics. \n\nWhen our server came by- we practically shouted \""water!\"" at him and then asked about beer prices. Dear God- $5 for a domestic bottle- $7.5 for a draft. I'm sorry- did we suddenly end up on some foreign planet where beer is equivalent to currency? Have you forgotten that we are on a casino floor and that I could therefore go sit at a penny slot for five seconds and receive a free beer? Obviously they can't compete with free, but since I can walk to the Coors factory from my front door, charging me $7.5 for sixteen ounces of it is one of the most absurd things I've ever heard of. It's even cheaper at Red Rocks than here.\n\nWe order chicken nachos; another reviewer talked about their steak nachos, and our server did make sure to tell us that these are different things in that the steak nachos are individually made nachos- every one is uniform. The ones we ordered were a huge pile with lots of toppings thrown around. It had a ton of chicken, and was also slightly cheaper. \n\nWe had to wait at least another five minutes for water. In fact we tried to get some from the bar. when we finally got our water, we drank it and never got a refill. Our food came and the incredibly kind and responsive food runner gave us a refill immediately, which isn't his job. Finally our server gave us one more refill. It took 10 minutes to get the check after we asked. \n\nThe food was really pretty good, but I could have probably walked the length of the strip in the time it took to get anything from our server."
1,"I'm the type of girl that really just loves food of all kinds. I can eat (and appreciate!) Joel Robuchon & Alex one day and be content to eat Little Caesars the next. I honestly think the $5 (ALWAYS hot and ready) pizzas are an insane value. \n\nThey are pretty damn tasty, easy for me to pick up on a whim, and service is always great too. For $2.75 or so I can add on a crazy pack of tasty crazy bread + sauce. For $7.75 I have tasty food to feed the husband and I for 2 days! This is one of those cases where you do NOT get what you pay for. This pizza transcends its' $5 price tag. No, it's not Settebello, but sometimes when you want cheap food RIGHT NOW this is the perfect fix. \n\nPS - I think this place is infinitely better than Sbarro/Villa Pizza and those sorts of places."
0,"Customer service here is the worst I have ever experienced. I will not shop at Bass Pro again. I bought a gun and had to wait 3 days to pick it up. When I went to pick it up, you have to take a number to get waited on, I got my number and with one person in front of me, had to wait for over an hour to be waited on so I could get my gun. There were at least 4 people working behind the counter and most of what they did was talk to each other. I will shop elsewhere from now on."
0,"When I eat at a Ruth's Chris, I've come to expect excellent food and even better service.  My experience at this location, however, did not meet my expectations.\n\nIt's located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient, but the fa\u00e7ade was not very impressive.  Our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone, instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.\n\nThe waitress was friendly, but gave the \""welcome to Ruth's Chris\"" spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.\n\nI ordered the Crabatini which was excellent.  A friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table, though, and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.  It also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bits into.  \n\nShortly before our steaks arrived, an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable server's assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we don't get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.  My ribeye steak and the rest of our party's filets arrived.  After taking my first bite, I thought, where is all of the sizzling butter I was warned about and craved?  The steak was good, but just not as great as all of the other times I've been.  My side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as I remember though.\n\nAfter finishing about  1/2 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma, I realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.  It is Vegas in the summer time; it is alright to crank the air conditioning up!  There was no dessert for me; I just wanted to flee the scene.  \n\nI am sure I'm being overly critical but Ruth's Chris is supposed to be a top notch steak house with superb service.  Other times I've visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars; maybe this location just needs some new management.   \n\nI will return, but just not to this location."
1,"Aside from the particular location of this one being terrible and really only easy for people who've been here before, I'll go off now and state I have been a big fan of Tagliani's for QUITE some time now!\n:)\n\nVery different from your family owned italian restaurants, and a bit different than Buca Di Beppo and Carrabba's. \n\nMostly intimate style seating, with a bar as well. Beer's are served in what most use as Soda glasses? and Garlic Bread is served before your meal but no cheese or marinara or anything. \nLunch specials are great, menu has been reduced in size it seems but still all pasta's you'd expect with a great selection of sauces and drinks as well"
0,"I've been to the Urban Tea Loft four times now, and all four times it has been an awful experience. I guess I continued to go because i wanted to support the restaurant and I understand the meaning behind the tea concept, and admire the owner for the fight against cancer.\n\nLet me be honest by saying the food is decent. Mac and cheese is great... SERVICE is extremely slow... Give me a break...we were 1 of 2 tables there.... At the start of the morning... Can't be busy when there's only 9 tables and ONLY 2 were taken up. \n\nMy guy and I ordered bloody mary's... First let me say, there wasn't  any garnish and there wasn't any seasoning in the drink! It was pure tomato juice. Second, we ordered... I ordered French toasts, and my guy ordered the ribeye skillet...I waited ten minutes after I placed my order to check in through yelp... We waited 37 minutes not including the 10 i waited prior...and still no food... So I walked over to the server and politely asked for the check and they kept saying \""are you sure you want it.. Your food is really almost out\"" you kidding me.. Almost out?!  Uh... Let me think.... No crap... I would really like it... Basically she never did what I asked.. Instead she came back with the food... The ribeye...was raw... I ate my French toast cause I was so... hungry! but give me a break... Absolutely no comp on anything... Manager nor the owner didn't even come out to apologize... How ridiculous is this?!!! \n\nI don't like to write bad reviews, This is actually my first...and forgive me for grammar but I just am still so annoyed. I gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt and every time they have let me down. No excuse for poor service... We paid full price for everything, absolutely nothing was comped and it was obvious I was upset, but wasn't rude.. I just simply said \""I'm sorry, but 47 minutes is a very long time to wait for French toast, so we would like our check and pay for our drinks...\""And I still tipped 20% ask me why?! I have no clue... I've been a server and in no way would I ever let my customers leave unhappy.. I would apologized, get their food comped, get a manager and make sure if they do ever come in again they will be well taken care of. No excuse for such poor service... The Restaurant wasn't busy... I crap bricks when I left!\n\nI don't recommend to eat in.. Maybe order togo, but that's it. The $40 I spent on breakfast I could've been in and out stuffed at BLD. No thank you for the 5th visit... This place really pinched my nerves... 4 visits and each visit has always been extremely slow...restaurant is too small to be overwhelm when the restaurant isn't even full... 2 servers for 9 tables... Please don't tell me it's too much to handle. Well, I will never return here again... Those who have gone here and have gotten great service and didn't have as long of a wait for food.. GOOD FOR YOU! They need customers somewhere and somehow."
1,"Tried this place for the first time on Wednesday and it did not disappoint.  The rolls were fresh and delish and you can't beat the price.  \n\nMy favorite rolls (that I will be ordering again) are the Perfect Match Roll, Anything Roll, and Tiger Roll.  \n\nThis place might have the best sushi in town."
1,"While the Blackstone hotel is near a not so great area, the hotel itself is well maintained. Also, the provided shuttles keep you from having to wander into that area and allow you to get around with ease. I have to say, I was most impressed by the modern decor. It was fun and unexpected. While the staff seemed disheveled (understaffed, perhaps?), they were very friendly and made my stay enjoyable. Will recommend to friends."
0,I originally booked my stay in Vegas here at Ballys.  After check in I went to the room and I couldn't believe the bad odor of cigarette smoke.  I called the frond desk and they seemed put out that I wanted a different room.  After waiting two hours I told them that I was canceling my stay and decided to go to a different hotel Casino.
1,"Went here two Saturday nights ago. Very busy but that is what drew us in. We had planned on dining at the center across the street, however, due to lack of parking we crossed the street to the center where Hong Kong Garden was. We drove by and saw almost every table was filled and with Asian people (good sign for a Asian restaurant). So we dined here. \n\nI would probably give it four and a half . The service was abrupt. Which didn't bother me but they were all business. Very matter of fact, quick service quick food but not rude just felt busy.  But they offered us free soup, we didn't have it because we ordered fish maw but it was still nice they offered and we were provided with some free dessert. I still don't know what the dessert was, it was a yellow sweet broth with what seemed to be a chicken base and maybe some sort of root vegetable in it. \n\nThey seemed very authentic as to what the menu offered. Many dishes such as duck tongue etc. We had the eggplant hot pot, the beef was a little too fatty for me but hubby loved it. I guess fat = flavor, however, I still would have preferred it a little leaner. The eggplant was good too, and there was not thick sweet cornstarch coating as in most fast food Chinese places.  Also, we had the BBQ half duck - yum! and a great price I believe we paid around $10. About a quarter of it was too bony though with little to no meat, but that is to be expected for duck. The table next to us had giant clam - it looked very impressive. \n\nThe fish maw was bland but the waitress informed us it is popular, just not our taste. \n\nWorth a try if you are looking for authentic Hong Kong style cuisine..."
1,This is my new favorite small restaurant for Mexican food! I have been here 3 times and liked everything I ordered. The chile relleno burrito is great. The Arizona burrito is really a treat with the added pieces of bacon inside the burrito with potato and meat. I went last Friday for a business lunch and had the tacos. They are to die for! Ok!  fellow gringo's don't forget to ask for some limes to squeeze on top of your food. It will really give your food that bam!
0,"Our room was dirty, smelled of smoke though it is supposedly nonsmoking, and smelled of urine."
1,"Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy."
1,"We are quickly becoming regulars here. The patio is always nice even when it's 100 out due to the great misters and nice seating. Service is always great and they actually have a couple great healthy menu options now, the shrimp and spinach salad is probably one of the best salads I've ever  had! Lots of good beers on tap as well!"
0,"This place COULD be cool, but the owners are meth heads and nobody cool goes there. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen anyone in there. It's usually empty when I drive by or stop in. \n\nI don't like going there though even though it's really close to my house and it's \""punk themed\"". Not really punk except for the fact that it's all beat up and shitty."
0,"I love Soma, unfortunately for me, the Kierland store rans out of size Small really fast when they have their crazy sales.  So I decided to check out the store at the Biltmore.  Upon entering the store, the two clerks completely ignored me.  I didn't care because I knew what I wanted and headed straight to the sale rack.  They had a couple of the dresses and pjs I wanted in size small.  I grabbed them and headed to the register.  I told the woman that was up front that I was ready.  She started talking to the other sales clerk.  Then she asked me if someone was helping me, of course I said no and I was ready to pay.  She started ringing without even asking for my passport member #.  I shop at this store a lot, so I get an additional discount; I informed her, she needed to search for my number.  Finally we were about to be done when the phone rings and she decided to pick up at the first ring, I was waiting and waiting, until I told her I needed to have this rung since I had a spa appointment.  Wow,  I am trying to give you money, you should value your customers a little more."
0,"I am a fan of Ikea for the most part and this review is less about the merchandise and more about the complete lack of service coupled with a massive amount of attitude. Tacky. I went with a good friend of mine to Ikea over Memorial Day weekend in hopes of getting a really great deal on a bed for her new apartment. A seemingly simple task one might think. Well, unbeknownst to us there was an elusive coupon needed at check out in order to purchase the bed/mattress combo. There was no signage posted and the sales associate upstairs (whose name escapes me) did not give us one. So, here we are, the store is closing and the sales girl, Randi,with an unbelievably abhorrent countenance, demands that we retrieve a coupon from upstairs and proceeds to laugh at my friend with a pompous smirk on her face. However, in the sales girl's supposed infinite knowledge and wisdom, she failed to realize that the store was closing, therefore THERE WAS NO ONE UPSTAIRS to give us this said coupon. Hoping there wasn't a storewide pandemic of awful dispositions, we looked to Randi's manager Todd for help. WRONG. The next gentleman (if you could call him that) was equally rude and condescending, claiming that \""there are signs posted everywhere telling you that you need a coupon...and maybe I can help you if I get the time.\"" We checked, and captain awful hair was, indeed, incorrect in his proclamation regarding the alleged \""signs.\"" At this point my friend is nearly in tears with frustration as we wanted to get out of there as much as they did. Then, captain early 90's pony tail looks and realizes his mistake. There is no flipping signage. He tried to apologize and be more accomodating by apathetically stating that \""oh they must have changed the signs.\""  We bypass the ridiculous coupon catastrophy only to be met with a flood of more aggravation.  My friend would like to pay with both card and cash. Apparently this is a near impossible task for the elite group of people that make up the Ikea employee squad.  At this point the quote un quote manager asks if I can put part of the total on my card as the tills have already been closed. Are you kidding me? This is so exceedingly tacky that I just stare at the poor girl blankly. Open up a register. There was a silver lining, however. Linda, who was the only in there with a brain, was walking by with a cash tray and rung us up. So we managed to pay the total and get out. Meanwhile, I have lost 45 minutes of my life that I can never get back because I have squandered it on completely unhelpful human beings. I just hope not all Ikeas are staffed with incompetent sales people full of attitude and self entitlement. We were not asking them to solve world hunger or the aids epedemic, we were simply after a little bit of compassion and professionalism."
0,"There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of Thai peanut sauce. Tasty indeed however, what a large mess this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich.\nWith this said, the staff was very nice. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches...."
0,"We had a nice dinner,, but my wife got food posioning..  She woke up 4am and was ill and continued to be ill that day..  Could keep nothing down and very dehiderated.   The management while polite seemed to think I was shaking them down when I asked for a partial discount off our $300 bill..   Rather hard to accept such an event when dining at such a place..  Better luck.."
1,"Love this place!! Loving the new entertainment  and service by staff! Great time on New Years Eve with the famous Butter Cake for dessert! Oh Yum!! \nHighly recommend for dinner, cocktails and entertainment!!"
1,Very good Chinese Food! Tender beef and tasty dumplings in a very nice and stresless environment.
1,"I went here the other day because they have a 1 free wax for first time customers (must be an Arizona resident). The girl that gave me a wax walked me through everything and made me feel really comfortable, even though I was nervous to begin with. She even recomended some products that I ended up buying! I'll be back!"
1,"Second times a charm for this chain of restaurants. I have tried Samurai Sam's in the past and have not been impressed. Although the food is not fancy or gourmet in any way, they offer a lot of healthy options for your buck. \n\nMy coworker and I are trying to watch what we eat, so I flipped through my Entertainment book to see what coupons I had for neighboring restaurants. We settled on Samurai Sam's and proceeded to order the Teriyaki Chicken Bowls with brown rice. I love that they have both brown rice and low carb (veggies instead of rice) as options. They also give you the choice of dark meat, white meat or mixed. Definitely a plus. The food was served up quickly and was pretty tasty as well. \n\nThis is definitely a location I will be back to."
0,"been there a couple of times , desserts good , but the foods really not , ordered steak diane and scampi last night , got 4 little less than bite size pieces of steak , normally steak diane is a small piece of steak , maybe they were just helping by cutting my meat for be , but when you cook little bite size pieces how can it be cooked medium rare , the shrimp scampi was 3 breaded fried shrimp with a sause , you know desserts good , ray"
1,"I am a huge fan of Korean BBQ.  Now to be honest, there are only a handful of Korean BBQ restaurants here in Las Vegas that are actually good.. good enough to leave you wanting more.  But that would then just mean you have to spend more to eat more!  \n\nI'm a frequent California visitor and that was the best part of my trip.. Korean BBQ Buffets.  There were none here in Las Vegas (until now).  I was extremely excited when I first saw the \""Coming Soon\"" when I saw woo che being built. \n\nThere are many different kinds of meat to choose from and a very nice selection of veggies and soups.  \n\nThis place gets 2 thumbs up from me, I actually might just head there tonight lol\n\nAll I can say is, Korean BBQ + Buffet = Heaven"
1,"This review is about the type of people that work at Kelly's Kawasaki.  I have no knowledge of who owns the business and have never had any personal relationship with anyone working there at any time.  What I can tell you is how they treated me, a total stranger, when I came to them for a favor.  If you're like me, you want to work with GOOD people that deserve your money and your time.  I can vouch for Kelly's Kawasaki - since even though they knew they weren't going to make a dime off me, they truly treated me with genuine kindness.\n\nMy husband and I were planning a graduation party for his son that just graduated from MMI (Motorcycle Mechanics Institute).  We were also planning to have our first child together, and money was beyond tight.  Graduation decorations were an expense we couldn't afford, so I had the bright idea to ask motorcycle dealerships from nearby to give us old posters they didn't need anymore, which we could put all over the house and yard.  My thought was that with new models coming out all the time, they'd have to get rid of old model advertising often, so we should be able to get some great donations.  I was dead wrong.  My husband and I went to every Harley Davidson, Yamaha and Kawasaki dealership and not a single one tried to help us out - except Kelly's.  \n\nWe walked into Kelly's Kawasaki and told them a quick version of what was going on, and the kid at the desk got a manager immediately, who listened to us and then rounded up about 50 different posters for us and put them in a big box for us to take home. They were so kind and considerate to us I started crying I was so grateful (granted I am pregnant).  They didn't have to act this way, they could've acted like every single other dealership and not wanted to give us their time or be kind.  Instead they were respectful and truly generous with their time and resources.\n\nFrom this act alone, I will never buy from any other dealership, I will always recommend them, and I ask that you consider this local business as your first stop, because they're good people."
0,"One of the biggest tourist traps around. Skip this overpriced crap and look for McDonald's in that one casino for cheap food, or a sit-down restaurant for a better value. $5.99 is apparently a \""special\"" price for two average (at best) slices of cheese pizza and a pretty small soda, and the rest of the menu is definitely overpriced. Only reason this gets two stars is that the food and service weren't actually horrible."
0,"If you could look up \""Doing It Wrong\"" in the dictionary there would be a picture of the Uptown Hooters next to it.\n\nA group of 9 of us (8 guys and me) went for a friend's birthday because they had ordered the UFC fight. The fact that even with the fight the place was half empty on a Saturday night should have said something, but we set in and ordered up food anD beers. Since we were a large group we were given two waitresses but they didn't coordinate so items we ordered kept not being entered. After the initial round of food all we were ordering was beer but even with an average order to table time of over 20 minutes we were still missing some pints (this may be because one of the waitresses said she was too young to serve beer so she had to relay the orders to a bartender who then forgot them).\n\nYou would think that after paying around a grand to be able to show the fight they would actually do so, and you would be wrong. They forgot to put it on until we reminded them and a few times switched the channel to King of Queens. When it was on, it was so low you couldn't hear, which was odd since it was the only thing our entire section was watching. Apparently the manager was the only one who could change it back and if I were him, after hearing one of the waitresses whine out my name at the top of her lungs every 5 minutes, I wouldn't be on my A game either. I feel sorry for you, David.\n\nMy bar for the food was low since it's Hooters (the breasts and thighs they specialize in aren't on a chicken). But even though I was drinking water, not beer, all night I still got sick later that night. Bar: not met.\n\nSo, bad service, lack of beer, poor fight showing, and questionable food. Yeah, I won't be going back."
1,"Note: we only get these sandwiches while catering food, so I'm not sure how the sit-down service is.  But honestly, when feeding 40 hungry auditors, this place is great.  The original, the club, the roast beef, and etc are staples to our diet.  And leftovers are no problem, since the sandwiches are pretty shelf-stable and are good the next day.  The bread isn't soggy and nasty, as you would expect.\n\nWe will definitely be ordering once a week again this year..."
1,"I called this location to ask how much they charged to check just the air in the tires and they said it was free! I decided since I am a silly girl and don't have an air guage, I should probably have someone check my tires.\n\nThey told me to pull up to the first garage and a friendly guy greeted me within 30 seconds and checked my tires. I also found out, if you purchase your tires there, they rotate them for free. Very nice!"
0,"---------------CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEW ONLY--------------\nThis is a rant but you know what, filter me for all I care but it's a valid rant. \n\nMy first interaction with these folks was an email that said \""RESERVATION CANCELLED\""...which was conveniently 3 DAYS BEFORE I'm even set out to fly this weekend. In the email they stated that they tried to get a hold of us because apparently the CC on file kept declining (long story on that but thanks a lot for that one Amex). They tried to get a hold of us?! Shoot, did we miss a call? Did we miss an email? No calls, and after going through all our emails, we found their ONE contact email in our spam folder. \n\nIt was titled \""cc decline\"" from Bailey Roberts. Who the hell is Bailey Roberts?  Doesnt even say Jet Luxury Resorts unless you were to open the spam-looking email. Doesn't even bother to capitalize your subject lines (normally I don't care but if you're a professional company, use proper grammar). FROM THE ONSET, THAT ALREADY LOOKS LIKE SPAM and NOT professional. Turns out, the email was sent 24 hours prior that simply said they needed a new card. First off, sucks that it got sent to spam because it LOOKED like spam mail but man, you don't even bother to try a second time?\n\nHere's why I'm really pissed off. This hotel was booked 6 months ago yet they cancelled on us last night. You're telling me we could have easily resolved this in the past 6 months but decided to not let us know there was a problem until the week of?\n\nBtw, the reservation was for this coming weekend which happens to be Memorial Day Weekend. Not sure if you've heard of this holiday but it's pretty big. Which also means, when you're booking a new hotel reservation 3 days away from a big holiday weekend, your prices are now almost 100-120% MORE than what you would have paid if you booked 6 months ago. Should've booked 6 months ago. Oh wait, WE DID DO THAT! And then we got it cancelled on us. \n\nAnd yes, it's our bad that we had a CC snafu so I understand that but man, couldn't customer service have tried harder than sending a hapless email?\n\nThanks but no thanks."
0,"I stayed here with the family for two nights during this past weekend for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Oh vey, what a mess.  We stayed here for free since my father is considered one of their V.I.P.'s.  They recently renovated their rooms, and IMO it doesn't look as nice as it did before.  \n\nThe room was much smaller than we remembered (we hadn't stayed here in more than a year), as well was the bathroom/shower size.  Everything in the room seemed outdated, especially the center nightstand since there were scratch and shipping marks all over it.\n\nDuring the first night, after pulling back the covers on one of the beds, we discovered this weird stain.  It looked like metal rust, but how can that happen on a BEDSHEET??  We called housekeeping and also requested extra towels, pillows, and tissue boxes.  It took them more than an hour to get to our room 'cause they couldn't find the pillows, which was terrible for us 'cause  we had to sleep for our early wake-up call the next morning.\n\nThe second night was much better: housekeeping service was faster, and the beds were a lot cleaner.  My sister had a cut on her hand and I even called and requested band-aids and anti-biotics, which security brought up for us.\n\nThe only great positive thing that I can think of is that we spent $150+ eating in their restaurants which were charged onto our room bill, but in the end, we only paid $15 when we check out.  Good enough.  I guess Mandalay Bay just loves his that much."
1,Fantastic deep dish pizza. Had the white pizza too!  Enjoyed both very much.
0,"These two stars are basically for ambiance and fantastic food.  Service is average at best, pool is free but the only thing more broken than the pool sticks is the pool tables themselves.  The beer selection is the worst for someone who values good beer, thank you but if my elite choice is a magic hat #9...  Even being with in walking distance to my house and the choice for my gambling induced friends, I would never go here and rarely do."
1,Excellent and you can bring your own wine.
1,"This is a great spot to chill and have a good drink. The mojito I had was awesome! I had to knock off a star bc the service is sometimes iffy and it's closed for private parties more than I would like.  But the music is good, the atmosphere is chill and the drinks very tasty."
0,"For anyone looking to make a booking for this hotel be advised that they have a very stringent and inflexible cancellation policy. I made a booking through hotels.com and had selected the option to pay upon arrival at the hotel. According to the policy there was free cancellation. I had something come up and was no longer able to make the trip and cancelled my reservation immediately after finding out, 4 days in advance of my trip and was still charged a one night fee for the room. The person in reservations named Ron whom I spoke with first asked me if I am canceling due to a death in the family, as if this could be the only justifiable reason for cancellation and when I explained that I had to cancel due to work reasons, he would not allow me to do so. No credit was offered for a future stay either. For anyone considering booking this hotel please make sure you read their cancellation policy closely."
0,WORST SERVICE EVER! There was not one person in  this entire hotel that we came across who didn't have an attitude or act like I wanted their kidney. There is a laundry list of horrible experiences from the checkin desk clerk to the wait staff to the bartenders And even the valet. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE EVER AGAIN OR RECCOMEND ANYONE ELSE DO THE SAME. \n\nLuna italian restaurant was even worse. The worst server on the the planet which was very sad because the food was good. Same thing for Harrys. I've never been more shocked at the things that came out of the staff's mouth than this weekend. \n\nAt all three locations we asked for managers and never did one appear. We were told none of them were on staff. One employee even told me that it wouldnt matter anyways because the managers here don't care about the hotel or guests anyways and suck so need to talk to them! Who talks ab out their boss like that?!!! WORST PLACE EVER PACK A TENT AND STAY IN THE PARKING LOT. YOU'LL HAVE A WAY BETTER TIME!
1,"You can't even get fresher crabs from a Fremont St. hooker. The sweetest crab I have EVER had. This place is super casual, service is exceptionally personable and friendly. Wear casual clothes, cause you'll be wearing bits of crab and juice on your way out. This is not your lazy man Alaskan king crab, but they are the king of crabs from a sweetness standpoint. Be ready to work for your meal and even though it's hammer time, you CAN touch this. Whack those crabs, take your time, enjoy friends. Don't be shy, look, search, and devour each sweet tender mini, meaty, morsel you can find. The crab cakes, also the best I have ever had. Sure they are small (half dollar size), but I suspect it is labor intensive getting enough of the Maryland crab picked to make the cakes, lots of meat, little filler, devine flavor. Boardwalk fries are made from fresh spuds, and are yummy too. If your feeling crabby, this place will put you in a good mood."
1,Great food!  Been going for many years and love the food.
0,"Worst club I've been to in LV... The promoter did a switched and bait on us with everything... We waited 2.5 hours in line from 930 on the guest list with a party of 18 all the guys had to pay 40 dollars to get in and girls didn't get the free drinks.. I would have been fine with paying just the time we waited was for nothing... Worst part everyone else got in before us... \n\nWe Couldn't even walk without being pushed by staff or people this place was way over capacity... Take your business to xs, marquee or lax I've had a great time in those places..."
1,"definitely a chill spot inside the cosmopolitan. loved the amount of seating available. me, justin b, and a couple of friends were able to relax here for a few hours while watching some sports, eating appetizers, and definitely having a few cocktails haha. was here during the afternoon so i didnt get to experience any of the live music but the next time that im in town and not wanting a full-on clubbing experience, i will have to come by to Book & Stage. \n\nthe servers were super efficient and always came by to get drink/food orders from us. garlic fries, fried mac 'n cheese, and the chicken wings were all tasty and just good snack items to munch on. drink prices werent too inflated either. me and justin b. had about 3 drinks each plus 2 shots and my bill was about $96 - nothing TOO outrageous espcially for vegas. another thing i loved was that i've been to other sportsbook bars before and they would continually pressure us to order more and more drinks/food in order to save our seats - there was none of that here. we were able to leisurely enjoy our time here and watch tv and they werent eager to usher us out just b/c we werent ordering enough."
0,"My family wanted to eat a good and cheap Christmas dinner as we were going to hit the buffets the next day. Known for the prime rib and steak and egg specials, Victorian Cafe was our destination that cold Christmas night. We got there around 9:30 PM and although there were a few empty tables, we were seated about ten minutes after we got there. Something about having to wait for the waitress to seat us. \n\nAnyway, I scanned the Yelp reviews on what was good, and decided to go with their prime rib special, which is usually $12.99 but on that day, was raised to $13.99. Too bad the steak and egg special is valid only after 11 PM. Each prime rib special comes with a salad or soup and fries, mashed potatoes or a baked potato. And of course, the table gets a basket full of hot rolls and butter. \n\nThe salad and rolls were delicious, but we all wanted to save our appetites for the prime rib. (We all ordered the same thing, haha). The prime rib comes out a while later, which made us all think that ... man, they must have run out of prime rib, so they're cooking us some good fresh one! When it arrived, each one was pretty darn big. Mine was a little bigger than the size of my hand! Unfortunately, the prime rib tasted really weird. It didn't even taste like meat! I felt like I was chewing on some weird variation of prime rib (almost like a vegetarian prime rib). It tasted like an imitation, and not at all like how prime rib usually tastes. Needless to say, my family and I were all very disappointed. We had to force the prime rib down, and this was the first time we actually had food left on our plates that we did not take back in a to-go box. \n\nGood service, good salad and bread, but sucky prime rib! The crust was too salty and the meat was too rubber tasting. We were confused as the meat was pink - not overcooked, but just not tasting the way it should. The ambiance was nice with dim lighting and booth seating (tables as well), but that prime rib was a shame."
1,this hawaiian/korean restaurant brought me back to the local cuisine of  hawaii. I ordered the meat jun combo plate and it was good. the soy dipping sauce for the meat jun should be bottled and sold in markets. deifinitely stopping by to try the other items on the menu. The ALOHA spirit is deifinitely alive and well in las vegas..thanks to RUSSEL.
0,"I'm not at all a discerning diner, but I couldn't make it through a quarter of their greasy, yet somehow flavorless burgers. The waiter was unattentive and not at all concerned about whether our food was acceptable. I might as well have eaten the napkins. Save yourself the trip and visit a fast food restaurant for a better experience. I was really looking forward to the food, but it ended up being the worst place i've ever eaten at."
1,Wow! You know how you are constantly looking for that place!!! This is it! When you walk in you feel like you are at someone's home! Staff-uber Friendly! Atmosphere-cool but quaint! Food simple and awesome!
1,"Still on the search for great wings in this city, I found Wingettes on Yelp and decided to try it based on previous reviews. Small, clean Mom & Pop business. I ordered bone-in parmesan garlic wings, and boneless sweet chili wings to go. The woman who answered the phone was nice, and told me I can mix and match wing types/seasonings, which was nice. She told me the wings were extra big this week so they would take a little bit longer to cook (I love it when I'm surprised with larger than average meat!). \n\nWhen I arrived I was promptly and courteously greeted, and the owners struck up a conversation. I asked for my wings crispy and they were cooked perfectly crispy on the outside, moist and juicy  and perfectly done on the inside. They serve fresh wings, not frozen, which makes a difference in the flavor I think. Best wings I've had in Phoenix so far. Great food, appropriate prices, friendly service. Thanks Wingettes, I will be back!"
1,"Passed by many times, but finally I made it in. Glad I did.\nUncle Ted was there, schooling an employee, from the sound of it. Not harshly,but in a fatherly way. Then an old friend (evidently) came in and it sounded like I was on the set of \""Goodfellas \"".\nThe waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered a half chicken with beans and rice. It was delicious. The price, around $10, was fair. When I paid for my meal, I asked if they had plans to offer gluten free bread ( no gluten for me) and the gentleman told me they had thought about it but price and quality was an issue - he informed me that ANY sandwich could be had SANS bread. There's my solution. Easy squeezy.\nSo, the chicken and sides were great, the price fair, and the overall experience was pleasant. Plenty of seating, inside and out.\nI'd definitely go back,  the menu offers many choices. 4 stars."
0,"I found myself singing the tune of \""That don't impress me much\"" in my mind during my food session.\n\nI tried the lasagna pizza at their suggestion as this was my first time and they had quite a few ready made pizzas available by the slice.\n\nThe toppings were great, the concept of lasagna style topped pizza is a great concept!\nHowever where they fail miserably is the crust. The pizza crust is thin, limp, flavorless and soggy which does not support the toppings. \n\nI don't want anything that is limp in my mouth, especially when it comes to pizza! The crust was just bad, bad and more bad. No happy ending here :(\n\nHit it and quit it, I am done!"
1,Food is full of flavor. I am in love with this spot. You can tell they cooked the food with love despite it being fast food. I will definitely be revisiting this spot when i'm in this area!!!
1,"Me  and my friends didn't want to wait in the line that was 1 hour + across the street so we came here for brunch. I got their banana crepes and  and my friends had their eggs benedict along with some bloody marys and mimosas. We all thought the food was pretty good. The drinks were so so, but i don't think they are known for their bloodies. Service was good and we sat outside which was nice. Overall we all liked it"
0,For $20 food I would rather go to Thai BBQ. The servings here are to small for the price.
1,"We were excited to see a new Mexican establishment open in Southside. Not a fan of the current chain restaurant I'm South Side.\n\nUpon walking in, there is not a whole lot of decor, which is disappointing for me. I love Mexican establishments, not just for food but for ambience. (They just opened, so hopefully this will change.)\n\nThe waiter brought chips and salsa. The chips were crispy, which I like, and the salsa was tasty. Had just a little kick to it.\n\nWe ordered the choribacon cheese fries as an appetizer.  I could eat these all day long. Fries, bacon, chorizo, and cheese....how can you go wrong?\n\nWe ordered the enchiladas mexicanas and the molcajete fajita as our entrees.  The enchiladas mexicanas consisted of 6 enchiladas (2 beef, 2 cheese, and 2 chicken), beans, rice, guacamole, and pic de gallo. Every bite was as good as the next. Half of each enchilada had the red sauce and the other half had the green sauce.  It was heaven in my mouth.\n\nThe molcajete fajita consisted of steak, chicken, chorizo, and shrimp cooked with pineapple, peppers, and tomatoes. This entree also came with beans, rice, guacamole, and poco de gallo. Again, every bite was delicious. Everything is seasoned to perfection. \n\nIt was lunch when we ate and I'm not sure if the bar is open, but we will be back to try the bar. With the food being so tasty, I can only imagine what a margarita will taste like. \n\nAside from the lacking decor that I deducted a star for, this place is a must try!"
1,"My wife and I ate here twice during our most recent trip to Las Vegas.  Yes, this restaurant is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory.  We both loved this restaurant.  If you're looking for a great place with some great food for a great price, you will not be disappointed here.  Like the Cheesecake Factory, there are lots of options for everyone on the menu.  The portion sizes are really good.  You'll get enough food, don't worry.  The free bread was really good.  It was a kind of wheat bread as well as some sourdough.  Loved them both.  Below is a list of what we tried:\n\nPenne alla Vodka:  this isn't on the menu but my wife asked for this instead of the gnocchi with vodka sauce.  It was excellent.  One of the best we've had and we've had a lot.  This is one of my wife's favorite pasta dishes and she loved it.\n\nCaeser salad:  Excellent as well.  Great portion size.\n\nChicken and Shrimp Jambalaya:  Really good flavor.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nPasta Tropheo (or something like that) with chicken:  Also very very good.  Delicious.\n\nDuring our trip, we ate at several Italian places, and we both though the bread and pasta here were better than those other straight up Italian places.  Sadly, if we were staying closer to the Venetian, we might have eaten here a third time.\n\nIf you're debating, give it a try.  Also, we never had to wait for a table."
0,"Da Vang (pronounced yah yang) is a hole in the wall in a sketchy ass strip mall next to the latin strip club and the Vietnamese Boba Tea shop. Weeknights and Weekends alike, this place is packed to the gills with Asian families, Mexicans from the neighborhood, and the few rogue gays and hipsters who wander in to try something ironic or obscure. Then you have the old Mexican ladies who walk by every table and put a car air freshener on it with a note explaining that you can buy it from her for $1. There are countless flies, the place hasn't been cleaned since Jesus was alive, and the parking lot almost requires four wheel drive. There isn't a more third-world dining experience in Phoenix.\n\nMy initial inpression was that this would be a fantastic trip to a Vietnamese wonderland. Seeing the types of people eating here, the extensiveness of the menu, and the overall ruggedness of it probably meant it was legit. I'm not Vietnamese, Asian, or any shade of yellow, but I like to think I still know my food well enough to say that it was an absolute let down. I ordered one of the most basic dishes, Pho Tai which is a beef broth with rice noodles and sliced beef. It's typically served with jalapeno rings, bean sprouts, basil, and lemon wedges on the side, yet mine was minus the jalapenos and lemon. Each table of Asian people who ordered the same thing both before and after me, received the said items with their meal. After my plate of half the veggies I need arrived, they brought by our spring rolls. Again, total disappointment. The sauce which accompanied them tasted like pure Hoisin, and I much prefer the typical peanut sauce or even a fish sauce. My girlfriend's bowl of Bun looked like the noodles were garbage, and was extremely short on veggies and meat. \n\nOur server was nice enough, and rather typical of a restaurant of this type. They don't speak much, their way of asking if you'd like to order is saying \""are you done?\"" After a while though, I realized he was a Spanish speaker, and then I realized he was of hispanic heritage, nice. I come to this Vietnamese place and there are Mexicans working both front and back of the restaurant. Made me want some enchiladas. Overall, this restaurant was a complete let down and if it hadn't been for the very low price (under $20 for two people) I'd have been very upset. I'll keep sticking with Little Saigon, Pho Thanh, Koai Hoan, and Dong A."
0,"This club sucks, they advertise a hip hop room, but guess what you cannot get into the hiphop room unless you buy bottle service which amounts to $450 for 4 people and one 1/2 liter of liquor. But if you want to come in and hear techno its $20. (This is straight from the mouth of the bouncer at the front) Maybe its me but sounds racist and it is a stereotypical rule, that should not be allowed in a buisiness establishment. Why can't my $20 admission allow me to attend the hiphop room, maybe because the word hiphop attracts more african-americans. Things that make you go hmmm."
0,I was so excited to get a shave I walked in & the lady working there did not even know I was there.when I asked about the shaves she didn't know anything & I made a appointment for Monday & the barber doesn't work on Monday so why make a appointment for me then?????
0,I have seen every Cirque show on the strip and this was my least favorite.   There was no story line to follow and absolutely no element of surprise which I always find in Cirque show.   This show was basically consist of old tricks from other shows strung together and quite boring.
0,I came here because of Cake Boss & knew for sure I had to try the lobster tails. It's definitely a popular place but the wait is not too long. Grab and number and take a look around. There's a big glass so you can see the workers working in the inside. Seats are limited so grab them quick.  \n\nIn the end I got a Lobster Tail & a Mini Cannoli. I'd say skip this place. The pastries were nothing special...I actually wish I had stuck to one pastry after seeing the quality of the goods.
0,"I am not a real big fan of fast-food type coffee houses. I think they are overpriced and I prefer the taste of my coffee at home. Nonetheless, there are times when you are out and you need caffeine fix and all there is is Starbucks. \n\nI always order a latte. It is the simplest, cheapest option besides regular coffee, which for me always tastes kind burnt. When I was younger, and did not care about calorie count, I would order the mocha Frappuccino. Alas, I prefer to eat my calories. \n\nThis location has been renovated, and it is much nicer and airier that before. They also have a nice patio outside for people watching (and to laugh at people going the wrong way, 4th street is one way guys)."
1,This place rocks great sushi. They make it how you want it and fill this big boy up. I have never had a bad experience here. Must try the popcorn lobster roll. IT WILL ROCK YOUR WORLD!!! Btw if you come before 12 just call to make sure they are open.
1,"One of the, if not, THE BEST video game store in town.  Definitely worth the drive coming from Scottsdale.\n\nThe Gaming Zone is exactly what their name is.  Very real and unbiased employees, a good selection of used retro titles, and a very clean place that holds tournaments and just plain fun.  Wide selection of video games to play on the spot.\n\nTrading in games for either cash and/or credit is very fair and down to earth.  Unlike other re-sellers or video game stores, The Gaming Zone will give you fair deals for the games you want to sell.  Never had to return a used item from these guys.\n\nOverall, this place is a solid store with solid service and a solid selection.  Did I mention there is an arcade section full of some child hood memories?"
0,"For being open less than a week, this restaurant is horrible. 6 hostesses at the front telling us it is a 45min wait only to be seated in a restaurant that is only 1/3 full. The meal took an insane amount of time to be brought to us only to have soggy luke warm fries. Sushi was average but not memorable. Dessert (a small mousse cup) took nearly 15 min to be served and STILL had a shortbread cookie in it in spite of us being told it was the only gluten free dessert and us making it clear we needed it without the cookie. Since we had to leave (since the whole meal took twice as long as necessary) The waitress merely suggested it be removed from the bill since it could take another 20 minutes to put mousse in a 2in cup. Absolutely absurd. Looking around the restaurant at any time one saw waiters just loitering around....so they are clearly not under staffed on the floor , maybe the issues stem from the kitchen that isn't even prepared to serve to a restaurant less than half full. I won't bother returning."
1,"Toys4Smiles is probably my favorite local non-profit. They're always friendly, and the work they do is important and fun."
0,"WATCH OUT!  \n\nKeep a close eye on your receipt and keep your signed receipt.  Case in point, I dined there with friends and we split the bill.  I gave money to my friend and they left the tip on their bill (large bill for the table).  The waitress mixed up the receipts and he signed mine and vice versa.  Nikko knows that they made the mistake but they will not fix it.  They want my friend that lives out the country to call them and pay them the money to fix the mistake.  Ridiculous! Food is overpriced and customer service stinks worse than a piece of sushi left in a hot car.\n\nNikko you have now lost a loyal customer and all of my friends...I will NEVER dine there again on principle that you refuse to make things right.  \n\nInstead of Nikko...I recommend Pisces Sushi in the metropolitan or Ru San's.  Try the tempura fried oreo's at Pisces...delicious!"
1,My wife and I just had breakfast / lunch there and it was awesome. I had the fried chicken and waffles and she the the soul food lunch. The chicken was done perfectly and I added a touch of their homemade hot sauce which is great. Will definitely be going back.
0,"Service started out okay, but after we were served it went down hill. No water refills and after asking twice for a fork and napkins we still never got them. I wanted to like this place because of the good reviews but the service ruined it for us. We were never asked if we needed anything, we just sat there waiting for them to come to our table and towards the end we got what we needed by waving at them. Will not be back."
1,"Stayed here on business late last year and my company will be using the same hotel in a few a month or so which reminded me to write a review.\n\nAs others have mentioned, this is an excellent hotel for buiness. It's very close to the Convention Center and it's got easy access to main roads if you need to get around town quickly like I do when I'm there on business.\n\nThe lobby, bar, elevators and rooms were all excellent. The only reason I wouldn't rate it 4 stars is because the location does not lend itself well to anything other than business in town."
1,I purchased a groupon for a dozen cupcakes and decided to use it for a dinner party. I called and placed the order and was told I could get 2 flavors. I asked the girl for the best sellers. She informed me that it was the Samoa and Salted Caramel. I noticed on the reviews the Caramel was very dense but I ordered the 2 flavors anyway. \n\nThe cupcakes were a hit. I loved both flavors. I even purchased an extra cupcake because they looked so good when I went to pick up my order. I got the Sugar Cookie Peanut Butter. It was huge. I split it with my son and it was very good. I must say they are not as pretty as Sprinkles but the flavor makes up for it. I will be back to try every flavor.
1,Been to this restaurant quite a few times. Always great food and great service. Top marks :)
0,"I came to this location to eat lunch with my girlfriend 3 days ago. We were both craving some good mexican food and thought we found a good spot. Unfortunately not. \n\nDIdn't start off bad, we were seated quickly and brought chips, salsa and drinks. Right after this our server, a lady with a southern accent, came to ask if we were ready.. nope needed a few more minutes. She must have come back only 30 seconds later. Talk about annoying. \n\nSo we got our order in and started with chicken tortilla soup. It was okay.\nWe got our food in a reasonable amount of time. But then realized we had no silverware, so we stole some off of another table. No big.. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered 2 enchiladas and was only able to eat 1/4 of one before she started feeling sick and has felt sick since this meal. No appetite, nauseous, stomach pains and more. Which makes us feel it was food poisoning. \n\nI ordered a carne asada bowl special. 20 minutes later, two empty glasses and still no check up from our server. We finally decide to just get up and go to the front. The lady at the counter looked puzzled at why we came to pay empty handed and informed her that we hadnt seen our server since we got our food. \n\nNeedless to say we will NEVER be back & will be sure to warn everyone we know."
0,"Tire replacement, was told it would take about 1.5 hours (when I had an existing appointment). It's almost been 2.5 hours and I'm still waiting. Ridiculous."
1,"Came here for the flashlight tour which was very interesting, could have had some more wildlife out for people to see but very cool.  Don't come here during the middle of the day it's HOT!"
0,"This place is awful for multiple reasons:\n1. Food - bland, under cooked, unoriginal. I ordered yucca fried which tasted like freezer burn. They were mushy and undercooked. The tacos were lackluster too. Chicken tinga was dry and portobello mushroom was slimy and not seasoned at all. Totally gross. Not worth any money. This place should honestly shut down based on food alone.\n\n2. Service - how long does it take to bring out water? 15 minutes apparently. It's slow, which is incredibly surprising given how empty the place is. The waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted a second drink. I would've said no bc my first was gross.\n\nThis place is worse than a college dining hall. Food is gross, service is slow, I'm never coming back and openly hating on this place via yelp."

0,"I hovered between 2 and 3 stars and finally settled on 2 stars cause well, no one likes to feel ignored and brushed off!!!\nIt was the grand opening party for Union Barrelhouse and the place was hopping!!!  A fantastic sign for any opening of a restaurant!!!  My son and I were greeted warmly at the door and being Yelpers, were presented with a gift bag at the door (thanks!)  then we sampled their grilled chicken with mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich which was delish.  We got there at 7pm, they must have had an opening for VIP guests cause even though the event invite said 7pm till close, when we got there a little before 7pm, 95% of the complimentary sampling were gone.  \nNO BIG DEAL- we werent' there just for the free food, we came to support this restaurant (must be the same owner as Salty Senorita) so after we greeted fellow Yelpers Irene V., Laura I, Travis B., and the gang, my son and I looked for a patio table cause we wanted to sit down and have dinner. \nZzzzzz as in the place was buzzing but our waitress was not to be found.  Finally I accosted one and she told me she would be right with me . . . 15 mins later . . . no big deal- there was soccer on tv so we watched the game . . . when she came, we ordered our food- kid's meal chicken tenders with fruit and a farm market salad . . . easy pizy order.\nThen we waited and waited- my son who was very hungry kept asking where the food was . . . I accosted my waitress and asked- she said it would be right up.\n(As in, palm in face- don't talk to me, can't you see I'm busy??)  I was understanding- I mean, the place was packed!!!\nWe waited sooooo long that in between waiting my son had time to enter a grilled cheese eating contest where he had 5 minutes to eat 9 grilled cheese sandwiches (which by the way, was very fun)- I don't know how long the contest took- 30 mins?  \nBy the time we got back to our table, our food was still not ready!!!  10 mins later the food comes, the waitress hurriedly throws the food down on the table and just runs away . . . I didn't even get the chance to tell her she gave my son tater tots instead of the fresh fruit side he ordered.  Finally I had to chase her down and accost her again and she said, \""oops, I'll bring it right out . . . \""\n30 mins later we were still waiting!!!  My son kept asking where his fresh fruit was.\nFinally I chased her down and accosted her AGAIN and this time I asked her to talk to the manager to comp'd our meal for the evening.\nThis is the first time ever in my prolific string of dining experiences where I had to consistently chase down the server- I might have logged a 1/4 of a mile chasing her down!!!  You get the picture.\nThe manager came and was very friendly and apologetic and willingly comp'd our meal.  \nIn terms of pricing, it was $10 for my salad which was medium sized portion, fresh, loved the balsamic vinegarette reduction but I thought it was a bit pricey for the portion and atmosphere of the place.  The chicken tender kid's meal pretty ordinary- nothing to write home about.\nAtmosphere is great, food ordered okay, service received epic fail.  Manager very understanding and friendly.  Not sure I would come back again."
0,"How ridiculous, soft opening? Looked at website after I got there, it says they open at 4pm and sign on door says they open at 5pm. They need to figure this out, maybe I'll think about coming back. But with the reviews so far, doesn't seem like anyone should bother to waste time and money."
1,A different style (love or hate) pizza. A square cut thicker crust with cold shredded cheese on top. It's different enough that it is a good chance of pace to your standard pie.
0,"If I could give a negative review I would. I went in to get all you can eat. Food isn't half bad, but the service is horribly slow. And honestly, for ayce, speed is of the essence. I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes for a few rolls of my first round. I've been waiting over 25 freaking minutes and some rolls still haven't come. \n\nWhat gives?\n\nEdit: they finally came. 30 minutes later. Really? For salmon rolls?"
0,"I  called for a pizza for take out. I was told it would be 45 minutes! Too long. The pizza crust & sauce has NO taste!! Toppings were sparse. Sorry to say that \""Pizza Hut\"" would beat this place with no problem. When I walked in to pick up the pizza, I saw a server cutting up a loaf of \""burnt\"" bread to deliver to the people eating inside the restaurant. We will not be back. No taste sause....just like Don Antonio's."
0,"I'm so sad to give them this rating. Monta has the best ramen in town, but not this monta. Their chasu was really chewy and I was surprised. The space is really small and it gets crowded. The chairs at the bar were really uncomfortable. And they seated like 3 parties before we sat down when we were there before all of them!!! I usually crave monta and love it, but it's the Eastern location that has my heart. I asked nicely if they had the chasu buns here and the lady was rude and said \""no we don't.\"" It was just a question. Anyway, probably won't be going back to this monta again. Sad because it used to be a favorite. Looks like I'll stick to the one in Henderson with nicer staff and better quality food. Ta ta for now!"
1,Free movie nights?  Rotating museum exhibits?  Architecture that resembles a space-age future world?  Free library cards with three weeks per book and a 35 (!!) book check-out limit?  Comfortable work stations?  Gorgeous views of the Phoenix skyline?  A physical size larger and more open and spacious than any university library I've ever visited?  Rare book and child play areas?\n\nPhoenix sure has done right with its library.
0,"This show is so bizarre. It tried to have a storyline, which didn't make any sense and at points was completely laughable. The dancing was like a high school cheerleader routine. Some of the dancers were amazing, the pole dancer hands down was the best part!\n\nThe person from the audience was hilarious but majorly disappointing when he turned out to be part of the show too..."
1,"Sapna. \nI wonder what that means?\nThe first thing I noticed was the bright airy space that felt like an oasis coming in from 100 degree mid afternoon weather.\nThe girl working was totally adorable and sat us down with some menus. She immediately started gushing about the lentil salad, so I didn't get much time to look closely at the menu. I was too worried about hurting her feelings NOT to order the lentil salad, so we settled on that and the eggplant panini sans cheese. \nbest.\nsalad.\never.\nExtremely fresh tasting, local greens, lentils, and other veggies in a barely there lemon vinaigrette.  And some pita on the side.\nThe panini was okay. Yummy rustic whole wheat bread.\nAs we munched, I noticed the lush little patch of garden growing by the telephone pole outside. A grip of basil just basking away in DIRECT SUNLIGHT and looking fantastic. WTF I couldn't keep mine alive for a week! \nAnyway.\nTotal for the sandwich and salad was around $14. Not mad at that.\nI'll be back for nopales and a tofu scramble breakfast burrito."
0,"They over-cooked the Halibut in the special. Four people in our party that had it, spent 2 days with GI problems. The guacamole was more like a salad, than a dip. Big chunks with no creamy goodness. The only redeeming quality was the waiter was very nice. Will not go back."
1,I just luv the food here..Its absolutely amzing !!! I have been here -3 times now and havent been disappointed even once...The enchilladas rock !!! They are closed on Sundays and coinsidently i always have a craving for their food on Sundays..I drive to Pedros on sunday afternoons forgetting they are closed...Thats how gud their food is !! Trust me !
0,Do not take your toddler here. We love Asian food and wanted to try this place very badly. I got the citrus chicken which was okay and my wife got the sesame chicken which was bland. They did bring us out a sample of their Miona chicken which was very good. The strange part was my 20 month old daughter was fascinated by the waterfall display and wanted to check it out next thing you know they are giving us a togo menu saying our daughter cant sit still and next time we should order to go ? It was the strangest thing we have experience at a restaurant with our daughter. THREE times they told us to order TO GO next time. We felt that our daughter who was well behaved was not wanted in the restaurant. After this experience and the so so food we will not be back.
1,Very cool and different place! Waffles and hot dogs or both. I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing! They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on/in it. My favorite is peanut butter and honey. Great price and quick service. Definitely will be going back!
1,I have taken my dog Stella here I think three or 4 times.  I love the owner and anyone I have come in contact with.  Stella is happy to be there.
0,"I was here for a one day conference. I live locally and wasn't renting a room. When I arrived the morning of the conference, I explained to hotel staff that I needed a private place with an electrical outlet to breast pump intermittently throughout the day. Morning staff were accommodating, and I was allowed to use an empty board room on morning break and during my lunch break. During my 15 minute afternoon break, the board room was being used and shift change had occurred, so I had to explain my situation to a new staff member. She was polite but unhelpful. She told me there was nowhere in the building for me to pump. I suggested someone's office, and she said no. I had previously been informed all of the hotel rooms were booked, so I suggested they allow me to use one that was between guests. She allowed me to use a smoking room. The room was a cloud of smoke. By the time I was allowed access to the room, found it, and pumped, I was late returning to my conference. I also reeked like cigarettes the rest of the day."

1,"I haven't met a drink or food item on the menu that I didn't like at Pinky's. This has become a tradition for my boyfriend and I to come at least once a month.

I live on the west side not far from Pinky's and it's awesome that we have something so cool on \""the big scary side of town.\"" If you've never been here, you're missing out!"

Do NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE! the best part\nWas that the.manager came by and took our plates away and did not \nCharge us for the food.............be careful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
0,Average sandwich place. Sub-par service. Why on earth would someone want to talk to a rude employee only to then wait 10 minutes for a sandwich. If you ask me there are far better options in town.
1,"happy hour from 12pm-7pm was the best on the south side of the strip! The waitresses are hot, the drink deals are top notch and every hour they change via 'The Wheel' which some cute girl spins. My boyfriend and I spent at least the first 1-3 hours of our afternoon here on several different days. \n\nI've seen other reviews from women on this place about being ignored at the bar or sitting without a refill. I think this is just jealousy, the waitresses are beautiful but I am a perfectly straight woman and I got great service here, every time!\n\nTry the Calamari, for 12$, it's a meal for two!"
0,"Well, I said I would try it again. Had a slice and another genos famous cheese steak.\nSaying the pizza didnt have much cheese on it is an understatement. Shameful. I dont know how you could serve that and be proud of it. The cheese steak was the same. No meat and hard uncooked onions for 7.00 just the sandwich, no side. \nI really like to support local businesses, as I am a business owner myself.\nWe will not go back."
1,"They are 3 weeks in and amazing. I went in the morning because I knew it wouldn't be busy. We were seated at a booth and got really good service from the staff, there's also free wifi, which helped me Yelp about this place! \n\nI ordered the chicken parm, caprese salad, and my parents ordered the meatball sub. The chicken parm & meatball sub was just alright...but the rest was delicious. For dessert, the famous XL lobster tail and tiramisu--both were to die for. \n\nIn general, the salads and buddy's favorite are good. \n\nCocktails are not that great, I say pass on them! Do not order anything more expensive than 20 dollars! Look above for recommended items! Honestly the food is just okay, it's good but not great! \n\nThe staff was really responsive, they talked to us all the time, it was a good customer service experience.!"

1,"Traveling from out of town and took the kids to this place.  Overall, we had a great experience here.  Keeping it from a 5 star is the price - just felt it was a little pricey for what we got but not totally unreasonable.  This is a chain that just opened  a location in ATL and we will return.\n\nKobe burger was fantastic.  Truffle fries a little disappointing but not bad.  Service overall was really good - fast and friendly.  Bartender was totally swamped and a little grouchy but no big deal.\n\nWe were staying at a hotel across the street and there is a great tunnel that goes to the Mall so you don't have to play Frogger with the traffic - bonus!\n\nOf all the restaurant choices in this Mall thought it was the best for a fairly quick meal with the kids.  There were lots of families with kids while we were there."
0,"Ordered two hot dogs (big mistake) and ended up putting one in the fridge in the hotel room.\n\nOpened the fridge a few hours later to discover a very odd smell coming from it. Was hoping to eat it for breakfast the next morning before checkout, but ended up trashing it instead.\n\nThat pretty much sums up my experience with Pink's. A great big MEH."
0,"I think this is not a new buffet in town!! I just went there on Thanksgiving day, which is not the first Thanksgiving day. OMG I have to wait for 5 hours to be seated. Unprofessional management, there are a lot of table empty but no one clean it, so there are only 70% can provide to customers. 30% left unattended. \n\nThey charge for $10.- extra for Thanksgiving but no sign posted. \n\nThere have only 2 staffs working for almost 500 customers. Those 2 staffs served only their \""DIAMOND\"" guest. The rest, just keep waiting, they don't care!!! \n\nWhen I complain to one of their staff, she complain to manager, who standing and do nothing, I just got bluffs back that he will kick me out from the hotel!!! WTF \n\nHe treated his staff better than his customers.\n\nThe food is great!! but I lost my appertise already."
1,"I will give the Summit Diner a 4 star. I really think 3 1/2 would be more appropriate. \nIt was the first time we visited the place and since its like 6 minutes from where we live it was time to try it for breakfast. \nGood reception, friendly. The interior is busy. Way too busy, too many signs and different nooks.2 tv's on sport channels.  Maybe it's more suitable for night dining but in the morning it makes you somewhat hyper. But all customers were almost same age (60's)\nThe menu seems to be extensive and I do not know if that is a good thing. \nWe decided to go with a simple and comfortable eggs and meat breakfast. We thought if that was good it would be a start. Believe me there are places who cannot deliver decent eggs and bacon. \nCoffee: very weak. No special coffees to get. Just what they have on tap. We are used to Nespresso, so even before we leave the house for breakfast we have a good coffee. \nTwo scrambled eggs (looked more than 2 eggs)with bacon (plenty) and a lot of pretty good hash browns, no toast. \nTwo eggs over easy with 3 sausage links and hash browns, toast. \nIt was honest fare. Nothing special but well served and the waitress and waiter came to check on us a few times. \nWhy 4 stars: location is convenient, food was ok. Service was good. People are nice."
1,"Located just west of Las Vegas Blvd on Sahara near the Red Label Lounge, this Capriotti's location is easily accessible from the strip. The shopping plaza that it sits inside of might make you raise an eyebrow, but it's actually a pretty nice nice place inside and the staff is all all very friendly.\n\n They have vegetarian offerings on the menu that don't feel like a meat sandwich minus the meat (the vegetarian cheese steak is my favorite) so it's quickly become my favorite place to grab a quick bite for lunch."
0,"Just your average Walgreens store, with much higher prices.\n\nOn a Las Vegas business trip, this was near my hotel. After sleeping, watching TV, and eating \""all you can eat sushi\"" for the most of the afternoon and evening, I quickly ran over here to ensure I had breakfast and snacks for the week. Actually, I didn't run. I sort of walked and stopped every once in a while when I was short of breath. \n\nAnyway, I purchased premade turkey sandwiches, Little Debbie Swiss Cake Rolls, Pringles, bottled water, Gatorade, chocolate covered pretzels, and yogurt covered raisins. Clearly, I am training hard to make millions as a football player. I am on the JaMarcus Russell diet.\n\nIn the end, I don't understand how this Walgreens feel it can sell certain items at ridiculously high prices that border on criminal. Seriously, why is prostitution is against the law in Las Vegas, while rape is so clearly legal."
0,This place is outrageously priced. I went on a date there at about 6pm this past Saturday. We bowled 2 games...the total was almost $40. This is unacceptable prices for a bowling alley. I also ordered 1 beer and that was almost $8. No wonder there was only like 4 people in the entire alley. I will not be returning.
1,"Phoenix is lucky to have a theater like this, and by that I mean one that brings in the documentaries, foreign films, and award nominees that don't get play in the regular multiplexes.\n\nSure, other towns sometimes have one art theater that will play a limited selection of these movies, but to have a multi-screen theater that runs these films continuously throughout the year is just a treat and Harkin's Theatres should be commended for making this available.\n\nYes, it's a little dated inside, and I do wish they had stadium seating, but those are minor complaints. In fact, I'm old enough to remember going to see Tron when it was first released in 1982 at the Camelview (before the mall even had another theater) and I loved the theater then and I still love it today.\n\nI certainly hope the rumors that this theater will be demolished to make room for more mall expansion are just rumors because the Camelview Theater is a shining point of light for cinephiles in the Valley and it deserves to remain so."
1,The closest u can get here for an authentic italian pizza... Be aware u may not like it if u think u r getting lot of cheese of ingredients... But that is the italian way
1,"It was my first time using a moving company to move my stuffs, and I have to say I picked the right place! I needed help moving the next day and most of the moving companies told me they did not have anyone that can work next day and some were overpriced!. After searching for awhile and I found Christopher Moving on yelp and decided to call. The representative was very nice and helped me make an appointment for the next day. She told me 2 guys and a truck will come around 11am- 1pm (she was being honest and told me the guys might be early or might be little late because they had to help move right before me and doesn't know if it will take longer or not) and I was fine with that! Next day, 3 guys came at 11:30 and told me they had an extra person to help for free! I was very happy with that because they didn't charge me extra and I wanted the moving to be done within 2 hours so that I don't need to pay more. The moving went smoothly and the guys were awesome! They finished just in time. All three of them were very hard working, which I appreciate:) Overall, I this company was great and will use this company again for my future move!"
1,"Great food, amazing mojitos. Busy location. On a Friday or Saturday you better have reservations. The bar seating area is very noisy with a lot of people walking all around you. This location is best enjoyed midweek in the dining area. Can't think of a better place for a Tuesday date night."
0,"Let me begin by saying that I am not a food snob by any means. I was with my husband looking for some chinese food after a movie and we decided on this place. Upon walking in I was not impressed. Very run down. The people were friendly so we sat down. The seats in the booth were all ripped up. My husband and I got up to survey the food and all I can say is that it all looked questionable. The \""hibachi\"" consisted of a bunch of raw chicken, shrimp, beef and vegetables sitting out on trays on melted ice. So you're supposed to pile up what you want on a plate and walk into the kitchen and give it to the \""chef\"" to cook. WHAT? ok...the sushi is nothing but imitation crab rolled in rice and the rest of the food was just questionable looking. NEVER coming back here again. I don't understand what the other reviewers are talking about...my husband and I walked out."
1,"Amazing food, the kind of place that knows you by name ( certainly me, I eat their food every week, usually more than once!), and they aren't afraid to bring the heat. I go between Thai hot and a 4/5 ( I notice that it's hotter when I'm in person), and can't go wrong with the pad siew, pad thai, or any of the curries ( the panang is stellar). Oh, and they deliver!"
0,"I have been to various Great Clips before but never to this location until today.   After I was asked how I wanted my hair and I gave her the name a of men's hairstyle (an undercut with a #1 on the sides and back). The \""stylist\"" started about cutting my hair and never asked questions, so I assumed she understood.  When it was clear she had no clue what she was doing and/or what I had asked for, I stopped her.  She gets offended when I ask her if she even understood what I wanted.  She proceeds to tell me about how she's been cutting hair for over 20 years and implies I'm an idiot.  Not only that but the other woman working in the place chimes in as well telling me I didn't ask for an undercut and that it's a woman's hairstyle blah blah blah.  I proceed to literally explain to them how to cut a men's undercut, how to part the hair, that it's not blended, etc.  So anyway, up until now I was the only customer in the place.  After people came in I felt extremely embarrassed to say anything else so I just let this \""stylist\"" finish whatever it was she thought she was supposed to be doing to my hair.  Needless to say, I went home straightaway and shaved my head.  \n\nLong story short... the employee's here are rude, unprofessional, and not very well trained.  I would give them 0 stars if possible.  Go someplace else!!!"
0,"With first impression, this place seemed like a great choice. Good food selections and okay prices. However, make sure you have plenty of time for the chefs and waitresses to delay your day. \n\nWe had a group of 9 and we all ordered fairly simple stuff. I had the deluxe mixed fry combo which was a decent deal. After i finished my meal, 30 minutes~ we are still waiting for 3 entrees to be served. How hard is it to make 2 tonkotsu wiyh rice and a rainbow roll? It ended up late by 1 hour.... Most people would have left or canceled by then but its hard to move a wheelchaired grandparent to another food place. \n\nTheres also other tables that ordered much later than us that are getting their tonkotsu. They didnt forget, because i reminded them every 15 minutes. Its funny because everyone else has finished their meal and im here sitting in the restaurant typing this review. \n\nThe food itself was decent. Everyone was well made but theres nothing to write home about. Free green tea as well. If service wasnt bad, this would be a 3.5 star. \n\nAnother thing to watch out for, the reviews here are highly inflated, you get 10% off for writing a review for them while youre there. \n\nDont come here unless you want to start with lunch and end with dinner."
0,"Went here with a party of five for my daughter's graduation. Our server did not seem very comfortable with the menu. He did not offer much in the way of ordering suggestions. We started out with both cold and hot tapas. The croquetas were excellent. The scallops were just ok. The tuna tartare was very fishy and did not appear fresh. The fried artichoke tapas was very good. The olives with cheese and serrano ham was tasty.  The spicy shrimp were very fishy, not spicy, and in a poor sauce. I had a chicken in a chorizo tomato sauce entree. The pieces of chorizo were tasty. In the dish which was small, there were three chicken wings and another piece on the bone. A very unimpressive dish. Another chicken entree was said to be dry. .The desserts were very small and not homemade. Overall, the meal was disappointing. Overall, not a great experience. We will not be going back."

0,"I actually fell asleep at one point.\n\nWhat the Hell did I just see?  This was not the show I expected.  My wife was so excited about seeing Jubilee.  The last old Vegas showgirl revue.  Instead, we got a metaphysical acid trip that basically told us the classic show was out dated, so they changed it.\n\nThe beginning, which was classic, was great.  The ending, which was revamped classic was great.  It was the 60% of stupid stuff in between that was boring enough to put me to sleep.  Essentially, a personified Jubilee dances for the audience, until she falls down in pain because her act is out of date.  A disembodied voice explains that Vegas has changed, and she must travel back in time to Samson and Delilah, and the Titanic to learn....something?  Between the acts are unrelated, incomprehensible dance routines.\n\nOK, lets break this down.  The old show if out of date, so travel back in time to become more modern.  Acid trip anyone?  The acts were cheesey and nonsensical.  The plot sounded like a bad Cirque du Soliel reject.  \n\nSaving graces?  A talented bunch of dancers, and incredible costumes.  Look, the plot is the directors fault.  But, the dancers were as good as I expected.  And the costumes were great.  So, kudos to the dancers and designers.  Unfortunately, your director and writer let you down.  I left feeling kinda cheated by the whole experience."
1,"Very fun place!  Vegan ice cream is such a novel idea, and they do it well.  I had the chai tiramisu tSoynami and my sister had the almond oy vey.  It was my birthday, so she let me swap with her because I liked hers a lot better!"
1,One of my favorite place when it comes to seafood. I have tried many things on the menu but I have to say my all time favorite are the fish tacos! I have tried the aguachile and it is good I personally would of liked it more spicy and some more avocado which traditionally comes with. The micheladas are     Pretty darn good. If your up for trying something outside the box try the camarones culichi.
0,"After walking around Chandler Mall for a couple hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find this boba shop.  But that little joy that I felt soon disappeared when I placed my order.  First of all, the location is terrible.  There's a giant pillar in front of the store which causes all sorts of confusion.  People standing around looking at the menu, people waiting in line, and people waiting for their drink, all cluster around this pillar, making you wonder if the person you've been standing behind is even going to place an order.  The extremely lengthy menu doesn't help this at all as people, new or familiar with boba take forever to decipher this menu.  The girls working at the store don't offer any help when customers seem completely befuddled by the menu but seem like they themselves need help trying to figure out how to make the drinks we've ordered.  It's not uncommon to wait 10 minutes for your drink while they let one of the drinks sit behind the counter as the ice melts and they make every drink in every other order.  I'm trying to be forgiving because they're new and probably haven't fully trained all their staff but maybe train the newbies on weekdays, not the weekends?  I've tried to like this place given the convenient location, but I won't be stopping by again."
1,"I've found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas!  \n\nI made reservations way in advance for a friend's bachelorette party.  We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  Our servers were awesome!  Everyone was super nice!  I had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came back with a 2nd round on him!  \n\nAll of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!  We ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  Oh, and I can't forget about their bread!  It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.\n\nAnother reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  It does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic dinner. \n\nThe only one bad thing I could even think of for STK was the single stall for the bathrooms.  Not very convenient.  But everything else was superb!"
0,"This is a review of their Afternoon Tea service.  I thought it would be fun and different to do tea in a casino, and it was, but I've definitely experienced better tea service elsewhere, emphasis on the word \""service.\""  That is what really brought this experience down.  Our server was not all that friendly, and just not around.  They were understaffed that day, but as Mel L. said, that could have been mentioned to us at the start.  Our server brought our tea out without saying a word and walked right off while I guess I wasn't paying attention, so I was sitting there for minutes not realizing that our tea had been brought out!  Usually they'll pour the first cup for you, but our server did not.  Someone also usually comes by to ask if teapot refills are needed, but no one did.  It took awhile for us to flag someone down so that we could get more hot water.  \n\nThe ambiance was different for sure, and smoky.  I thought it would be ok since we were tucked off in a corner sort of but it was pretty overwhelming.  Also, the table next to us was occupied two separate times by out-of-town senior citizen gamblers who were not discreet in looking over at our table to check the tea set-up out and who held loud conversations about us (well, our whole table spread).  Talking about us but not to us basically, fun.  (More than half the people were there for bar service rather than tea service.)\n\nAs for the tea and food, tea is tea to me lol.  It was fine.  The sandwiches here are really good.  You have your pick of I think four sandwiches if I recall correctly.  There were two categories of sandwiches (again if I recall correctly) and you could pick and choose from each.  I picked from the second category which might have been vegetarian/seafood and I really liked all of my picks.  I basically picked sandwiches whose ingredients sounded familiar because there were some doozy ingredients in the other category!  :p  As for their scones, I thought you couldn't go wrong with scones but I guess you can.  I wasn't a fan of theirs (cranberry I think?) and they were hard as a rock.  As for the desserts, I have yet to come across desserts at afternoon tea that are good.  \n\nI'm glad I tried this place out, but even though I loved their tea sandwiches I doubt I would return.  If they ever decide to move their tea service to a nicer, less smoky place in the hotel (why not facing the conservatory or the lake?) and focus solely on tea (or at least not focus on the bar and bar goers) and the whole experience (quiet, relaxing, non-smoky ambiance where people won't be staring and talking about you and your food!), I would consider returning."
1,I support local businesses and this place is a great little coffee/sandwich/salad shop. It's a father/daughter run team and they are very friendly and pleasant people. I've been in several times and haven't tried anything I didn't like. Their cookies are amazing! Atmosphere is cozy and there is a great outdoor patio area as well. You won't be disappointed.
0,"Worst Costumer service ever!!! After being on the phone for over an hour, the Representative says, \""Are you sure you have our service?\"" and then I'm \""disconnected\""!!!  Try again, start over with someone who doesn't speak English, says he will have to call me back- 1 week still waiting!  \nAlso, bill went from $37 to $67 - new Rep says to \""Cancel\"" WOW! GREAT idea!!\n\nI Give  Negative 5 Stars"
0,"Oh Hickory Tavern, why did you do this to me?  Now that I'm Yelping regularly, I come in today for lunch with the family and you completely disappoint me!  Here's the \""good\""....They had every football game imaginable on, so I was able to watch TV to distract me from the fact that the service was sub par and the food was worse.  \n\nI wasn't incredibly hungry, so I figured I'd have the small nachos.  Please sit down if you're not already, but Taco Bell has better nachos, oh yes, I said it.  Plain, barely salted nachos, diced flavorless tomatoes, sliced jalapenos, a small amount of cheese and a dollop of bad foodservice sour cream.  The chili, which I ordered on the side was equally as bad.  I tried to jazz them up with some salsa, I had to wait for 10 minutes for the waitress to materialize to ask for some.  She then disappeared for another 10 minutes and when she returned she plopped the most disgusting tasting foodservice salsa I ever had in my life in front of me with a \""sorry\"".  Very disappointing.  I also ordered an unsweetened tea, which was very watery and the fact that they charge $3.50 for a drink is insulting, but if it was good tea, I wouldn't have noticed the overcharge.  \n\nI don't know what to say, and I have been here before and it was pretty good.  Today, Hickory Tavern you failed me."
1,"I lovvvvved this show!!! It was my first show of this kind so I don't know how valid my opinion is but my bf and I came here for my bday and I loved the girls !! There was only one blonde that seemed very robotic like she was just following a routine she didn't smile at all and seemed very bland. Other then that the girls were very energetic, seemed very into the dances and kept great eye contact. The only down side is yes the chairs are so uncomfortable!! I got a seat at the end of the row so it wasn't too bad but my bf said he was soo uncomfortable it was starting to hurt towards the end. Once we got there a really old guy with all white hair asked my bf if we wanted \""VIP\"" seating or something and he tipped him a few bucks and got right in front :) one thing kinda sucked I had seen reviews that said the picture afterwards was $10 I absolutely wanted it and got it except it came out to $35!! It had a frame so I guess that's why?? Just beware its not $10 or at least wasn't when we went. Overall though I told me bf I want to come back and see them next time were in town !!"
1,"Great hidden spot in Las Vegas!  I come from a Korean and Mexican background so this place was perfect for me.  The Bulgogi, marinated beef, burrito is a all time great and is an automatic go to dish for around $5 and can usually feed you for two meals.  Another recommended item is the Daegi bulgogi, spicy pork, french fries. \n\n For those of you that have hit Robertos Tacos late night and enjoyed their super carne asada fries you will love these.  They step it up every week with new specials such as calamari tacos and bulgogi gyros so you never get bored with the menu.  The Korean street tacos blend the tastyness of Korean meats with the ease  of tacos, I recommend ordering a few at the low price of $1.29.  I could go on forever on the best items on the menu so head over and decide for yourself.\n\nIf you have friends that aren't too adventurous or little kids Komex can handle that too.  They offer sliders, french fries and other basics that are just as good.  Because this place is so good and really affordable it can get busy around peak times so don't get frustrated and recognize that if there are tons of people eating there then it must be good."
0,"Ended up in this disaster after one of our usual places was full of a tour group. It took around 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table to take our order after being sat. Little did we know this was the beginning of a pattern.My coworkers and I ordered off of the lunch menu (which for the price looks pretty good, I guess that is what gains them the one mandatory star above). Then the waiting game it took a very long time to get the food. The lunch special comes with egg and flour soup which we received first. It was bland and not very good, had to add soy sauce to it to make it even palatable. About 30 plus minutes later we received our entrees. The food was underwhelming at best. I had the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice, egg roll and Thai fried chicken wing. The chicken wing and egg roll were not too bad, but the rest was sub par and not very good. I believe I could have gotten a better meal at an Asian fast food restaurant. Then it took close to 15 minutes to get our check, followed by another long wait to get it back. It caused one of my coworkers to miss a meeting. Not sure how this place has made it as long as it has."
1,"Only stopped in for one drink, but like it enough to return to try the rest out!\n\nThe atmosphere was great, you might have to yell a little bit to be heard, but that's part of the thrill of coming here. \n\nI ended up with a seasonal brew called Odelay! which is a delicious mexican chocolate ale. If you're worried about too much sweetness, then there are no worries with this brew. Get it if you are looking for a solid dark ale. \n\nSidenote - Had I seen it, I would have gone for the beer sampler that they had. There were a ton of beers on the wood board and it looked delicious!\n\nMy partner had the Raj IPA. For those who don't drink IPA often this was a smooth one. Had a little kick, per usual of the brew, but a nice introduction to what standard IPA's taste like. In addition, the appetizers were good, but I personally found them a little flavorless. Don't get me wrong though, they were FILLING. The calamari and the spinach dip were rich, and we felt pretty full after trying both of them. A little more salt wouldn't hurt though. \n\nThis place loses a star for the service. Everyone was friendly, but our server was fairly unattached to our experience and stopped by three times total. \n\nStay tuned. I'm definitely heading back."
0,"First time going had a HORRIBLE wait time during lunch... The manager comped my food, but for a quesadilla a 30 minute wait is crazy since it's an appetizer.  I will not be going back any time soon."
1,"I am always on the lookout for brunch spots to try out. While I tend to focus on places in the Plateau and Mile End districts (mostly because I live nearby which is convenient on lazy weekends), every once in a while I will hear of a place for which I am willing to go a little further. Jason from Shut Up and Eat provided me with this gem with one of his most recent posts. As such, I hightailed it to NDG with my brunch buddy to go visit Prohibition.\n\nThis small restaurant sticks to a one page focused menu that has eclectic brunch fare. I started with the triple chocolate pretzel cookie because....well why not? Rich and gooey, just a delicious cookie. The pretzel pieces were not as plentiful as I expected but the mix of chocolates offset that nicely.\n\nMy friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and sugar bacon. The pancakes were nice and fluffy with a very strong note of lemon. I didn't expect the lemon to come out that strongly in the batter. Truly a pleasant surprise. The blueberry compote added the right level of sweetness to the dishes - maple syrup not required but still utilized. The sugar bacon was very nice as well - big thick cut bacon that is crispy and sweet at the same time.\n\nI ordered the Challah french toast and fried chicken combo. A wonderful play on the southern classic chicken and waffles. The Challah french toast brought forth a wonderful sweet and crisp exterior with a light and fluffy interior. Honestly one of the French toast plates I've ever had. The fried chicken was very well done as well. Two requirements come to mind with fried chicken. First, the batter must be seasoned properly and crispy. Second, the chicken must remain juicy. Dryness is not an option. Both requirements were nailed here. This was very good chicken which a nice balance to the sweetness of the French toast. It is a pretty heavy dish by the usual breakfast and brunch standard, so if you like a lighter meal, avoid this combo but for everyone else, you will love it.\n\nProhibition certainly brought to the table some great brunch dishes that veered away from the standard breakfast and brunch fare. The price is reasonable all things considered and unlike a lot of places nowadays, the coffee and tea is included in the meal. If you are a party larger than 2, you may end up waiting in weekends as the place is not very big but regardless, Prohibition is certainly worth a look for any brunch seeking individuals.\n\nCheers!"
0,"I visited Sammy's this past Sunday. My first impression was that it was a good place to watch sports. I was pleased that they offered Pepsi products and told the bartender that I was the designated driver as I ordered a Diet Pepsi. My friend and I went to one of several open tables.\n\nIt was a typical dive bar with great televisions. The wings were very good and our bartender was very attentive. Sadly, the waitress who came on midway through the first games completely ignored our table. My friend and I had to get our own water. \n\nI was appalled when a man (presumably the owner, who should know better) walked in smoking a cigar. The stench alone was enough to turn my stomach.\n\nI was further appalled when I saw that I had been charged for my soda and the few refills I had. Really?? Very few bars actually penalize the designated driver by even charging for one soda, much less charging that person for refills. At $2.25 each, it would have been cheaper for me to drink beer. If she had been kind enough to tell me that refills were not free, I would have ordered water as a refill. I'm surprised they don't charge for that (and they probably would if they could). I did express my surprise to the bartender and she said she had to follow the rules. Hopefully this review will have the owner revising those rules.\n\nAll in all, I will not go out of my way to go to Sammy's. I know of many other great sports bars (dives and nice pubs) who seem far more appreciative when I spend my money. \n\nHopefully the owner will extinguish his cigar before walking through his pub. And hopefully he will revise his policy of giving a designated driver a free soda for being responsible and driving drinking friends around the valley."
0,"I just opened up the $13 tights for my 4yr old. I noticed a snag on the left thigh. I called the store to see if I could come in and exchange or return them. They said that tights are considered \""final sale\"" and they can not be exchanged or returned. Beware of purchasing from stores like this. I will not be shopping here and don't recommend others unless you open up and examine your entire purchase before you go home."
0,"This review is solely based on the wings. I haven't tried anything else on the menu here yet.\n\nWe ordered the wings in three different sauces - sweet & spicy, buffalo, and garlic buffalo. It was, admittedly, a challenge ordering. There was definitely a language barrier, as well as an unfamiliarity with standard wing lingo (i.e. wet).\n\nThe breading on the wings basically ruined them entirely. It was all way too soggy. After eating a couple, they literally became inedible. However, the sauces were pretty solid. The garlic buffalo was my favorite. The regular buffalo was my least favorite. I appreciated that with each sauce, you can choose mild, medium, or hot. For example, we ordered sweet & spicy medium, buffalo hot, and garlic buffalo medium. And I liked that the medium was actually medium (if not even hot). If you don't like things spicy, definitely stick to mild only here.\n\nBut alas, it didn't matter how much I liked the sauces if I couldn't stand the wings. The sauces were good enough, though, that I would come back to try some of the other menu items that sound tasty. However, I also have to take off points for the ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces. They were downright awful. So bad that I couldn't even bare to dip the bad wings in them."
1,"It basically has everything I need when I need to buy any sport activity that I plan to take on! Bought my first bike here, scuba diving gear, my leg warmers, & a few purses & gym clothes.  Everyone in the store is so helpful and accommodating.  They are always willing to help and answer any questions I have and they are very knowledgeable with their equipment & their section.\n\nI'm even thinking to get scuba certified here in Sports Chalet, maybe one of these days I will :)"
0,"This place is probably a love it or hate it.  It's kind of a cross between Zombie and Goth.  It's pretty much a bar with a them and a small place to dance.  Not my scene but I'm sure others would like it and for a local watering hole, it adds a little variety."
0,"If you value your life, don't go to Banner Boswell.  My husband was told to go to the ER by his doctor's office.  He arrived at Boswell around 10 a.m.  He is diabetic and has heart and high blood pressure problems.  When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.    We will never go to this hospital again"
1,Great food! Just tried the new zucchini mini cakes. Yum! All their food here is so flavorful and the salad bar is always a favorite. Always leave this place satisfied!

0,"Stayed here for one night because my boyfriend and I were going to a concert at the Joint and didn't want to deal with the traffic and having to drive home (we live in Henderson, just outside of Vegas). We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. \n\nCheck-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me, James, was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv, it said their system was down, but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However, the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks, possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. \n\nThere are signs all over the casino and hotel that says \""no outside food or beverage allowed\"" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home, but once we ran out of water, we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. \n\nThe rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten, it was already about 2am. We were so tired, we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all, it is very close to the airport, so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control, but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also, in the room we had, the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. \n\nAlso, the location of this hotel is not amazing. This is a part of vegas that I would NEVER go to alone and I definitely would not recommend leaving the hotel if you decide to stay here. It is not on the strip and it's a further walk from it than you would expect. If you stay here but want to go to other casinos, you better take a cab or have a car. \n\nThe only positives about this hotel is the decor and the Joint. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from Hard Rock - modern with a punk influence and the Joint was awesome! A great intimate venue (but the drinks are extremely overpriced - $7 for a very small cheap beer like shocktop - you could buy a whole 6-pack at the CVS across the street for that much!)\n\nBasically, just don't stay here unless you're looking to party hard in your hotel and piss everyone on your floor off. The staff doesn't do anything about parties and loud music in the suites. I've had a few friends get suites just to throw parties and you can hear the music all the way down the hall, but staff never said a word to them. They obviously don't care about the customers in suites that are actually trying to get some rest at 3 in the morning."

0,Poor condition.  Greens were aerated and they never told us when we got there. In June we should have excellent conditions.   Slow play and no one home to move things along.   No better than a public course that should charge $30\nWill never play there again
1,"This is my 2nd favorite hamburger place I have EVER eaten at!... My food is always perfect! I love the pretzel bun! I would strongly suggest trying the pretzel bun! The sweet potato tots are amazing!!! All of the staff I have meet are amazing, the owners are awesome, and the Kimmy special drink is not only refreshing but almost guilt free. I practice out of a clinic close by so I have even had lunch meetings here! I couldn't recommend Rehab Nurger more!"
1,Great beds! Good prices. Ok service .. Huh? Duh? Wha? I work at a tanning salon and last year at band camp.....
1,"Stopped in for a beer and to try something new for lunch. The staff was very friendly and patient with me looking over the menu. I took the waiters advice and decided to try the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of the green chili mac. Now, I was hesitant about this chicken sandwich.... I mean, prickly pear, what does that even mean? But take it from me... it is a must try. I brought the sandwich to my mouth and instantly feel in love. It is by far the most interesting chicken sandwich I've ever had. Is one of those things I can't explain WHY, all I can do is tell you that you will love it. The beer was great. The green chili mac was interesting as well, but delicious. I have just found my new favorite lunch spot."
0,"Formerly Stars Comedy Club, Bentley's Bar & Grill is not to be confused with Bentley's on 27 in downtown Charlotte.\n\nBentley's Bar & Grill is a sports bar in downtown Belmont NC with a flair for running out of burgers or just about anything else at 9pm on Saturdays.  Yes the manager comp'ed our meal.  But our waitress was completely indifferent and service overall was terrible.  It still took half an hour to get a few beers and cokes to our table.  She refilled water once every two hours and everyone in our group was eating dinner.  \n\nBut I don't blame our waitress.  All of the problems that night were indicative of the management's inability to pay attention to the basic details of running a restaurant.  Don't make me beg for food and drink.  You're the ones that put the sign on the door that says \""Open for business\""."
0,"After getting an advert in the mail touting an extensive gluten free menu, I was pretty pumped to try this place out the next time I got a craving for pizza (which is never!). I called the location that has the GF menu and was told that they don't deliver to my area and that i'd have to call the North Side location. I'm not driving anywhere when I want pizza (it's a lazy night in/delivery kind of thing for me), so no gluten free for me. Sorry, stomach. \nBoth locations I called had terrible phone service. I was given a turnaround time of an hour, and much to my surprise, it arrived after 30 minutes. I ended up pretty dissatisfied though. \nI ordered a buffalo wing pizza which tasted like greasy bread. They just threw slices of breaded chicken on top and a few sprinkles of buffalo sauce under the cheese. They also failed to include the ranch dressing(s!) that the pizza was supposed to come with. Getting a whiff of ranch dressing was what made me crave pizza in the first place, ha. I ordered spicy citrus wings as well and they just tasted like... kind of spicy fried food. I'm bummed that the one time a year I eat pizza was such a letdown. I had high hopes for you Mandy's!"
1,"Can I say enough good things about Bouchon?  The answer is no.\n\nI LOVE Bouchon.  I've been here for both brunch and dinner and given the financial means, I'll continue to go back.\n\nBrunch was absolutely delightful.  I love the natural sunlight that bathes the restaurant and view looking out towards the Venezia pools.  They have really good coffee, which is a staple in a brunch place.  We ordered beignets with nutella and homemade blackberry jam.  I ordered the Gravlax, a fresh and light DIY plate.  While you can get this dish at a lot of other brunch places, it was really refreshing and I wanted something light since I didn't want to hate my life after a heavy brunch.  \nSide note: I would highly recommend NOT ordering drinks for brunch.  My mimosa was $12.50, average, and in retrospect not really worth it.  Stick with the food people.\nSide side note: I couldn't find the infamous chicken & waffles on the menu. Unless I'm blind, it may be a special.  Next time, I'll definitely ask.\n\nMy dinner experience was a few months back with a group of 8.  Our server, bless his heart I can't remember his name, was outstanding and exceptionally professional, helpful, and informative.  He was the epitome of what service in a restaurant owned by a James Beard award winning chef should be.  The foie gras special was possibly the best I've ever had and still makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I had the poulet roti.  My chicken was juicy, moist, flavorful, and just wonderfully delicious.\n\nGo to Bouchon.  Go for brunch.  Go for date night.  Go for a business dinner.  Go alone.  Just go."
0,"Awful customer service. Arrived at 4:00 pm (check in 3:00) and room was not ready. Came back at 5:00 and room still not ready. There was a 10 minute wait for each desk trip. Was given another room which had dirty dishware outside that stayed until the next day. Bags of laundry were also in the hallway for several hours. \n\nFirst night I used the bathtub and it took forever to drain and the faucet dripped all night. I put a towel in to muffle the sound. Next night I used the shower and the faucet handle fell off!  Told the desk at checkout and she said \""thank you.\""  Really? I don't think she even apologized. \n\nChecked with the hotel desk checkout morning for the airport shuttle time. 12:00 she said. Perfect. Come down to get the shuttle but it left at 11:00. To get to the airport I now have to pay almost $60 before tip as the next shuttle leaves at 1:00. \n\nFor $100+ a night, your money is better spent at Caesars or the Venetian where the hotel and service are impeccable."
1,"Great news: we found out that the \""cheese price increase\"" from a few months ago seems to have been a real thing. They've remedied this and the pizza is back to $5 again. \n\nAn update since last time: the cinnamon sticks are really good. Surprisingly good. And the staff are friendly and generous with handing out a second tub of frosting. \n\nWe've never had a bad experience here, and have had several great experiences with the co-owner. \n\nThanks, guys!"
