0,I am standing in front of the store. Doors are locked. No one here or answering phone. Posted YELP hours say they were suppose to be open over an hour ago. Drove all the way from Henderson with my friends to buy gis? Etc. very frustrating. Won't be back and will spread the word to our dojo communities.
1,"I absolutely love this place! I first stared there almost a year ago after purchasing a three month groupon. I was hesitant to become a member because it seemed like a big commitment, but with Yogini's affordable monthly rates I couldn't pass up the opportunity. The space is clean and comfortable and the teachers are SO nice and friendly. The classes are good workout but can also be more relaxing, depending on how hard you want to push yourself. I recommend this place for everyone!"
0,"Im writing this review as I am walking out of this POOR service restaurant. I got seated at 4:35pm and there was about 6 waiters working, and waited for at least 10 minutes for service. We were ignored during that time, then decided to walk out of the restaurant. Neither of the waiters had asked what we wanted to drink nor if we were ready to order. We then went to Goldilocks where we got great service from time we got seated."
1,"We decided to stop in during a recent trip to Vegas after seeing the dinner in the show Hungry Investors. I must admit, the food was amazing and just as the show highlighted the service was slow. This lil dinner could easily be 5 stars if they had better service. I had the prime Benedict and the wide had the traditional, both were absolutely amazing. Even with the chaotic service I still have to admit this was a great stop."
0,"I FLAT REFUSE TO STEP FOOT IN WinCo Foods for as long as I am residing in Las Vegas. I went in today and trouble began from the second I pulled into the lot. The parking spaces on the North side had broken glass all over the place and with traffic behind me I had to drive through it. Not cool. Then after getting a space I can't even get to the door because the hordes of people are gawking at a Henderson PD Parking Enforcement officer who was circling like a vulture waiting to write tickets. Once inside I had a foot run over by a shopping cart and in the bulk foods section I had 2 different people ram me in the derriere with a cart in under 90 seconds. Hello? I'm 6'4 and wearing a red shirt. It's not like they couldn't see me! I know I'm not a small guy. But I'm trying to lose weight so having a steel shopping cart attached to my rear is not going to help me any. \n\nSo after extracting myself from the shopping carts of mayhem I head over to the deli counter. I ask them a simple question about the source of their meats and I get the classic I don't have a clue shrug. Ugh! After fighting the madhouse to get through the rest of the store for what I need I finally get up to the front to check out. I have 16 items...I thought it was 15, my bad. Self check out is for 15 items..it's posted on the overhead sign. I get in line and next thing I know I have some woman counting my items and saying I have 1 too many. Fine, I take an item out of the cart and set it to the side and she's like sorry, you have to go to another line. I tell her I now have 15 items, she's like you need to go to another line. At that point I'm at thermonuclear launch mode (this is ultra rare for me) and I'm like this is ridiculous. I raise my voice and tell her and a lot of others in earshot: Let me tell you how I'm going to save at WinCo...I'm leaving, and I WON'T BE BACK! On my way out the door a couple that saw what happened said good for me, that I did the right thing. Not that I needed the validation but still...enough is enough. \n\nMaybe when someone carves a replica of the Taj Mahal in ice in Hell, Michigan will I ever step foot in that store again. 1 star, and a bump to the EEK! I THINK NOT / Worst of Las Vegas list and an email to WinCo Corporate is my response. \n\nFor the sake of readability I've left out even more bad things that happened on this trip...don't even get me started on the bakery! Ugh!"
1,"This is my favorite chicken strip place!! OMG I LOVE IT HERE!! I wish they had one in los angeles, so sad. But yeah everything here is BOMB!!! From their tasty toast to their sweet tea, OMG MADE TO PERFECTION. Can't leave out the chicken strip.. ooo la la.. i loveeeeeee it.. I think I want to move to vegas just for this restaurant. lol.. but yeah their sweet tea is better than mcdonalds. wayyy better. it has the right sweetness, delisssssssshh!! omg i just love it. LOVEEE YOUUU CANES!!"
1,So prefer this over the super center on decatur. Ready to navigate and well laid out.
0,The good was decent but the staff didn't seem very friendly here. They really like to nickel and dime you here for everything it seems like. It was clean at least. They don't really offer anything that would make me want to come back. Go down the street a block to Los Taquitos instead.
0,"The food was reasonably good but not good enough to prompt us to return. This restaurant's location make it a tourist eatery; we felt rushed through our meal. We ordered guac and chips and drinks to start, 5 mins later ordered dinner. The drinks & guac/chips (which were good) arrive 15 mins after we placed the order & our dinner (which was fair) arrived 2 mins after that. There was barely room on the table for the food, but what was more disappointing is we sensed the restaurant/server was more interested in quick table turnovers. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert, but just brought out the bill. There are plenty of other Mex-themed restaurants in this city; the food here is not that special. This is not the place to chill and chat."
0,Extremely unprofessional owner and staff. They kept taking money from my credit card until my balance became negative. staff needs more training as some of them are rude. I liked the view of my room but everything was ruined by the brunch and the credit card
0,A lot of cash for not a lot of food.  The food tasted ok but I paid $28 bucks for a ribeye that was as thin as a burger at a fast food joint.  The have way to many items on the menu and the waiter couldnt answer simple questions about any of the items from out party of 6.
1,"After three unsuccessful attempts, I finally made it to La Bocca, and fourth time's a charm! The food was perfectly executed, the service on point and the ambiance relaxing and casual on a weekday afternoon.\n\nThe order:\n\nFlight of three ice creams (sorbet - strawberry, lemon, basil, Maya Farm Mint with Chocolate Chips, Salted Caramel with Toasted Almonds) $5\n\nBruschetta planks: pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper\nMozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic\n\nMargarita pizza\n\nWarm queen creek olives and artisan toast\n\nMediterranean plate: basil hummus, babaganoush with warm feta, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast and house made flat bread\n\nA 5-star experience all the way."
0,"The search for decent Chinese food in the valley continues, as Jong Wah won't be our go-to place.\n\nWe started with the Popo Platter. Though we were one of just three tables there on a Saturday night around 7:30, it took nearly 30 minutes for our platter to come out. It was plated beautifully. Unfortunately, the fried shrimp had an odd texture I had to pass on, and the crab ragoon and ribs were barely lukewarm. The highlight was the egg rolls. These were clearly made in-house because the insides were crunchy. As in, not previously frozen and then defrosted mushiness. They were very good.\n\nWe ordered Kung Pao chicken and a beef and brocolli dish, plus house fried rice. The two dishes were well spiced. Often spicy dishes are just ungodly spicy where you can't taste anything else, but these actually had some flavor. It's just too bad the quality of beef was so poor you wouldn't want to eat it by itself.\n\nThe house fried rice was outstanding, with huge shrimp. We'd highly recommend the rice and eggrolls.\n\nWe also had a coupon, and our bill, with one soda, was $40. Ouch. We couldn't make heads or tails of our itemized, handwritten bill.\n\nThey do have an outdoor patio."
1,"it was nice that we were in the  heart of downtown. the nice thing the tour buses pick up right there. the front desk staff was knowledgeable and help setup my tours.\nthe room was big and clean. the room had 42 \"" tv . the hotel has parking under garage. but it does cost."
1,"Whenever I'm sick, I get the preserved pork and egg congee (porridge) to-go with a side of extra Chinese donut to dip in.  I haven't tried anything else, but that congee always hits the spot."
0,I agree with the last review. This place is hilarious. It is probably the largest joke casino on the strip just waitint to get torn down and replaced with something trendy. Its in a holding pattern of sorts.
1,This place has some good food and is a nice place to hang with friends after a good workout. I usually get a burger here and they come out pretty good. They have a bunch of beers on tap and the interior of the place is set up nicely. Live music some nights and a game room with darts and pool tables as well. The patio outside is great if you're a smoker (not me though). Prices are average to higher but at least it's going towards a real restaurant and not a chain.
1,"Unpretentious, well done french food on the las vegas strip.  They offer very approachable classic french dishes, as well as the usual burgers and fries for non foodie types.  Expect nothing fancy; menu is also a bit limited.  Food is great tho, and atmosphere is comfortable with great outside dining (right across from the amazing bellagio fountain!).  Also, reasonable prices for vegas!"
0,"If I could select a minus star rating, I would. I've been on hold trying to track a package for over 20 minutes (this time), this is my 3rd attempt THIS MORNING. I am a daily pick up customer and I've never had so many issues with them. Just two weeks ago they delivered packages that were intended for Northern California, instead they shipped them to Phoenix, AZ. Their customer service is HORRIBLE, no follow up calls and they were finally delivered 3 days later!!! They apologize profusely but nothing ever gets resolved. If I NEVER had to ship with them again I would be happy, but several of my customers use them as their carrier. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
0,"Our server was awesome but the food was horrible, and what I mean by that is it wasn't very sanitary. I ordered a baked potato and when I was spreading my butter I noticed something hard and black in it. My husband took it out and cracked it open and it seemed to be a hard piece of mold. Management insisted that it was a burnt piece of steak and it obviously wasn't, i'm not too sure how a burnt piece of steak would end up in a container of butter, and besides, why would they allow anything to do with meat around dairy products during preparation, wouldn't that be a type of cross-contamination?? Never will I eat at this restaurant again, and I feel maybe they should be visited by a health inspector."
0,"Wish I could give negative stars.\n\nCalled ahead to verify they were open for business, was told that \""everything was warming up\"", but yes, they were open.\n\nArrived at 9:36, left at 10:01.\n\nMy g/f waited at least five minutes to be seated, while I went to use the restroom.\n\nAlso, your waitress took my g/f's order and brought drinks, but never came back to the table after I came out of the restroom. And my g/f said the waitress wasn't even in her uniform yet, and changed after she took the order.\n\nNever received the appetizer, never had my order taken.\n\nSeriously, get some softer fucking toilet paper and paper towels. That's a really chickenshit way to make more profit."
0,"Yelp, you led me astray. I believed the four and five star reviews. I believed in you all. \n\nInstead, I was led to a land of hockey puck pancakes, and bacon bits scattered only in the center of those hockey puck bacon pancakes. Literally... bacon bits. In the pancakes. The bacon pancakes. I ordered bacon pancakes, not bacon bit pancakes. Guys. It was half assed and terrible. Who, after naming their cafe AFTER THEIR PANCAKES, has the gall to screw up those pancakes? That's awfully brave and jerky of you, BabyStacks. I'm kind of peeved about the whole thing.\n\nMy boyfriend's omelet was sad. It looked like a pancake with dried cheese on top. 10.00 for that? I mourned.\n\nHazelnut pancakes were dry but the whipped cream wasn't bad. \n\nDidn't catch my server's name. Didn't catch much of him actually.\n\nThe hostess asked how everything was. I said \""Eh. Barely okay.\"" She cheerily continued ringing me up and said, \""great!\""\n\nThat's about it."
1,"New Zealand lamb and the salted caramel bread pudding. \n\nI was left grunting with happiness. \n\nTwice. \n\nNothing more to say, except come here. \n\nMore than once. \n\nLife becomes that much better when you do."
0,Overpriced. Tiny dishes.. Food was cold. Avoid at all costs.
0,"Nancy... I concur! \n\nStatefarm Insurance recommended this shop and i took it there because they said the service was timely and professional. Well they have had my Porsche Cayene for a month and it always a reason why it isn't completed. In addition, they have it set up so you get updated online and can view the status of the vehicle. The key is they have to actually update it and only happens when you make a request because several weeks pass and you hear nothing. Now, most people know insurance only covers rentals for 30 days. Well my 30 days is up today. \nJeff, my rep was to call me back on Friday past for an update and now its Tuesday with no word. \n\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND!!!! I just pray the vehicle looks good!!!\n\nI will have to call Statefarm and let them know how much of a joke this company is!"
1,"Fun, sexy, and acrobatic.  This best describes Zumanity, the sensual and sexual side of Cirque Du Soleil.  \nI never want to give away what the show entails, so if you are looking for that, you might want to read on.  However, I will advise to come here with your significant other.  Zumanity celebrates different types of relationships and sensuality.  Audience participation is not required but they will encourage you to participate if you are selected.  Even the people in the very back weren't safe from being asked to participate during our show.  \nOverall:  If you are sensitive to anything sexual, sexual jokes, play, comments or crude jokes in general I will let you know now this show is not for you.  But if you are open minded and don't mind such humor, then you will enjoy this show."
0,Kept hearing about the $7.77 special that isn't advertised.  Tried it and was disappointed.  Maybe if the steak was more than a flank steak or more than 3 bites it would have been worth it.
0,"In 15 years of going to Las Vegas, this is about the worst meal I've ever had.\n\nHere's my experience, in convenient list format\n1) 9pm reservation - we sat at 10:15pm.  Seriously.  They blamed OpenTable, whatever.  At the end of the day, if they knew there were problems, how come nobody contacted us? RIDICULOUS.\n\n2) Prices - $44 for a piece of fish or chicken? Really? I've been to top restaurants in LV, NYC, SF, etc, and while I've seen expensive food, it comes along with... amazing service, uber-fresh ingredients, creative menus, etc.  This was just ripoff central.\n\n3) Food quality - my seabass was bland, as in had less flavor than microwaveable fish sticks.  One person in our party sent their food back!  Chicken was dried out, sides were meh.  The \""bright spot\"" was the appetizers, which I cannot recall even a few days later, so probably not too bright.\n\n4) Ambiance - eh, it was \""fine\"".  Nothing special, no great decor, nothing revolutionary.  \n\n5) Service was decent, they kept glasses full, etc.  Again, not amazing (no synchronized food delivery for example), just average.  Nothing to justify the cost of the meal.\n\nThe entire group walked out very disappointed.  Wouldn't go back, wouldn't recommend, wouldn't do anything ever again.  Maybe they call it Fix because it still needs to be fixed?"
1,"My new favorite sandwich shop - I squeezed in without to long of a wait.  I had a few questions and they politely directed me in the right direction regarding my preferred taste or palette. Hands down the winner ..... Reuben-ish.  This sandwich had everything you would want in / from a Reuben.  Juicy Tender, not over brined  Flavorful corned beef, and the perfect ration of cheese, kraut, and dressing.\n\nGood Job Wich - I will be back !"
1,Great coffee and very friendly staff!
0,Decided to write this review while waiting for my carry-out that is 25+ minutes overdo. This is the third straight time I've had this same exact experience at the same location. Will definitely drive the extra miles to find a more professional pizza hut. Signing off.
0,"Same thing as Dennys at almost twice the price. Marginally decent food and service.  It was clean and food was pretty quick, even with a nearly full restaurant. Parking is horrendous when all the places there are busy."
1,"Un tr\u00e8s bon endroit pour y prendre un verre dans le quartier. Il manque de places assises \u00e0 l'occasion, n'arrivez pas trop tard... surtout si vous \u00eates un groupe. Bonne s\u00e9lection de bi\u00e8res, les prix sont corrects aussi. Les drinks et les scotchs sont plus dispendieux. Le staff conna\u00eet bien ses produits. \u00c7a fait du bien d'avoir une bonne microbrasserie dans ce coin!"
0,"We've given this establishment our dollars on many occasions since this location has been opened.  The visit on Sunday (9/21)  will probably be our last. We were looking forward to watching football in a fun, group setting.... eating some awesome fall off the bone ribs and having a couple of beers.  A portion of the bad experience can be faulted towards other customers - screaming (like bloody murder) kids, parents who ignored them and a much older guy who kept staring and inching his chair closer to our table.  Eww.   But I digress.  I'm here to talk about the food and service.  After finally being seated (because of the football crowd), we waited for 10 minutes at our table before anyone even acknowledged we were there.  Then we ordered our food... which we waited... and waited for.  When it finally came, the ribs were fatty and barely warm. The fries were cold but the ranch dressing was good.  The garlic bread could have been used to replace a roof tile. To round it out, the zucchini was fair to middlin.  The beers were not that cold... so that couldn't even save the day.  We left before halftime - and to you other sports fans out there - you know it had to be bad!  While the restaurant cannot control who walks in their doors, they can provide good food and proper service.  Bad on them....  disappointing."
0,"I used to go the this restaurant, when it was a Moe's.  Moe's went out of business, and Filiberto's does what Filiberto's does.   It took over a defunct restaurant, and started selling cheap Mexican food there.  I had never eaten at a Filiberto's, or any other 'berto's in the Valley, so I begged my lunch group to go there.  Entering the restaurant, it had a rotting seafood smell.  I don't know what it was from, but it detrimental to the experience.  I ordered the red chili burro, it is my benchmark food for Mexican restaurants.  The red chili was chewy, under cooked, and lacking in flavor.  My other lunch mates did not have any better experience than I did.  This place is a definite \""NO !!!\"" in my book, and in the minds of the other members of my lunch group.  \n\nThere are other restaurants at that strip mall.  If you find yourself there, do yourself a favor, go to Pizza Roma, or Haiku Grill, or Sami's Gyros, or Port of Subs.  They are all superior to really bad Mexican at Filiberto's."
0,Sniff!  Cigarette smoke!\nThrill!  Gasp!  Electric fire!\nNouvel?  No!  Old-vel!
1,"i love this place.\ni love everything about it! the food, the staff, the drinks, the decor. it is all quite lovely!\n\nFood:\ncharred octopus- i usually hate octopus because its chewy and not pleasant to eat. but this appetizer was so good. the octopus was soft and tender and the charred parts gave it this wonderful flavor of goodness. perfect balance\n\nscallop ceviche- came in this cool little carrier almost like a wooden toolbox or something to fit in with the rustic theme of the restaurant. fresh no sand or \""sea\"" smell just GOODNESS\n\ncaramelized sea scallops- super delish. I've been on a scallop kick and these are so GOOD! just perfectly cooked on each side to brown it. YUMMMMMMMM\n\nprime rib special- they had a special the night i went for prime rib. it came out grilled which is not what I'm use to but i think i liked it even more grilled than the usual. need some sort of sauce or horseradish or something to accompany and it would have been perfect.\n\nbackyard favorite burger- gotta add the egg. came with a little tin can of french fries that weren't anything special. but the burger was quite good and would def recommend for burger lovers\n\nside of asparagus- nothing special. its asparagus!\n\nDRINKS: they have a good drink selection of cocktail and twist on classics. there is a drink that comes with an ice ball that is very similar to an old fashion but EVEN BETTER!! i might of had to0 many of them.  :) I might have to return just to drink these ice ball old fashion type drinks. think its called midnight rambler? \n\n\nwould highly recommend making reservations as this place gets busy!"
0,"Fun, but for a family of 4 to go two times, it's $78, way too expensive to come back!!"
0,"We were so excited to have stumbled across a great little Mexican place in the South Hills that we dashed in with a party of 4 on a Saturday night without a second thought. Very soon after our hopes were dashed and or appetite was answered with a heaping spoon of disappointment.  \n\nINITIAL IMPRESSIONS\n\n- When our waitress came over to take our drink orders, she had no clue what variety of margaritas they offered.  She was unsure of the difference between salt and sugar.  Both she, and the bartender, needed clarification on what a \""Captain and Diet\"" was. \n\n-Margaritas were fine once the order was corrected, but the aforementioned Captain and Diet was a watery mess. Either they aren't using top shelf as advertised (and paid for) or they are watering down their liquor.  As a Pittsburgh-dwelling, borderline alcoholic the one thing I know with absolute certainty is how my rum is supposed to taste.\n\nSERVICE AND ORDERING\n\n- One line will sum this up, NICKEL AND DIME.  With your entree its not rice AND beans, rather it's \""Rice OR Beans?\"".  God forbid you want both, like at any other Mexican restaurant in the world,  Your sin is punished with a $5 up-charge.\n\n-Similarly, you are given a choice of sour cream OR guacamole with your entree.  You guessed it, $5 more.\n\n- Overall the service was a disaster. Between the waitress, owner and bartender there was a total failure to launch.  Repeated requests for extra napkins, more chips, a glass of water, or even the rest of our order were put off for an embarrassingly long time, some never answered at all.\n\nFOOD\n\n- Don't come here looking for great salsa.  Their recipe is no more than pureed tomatoes, cilantro and a dash of vinegar.  No heat and no flavor.\n\n- The food served to us was average in terms of Mexican cuisine.  Nothing mind blowing but not quite dog food either.  Think, better than Taco Bell but falling far short of Emiliano's or even Mad Mex.\n\nReally, the bottom line to this review is that this place has so-so food at an over-market price and terrifyingly subpar service.  Honestly, this was a very disappointing experience for us, as we wanted so much to love Cocina Mendoza.\n\nMaybe we can chalk this up to growing pains. I would be willing to give them a second chance in a year or so, if they make it that long."
1,The gorgonzola NY strip is amazing!!!!
0,Place is overly crowded every time I come on the weekends. People are constantly pushing and the bouncers don't seem to care. I have had my credit card stolen from the bar and my phone stolen out of my purse.
0,"I just came in for my 1:30 pm consultation on 12/8/09.  I actually arrived ten minutes early.  I walked out along with whatever thousands of dollars you would have charged me. Let me tell you why. \n\nI initially called the 800 number to set the appointment. They refused to give me any information about what they do. I asked if this is a surgery center, they refused to answer. I told them I wanted my double chin reduced or removed and \""do you do surgery?\"".  They said I would have to come in for a consultation. Then they transferred me to the local office since it was same day.  They gave me the same run-around, but I thought, maybe that's how these things work. \n\nI arrived, and they asked me to fill out 3 pages of information prior to my consultation. I said, \""first, can you tell me if this is a surgery center?\"" and they wouldn't answer. So I asked \""Is this some kind of miracle cream pitch?\"" and they finally said \""No\"", \""we do surgery\"". I said I'd rather not have to fill out all the info as I was going to go to three separate consultations before making my decision on where to have my surgery, but she insisted. Ok, but really, 3 pages of my info before even talking to me?  Ok, maybe that's how these things work.\n\nI filled it out, and while doing so, the office lady said \""Let me turn up the volume on the TV as this is the initial part of your consultation\"".  Seriously?  It's nothing but testimonials and I already got that on your website.  What a disappointment this was turning into.  \n\nThen, despite having arrived 10 minutes early, the lady tells me that since I arrived so late, my appointment wouldn't take place for at least 40 minutes (or 2:10pm).  What?!?!  Is that how you do business?  Why not just tell me your first appointment is at 2:10?   I spent an hour of my day and a gallon of my gas to try and pay you thousands of dollars for elective surgery and this is how you treat your customers?!?  \n\nSo I asked the lady if I could have my information back as I was leaving, and she said \""Well, since your hopping from doctor to doctor we should keep it\"".  What?!?!  \n\nIf I were an investor in this company, I would cringe at the money walking out the door for lack of patient customer service."
0,"UGH.  I was hyped rehab for ... ever a couple of years back.  I was all hyped to go until I got there.  Seriously, I won't even admit how much of my life I wasted waiting to get into this frat house on crack. It's a shame. Seriously.  The only reason we waited that long was because that was the whole point of the trip.\n\nAnyway by the time we did get in it was not scorching hot, everyone was hammered the pool looked green (YES! What do you think these dirtbags are actually going to get OUT of the pool to piss?!) \n\nThis is the level of NASTY that you're working with: I was wearing a white bikini top with brown trim.. by the time i got to my hotel the white of my bikini was YELLOW. And I truly doubt that it was the amount of chlorine.\n\nThis place is nasty.  The only reason people like it is because these stupid skank girls go there practically naked.  Get a job as a stripper and call it a day ho-bag.  And the tool beefcakes that go there are all the same, L-A-M-E.\n\nThe bathrooms? Nasty.\nThe drinks? One plastic water bottle thingy of margarita-type drink was $35. Yes, Thirty-effing-Five.  For one drink.\nThe cover? $50. Stupidest waste ever.\nCrowded? There were THOUSANDS of people in that pool area. gross.\nThe crowd? Cool if you are 21 of if you have the maturity of a high school kegger party crowd still.\n\nThe one crappy thing about it was that I was at the Hard Rock's pool before Rehab started for the season and it was perfect.\n\nBut Rehab? I would rather go to the Wet Republic any day."
0,"Went here for a quick business lunch last week, and unfortunately the quick part was missing and the food, when it came wasn't worth the wait. I ordered the meatloaf, which seemed popular with all the ordered I was overhearing. Came with 2 sides and a up of soup. Soup was veggie and was pretty good, but the meatloaf was not that good. Lacked flavor and the \""gravy\"" was all Ketchup...eh. The mac and cheese was average. The downer though was the service...our server just seemed off and not happy. Oh well...hope she cheered up. A one time stop for me."
1,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not related to the owner nor do I have stock in this restaurant.\n\nMy family spent 6 days in Vegas shoveling in buffet after buffet.  I was in desperate need of Korean food, and I have pretty low expectations when it comes to Vegas Korean food.  Nevertheless, I took my chances with yelp, and we stumbled across this place.  \n\nWe ordered jjambong, chicken cutlet, dolsot bibimbab, and some fish dish.  The banchans came out first, and it was very impressive.  The main dishes came out, and each dish was spot on.  I'm not going to dissect each dish, but each dish could have been it's own restaurant.\n\nIf you saw what I looked like, you would trust my food review.  \n\nThis is the first legitimate Korean restaurant we have eaten at.  This restaurant could definitely keep up with the popular restaurants in k-town.  \n\nIf you come here and complain that the service was bad or the walls didn't meet your artistic needs...come on.   Asian people aren't known for their service, so let's get over that aspect.\n\nIf you are craving something spicy and tired of the omelette and meat stations, give this place a try."
1,Absolutely delicious! Our waiter Robert was great as well. The Andy's sage fried chicken is by far the best thing on the menu; it's a big sized portion so make sure you're hungry!
1,Food is great as is the service.  The restaurant is large so there is usually no wait.  This is a great family spot.  Give it a try.
0,Ordered open face brisket sand. $13 for tough meat and the meat was difficult to identify under the gallon of super sweet barbecue sauce. My eating partners salad was pretty good though.
0,"I went back for my follow-up appointment, which didn't go quite as well as the first. One condition had mostly cleared up, but the other hadn't, so I was prescribed a new medication. Dr. Smith spent a couple minutes asking a few questions and writing on her chart, then quickly left the room before I could ask about anything else. I understand appointments were running late, but that's no reason to rush other patients. \n\nI had a bad reaction to the medication, so I called the Thomas Dermatology after-hours line. It has a recording that says an on-call physician will check the line every few hours. I left a message at about 7pm and didn't hear back until 3:30pm the next day. \n\nI canceled my follow-up. Time to find a new doctor."
0,"I really don't know what all the fuss is about.  This place seemed like a rather small buffet w/ just so-so food.\n\nMy friend's crab legs were still frozen, all the meats are rather bland or have some herb on it that shouldn't be there, the sushi is quite awful, and  their salad bar was weak.  I tried a little bit of everything and it was just not that impressive.\n\nThe highlight?  The pesto pasta w/ chicken and sundried tomatoes.  But even that didn't taste as good the 2nd time around (new batch), all my friends agreed.  \n\nThere isn't anything on the buffet that's fabulous and quite frankly, i was very disappointed.  I paid $30 for that?!"
1,"They did a good job...I tend to judge it not just by the result but by how much attention the guy is giving your car.  He worked hard, and the interior looked great.  Would definitely return"
0,"I took a pair of shoes to this place.  It was a simple repair, they just needed the straps glued back in.  I was shocked when I went in and there were display cases of watches and only old shoes in sight.  It looked like a fence for something.  I showed him my shoes and he told me the only thing he could do was staple the straps on the outside.  The shoes are Steve Madden Juke and it would have change the entire look.  He informed me that was the look now.  Um no, I'll try somewhere else and left.  I took them to another shop and the owner glued them and fixed them for me for $15.  Would never go back to this place, not even if I were shopping for a watch."
0,Stay far away from this Dr. The RUDEST office staff ever. Can't believe they think it's ok to treat seniors like this. Never ever going back. Had to give one star no other option.
1,"All in all, really wonderful food full of flavor and a lot to choose from.  They only offer dry brisket so if you are a moist brisket fan, find something else to order.  Plenty to choose from or dunk the brisket in the sauce to moisten it up."
1,"I've been to the Wahsun with my wife several times.  The food is always good and the prices are wonderful.\nBetween my wife and I, we've pretty much sampled the menu and found everything good.  I especially enjoy the barbeque duck but everything is good.\nThe owner's wife, Rose, adds with her, friendliness and personality, to the dining experience as well."
1,"Delicious!!!\n\nFirst time at TAO and it was great! It was a 20min wait w/o reservation, which wasn't that bad if you are starving. Anyway, had a drink at the bar and chilled until we were called....\n\nFor App--thai crab cakes w/ mango chili sauce--AMAZING!\nEntree--Kun Pao Chicken w/ white rice....tasty!  \n\nI really enjoyed the food and the service was great! One of the waiters stamped our hand for the LAVO niteclub...a pity we never made it there lol.\n\nNext time I'm in town, I will be stopping by...yep yep!"
0,"I lived in brown-carpeted one-bedroom. \n\nPros:\n*Not expensive.\n*Close to the freeway and bus line.\n*Maintenance guy came 1 out of 3 times the same day. 2 times my claim was forgotten for 3 days until I reminded the office.\n\nCons:\n*No washer and dryer. You have to get a laundry card to use laundry.\n*No lighting in bedroom and living room areas.\n*There is the whole ONE ceiling fan in my apartment which is located in dining area.\n*Their \""state of the art fitness center\"" is located in 201 West property, so it is a long walk. Also, you have to pay $25 for the key deposit. Gym has few machines, but lacks free weights.\n*Resident lounge, billiards room, heated spa and sand volleyball court are also located in 201 West property, not at the Mill Pointe. Also, you have to make a reservation for resident lounge to get in and it is open only at Mill Pointe operating hours.\n*Drilling A/C and water noises from neighbors. Also, you can hear how old A/C system is when you turn on yours! (Mill Pointe has been in business since 1980!)\n*Noises from outside were very loud.\n*No storage: there is only teeny walk-in closet, no storage rooms.\n*Very little kitchens: it was hard for me to accommodate all my kitchen gadgets and dishware; some had to live their lives in the boxes.\n*Tiny refrigerator: since I cook, my food wouldn't fit in this smaller than regular refrigerator.  \n*Police cars are very frequent at the apartment complex which tells about the safety in the area.\n\nI wouldn't recommend living here."
1,"Awesome beer selection and great burgers.  World famous?!?  Well, that's a bit of a stretch.  I think there are other burgers here in Phoenix that are just as good.  I'm not saying I've come across one that's much better, but definitely on the same level as this.  That being said, if you're looking for an amazing burger joint, this is one of them.  Pair it up with the awesome beer selection and that's what makes this place a cut above the rest.  It's a great location in a great neighborhood.  Prices are fairly reasonable but anytime you go above the $10 mark for a burger, it's a problem."
1,Where a man can be a man and eat like a dang Viking.  Slabs of meat come at you in waves.  So many types of meats in so many cuts.  A man is in heaven.  It's costly but Damn worth it.  You pay for what you get and then some.  I've been here several times and never ever been disappointed. Lunch is cheaper with almost the same amount of meat cuts.....oops.  this was for Texas Dr Brazil
1,"I ordered the pork bbq sandwich and if was really good. The sauce was tangy southern style vinegar based sauce that came on the side which was nice because the bun didn't get soggy.  The hush puppies were homemade and tasted great.  But the real star of the menu was the bbq chicken; it was totally off the hook.  Deep fried and then dunked in their signature sauce, it was a AMAZING.  I don't typically like chicken on the bone or dark meat but I dove right in and I am glad I did, this place is the real deal.  The only thing I didn't like was the coleslaw; it wasn't very good but the bread they served on the side was really good.  This is a true old school drive inn and you eat in your car, which was a negative for me.  It was tough to eat this amazing bbq in our car.  It is nostalgic to eat at a drive inn but not practical when grubbing on bbq.\n\nService was friendly and it was an all around great experience.  They don't take credit cards but they so have an atm on site (that charges you $2 transaction fee).  Not too far off Interstate 77 so if you are driving through Charlotte take exit 9C and stop on in for a real BBQ treat."
0,"This is NOT the place to buy any GPS or GPS accessories. \n\nMy GPS mount got trashed by Delta, so I went here to pick up a replacement (near the airport, 10 min drive)\n\nUnfortunately, they have the worst selection of GPS accessories, and I did buy something but does not really work, so I have to return them now. \n\nService was...okay, I didn't see a soul that was working in that area until I reached the casher. Casher was very nice gal though, so for her I'm giving 2 stars. Store gets minus 5 stars."
0,"My rating is totally based on the service and not the food. Food is fine here but I had  terrible overall experience which ruined the good part too. They made me wait for over 40 minutes (after saying that waiting time is only 10 minutes). Besides, they seated other people who came after me. After I got seated, they took another 10 minutes to take the order. I know this is a very popular place, there is a lot of waiting usually. But they need to make sure that they are attending customers in order and with priority. I went with high expectation but came out with this review."
1,"One of my favorite places to eat a meal, or enjoy happy hour.  Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food.  I love pretty much everything on the menu; my favorites are the big wave and fries, the veggie tacos, and chips and salsa at happy hour.  The beers are ice cold here."
0,"Ordered a white pizza which was flavorless.just bread topped with cheese.it does not take much to add a little flavor punch to a pizza..not to mention the burnt crust which took away the lil taste there was.\nAlso ordered a bleu cheese apple walnut salad-for $9 its such a fraud..literally 20 spinach leaves topped with chewy gummy mozzarella...spinach leaves were not fresh,clearly rotting at the edges.\nOur silverware had old old rock hard cheese sticking on them..yuck!!\nHave to say our server was noce though.\nNot coming back!"
0,"I'm just going to start out by saying i have been here probably about 15 times since they opened, that being said I'm still pretty dissapointed. I continue to try this place because it is right around the corner from my house. I feel a struggle to get any attention from the bartenders whenever I am there. They just give soooo much attention to the staff sitting at the bar that I feel I have to fight for my attention. There are two bartenders that I am satisfied with, one being a gentleman i call \""light socket Larry\"" (spiked hair) and an African American lady that I have only seen twice. They give full attention to the whole bar (my reasoning for 2 stars) but the other 3 ladys that work back there are far from even sub par. The food never really makes me happy. The native on bell around 67th ave and the one by the stadium are great! What's going on here? I seriously want to find a new place to go but there is nothing by my house. PLEASE FIX THIS PLACE! YOU HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR MONTHS NOW! WHY IS IT STILL LIKE THIS!"
0,"Overall Fuel Pizza is a good franchise, but this location is terrible.  I will never go back. I have had too many terrible experiences.  The employees are outright rude. I cant believe this place stays in business.  The pizza is subpar as well. If you want fuel pizza go to one of their other locations.  Plaza Midwood is solid."
0,"this place is not as great as you would think.  it's more like a novelty shop than a supply surplus store, which is probably the whole point.\n\nweaponry is mostly limited only to the same type of fancy cutlery you can get at the swap meet, self-defense products like mace and stun guns (which you can get anywhere else for much less), and \""specialty\"" ammunition - whatever that is.\n\nas for survival gear:  you can find a vastly more competent and higher-quality selection at Bass Pro Shop or Mad Man Army Supply (Sahara / Jones)...and probably for much cheaper too.\n\nfunny enough, they also try and peddle unofficial products like posters and photos from movies like \""Zombieland\"" and \""Night of the Living Dead\"" that are WAAAYYY overpriced for obviously being printed from an inkjet printer like the kind you have at home.\n\nbeware, anybody who says this place is \""great\"" or gives it a high rating obviously has no real idea what to look for when it comes to actual survival gear of any kind.  definitely not recommended."
1,Love this place - I have been stopping by since it opened in the far NE Valley years ago. GREAT selection of wine and their fruit and cheese plate is awesome. Sitting out on the patios when the weather is nice is the best.
1,If you are looking for me on a weekend and can't find me....I am HERE!!\nI will tell you that Home Depot has educated me on so many 'home' projects - there is such a wealth of service staff there that always ask you if ' you need any help' and its probably because I look LOST.\nI have spent a lot of time in the paint dept - ask for DAVID - and tell him 'the ASIAN woman - Jeanie' referred you!!\n(he looks like Ben Stiller!!! you will know when you see him behind the counter!!) He has helped me custom blend many mixes to get the right color. Bless him!!\nI like it better than Lowe's - I could never find anything in there - from the way things are organized. And it seems they are always short-staffed.\n...if Home Depot only sold groceries....that would be glorious =0)
0,"I've gone to this theater a few times, and never had any bad experiences until yesterday. Went to see Anchorman 2, and upon walking into the theater, there was trash EVERYWHERE. They didn't even bother to try to clean up after the last movie. Not just trash in the cup holders, but on the floor as well. It was disgusting. Never have I seen that at a theater before. I was shocked. Needless to say, I won't be back again. I have a photo of how the theater looked, but it's not letting me upload it for this review."
0,"No!!  Don't do it!  \n\nThis is my second review on this particular merchant.  They were previously located at 1455 W. Chandler Blvd Ste B-11 inside of the Bellagio Clinic.  They promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service.  Not at all...\n\nApparently, if you are a male and have an accent, certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service, let alone treatment.  Let's just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place.  To the point of being prejudicial, but that is his story to tell...\n\nI've really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience I had.  They swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move (another 10 miles out of my way, now totally 20 from my home) would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician's office.\n\nHere is what I know:\n\nIt's impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.  They are either under staffed, overbooked or both.\n\nIt's impossible to speak to someone who is not a child.  Seriously, they all are just out of high school.  They can't answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at Facebook on their cell phones.\n\nThere is never any management on site.  How is this even permitted by their corporate office?\n\nThe website says \""Our staff includes a certified esthetician, a registered nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a full time board certified medical doctor\"".  Not true.  No one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised Laser Technicians.  \n\nYou cannot call them directly.  You must call the 800 number to ask questions about anything.  Even to ask driving directions when you cannot locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place.  \n\nThey have tip jars in the rooms.  Really?! Tip jars??!  Is this Starbucks?  This to me is completely tacky.  I have been in the service/hospitably/spa industry for over ten years and I have NEVER seen nor would even ever ALLOW a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a HUGE sign stating that tips are appreciated!  Of course they are - but don't make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one - especially when the service is so very poor.\n\nTo submit a complaint, you must fill out a form online and wait for a call.  I did just that and received a call the next day from what I assume to be the location manager.  She left a voice mail.  I've been trying to call her back for three days.  It goes straight to voice mail.  I've left a voice mail but still no return call.\n\nOver it and getting all of my money back from Groupon..."
1,"I LOVE this place!  Their prices have risen a bit to $2.25 but that is for ANY type of garment.  Other places charge your $15-20 to dry clean a dress but this place is $2.25 straight across the board.  They offer same day service too for the unbelievable price of $2.25!!!  I was so surprised when I asked for same day service that they didn't jack up the price but when they say they have a fixed price list, they mean it!!\n\nThe only (minor) negative is that you have to pay when you drop off the items so if you have 30 items to be cleaned, make sure you have the $$ before you head in there."
1,Went to this shop today 10/17. It was closed. Now they have a Modern Sushi open in the old spot. Just for the benefit of other patrons looking for it -- its now CLOSED.
0,"Just another Mimi's. It is a chain. The attempt to set themselves off with opening doors and greeting people is a bit saccharin it execution, although it is a good idea. The appetizers and salad were corporate creations with little panache.  The service was between slow and moderate, on what appeared to be a small crowd. I will be moving on. Goodyear / Phoenix is such a large area and there are so many choices. Sorry Mimi's"
0,"We drove all the way from the strip to try the bun hue and ginger ice tea. The bun bo hue had no hint of spice, huyet, or pig's feet. I had Pho that was more spicier than this. Big disappointment however the ginger ice tea was good. \n\nFood is 3 stars but will subtract one star for the high prices. I can get the same quality of food in Chinatown."
1,"The atmosphere is great! We had great wine and awesome food! My girlfriend and I went on a Saturday night and enjoyed the live music... Two guys playing guitar - classic all American rock n roll! It wasn't too loud. We sat right next to them and could still hear our conversation.\nThe food: we had crocodile pot-stickers, jalape\u00f1o rabbit and prime rib paninni. \nI'd pass on the pot-stickers next time as they were fried (I prefer steamed) but my girlfriend loved them. \nThe jalape\u00f1o rabbit is a must have! It is not spicy at all. Tastes like chicken! The Jasmine rice it was served with was also great.\nThe prime rib paninni was my personal favorite! The bread was toasted just right and the prime rib reminded me of a French dip sandwich. It had delicious red peppers on it and was very tasty!\nWe'll be back again and are really happy it's in the neighborhood."
1,"For all those griping about the tax subsidies for the light rail, Phoenix needed a light rail system, just like it needed I-10, 202, 51, and 101, and a big airport too; pretty much all paid for with our tax dollars. You paid for those extra lanes of congestion even if you never drive one of those roads. We all did. \n\nAre they all perfect and to everyones liking? Of course not. We're either a growing city or a dying one, so keep on expanding the system I say. \n\nI've enjoyed riding it when I can i think it's a source of pride for our city.  I give it four stars for the cool factor, of finally having a public transportation system that I would actually use. [Train vs. bus] I only hope the system will connect more shopping hubs, schools and the sports arenas in Glendale one day."
0,Horrible. Got food poisoning from this place. Way too cheap. Would rather spend $20 on good sushi than $3 on something that looks like it has been on the conveyor belt for 1 or more hours.
1,"I was hesitant to book my cab with them after reading some of these reviews, but I needed to book a cab with a company I knew takes credit cards so I could catch an early morning flight for work. I called a couple of days ago and the dispatcher booked my cab and said another dispatcher would call 30 minutes before my reserved time to confirm I still needed the cab. As promised, the dispatcher called 30 minutes before and said she'd send the driver out. He arrived 10 minutes EARLY and was nice enough to wait without his ticker on as I quickly grabbed the last of my bags. I unfortunately didn't catch his name but he was very nice, drove safely and loaded and unloaded my bags from his trunk. All in all, a pleasant experience. Being a local, I don't use cabs often but the next time I do need one, I'll be calling Desert Cab again."
0,"I found a disgusting piece of hair in my breakfast sandwich (which btw is really not that good. They use kraft singles for the cheese!!!). Anyway, I told an employee about the hair; she insisted that there is no way and that I should \""prove it to her.\""  And then I told the manager...who also asked me to find the hair...and after trying to look for it for a minute (while people just stared), she asked me to sit down and find the hair. WHAT THE HECK????\n\nFinally my husband spoke to her and complained and she finally said she would replace it (with a lot of attitude). And even then , she never gave us an actual sandwich, even after waiting 20 minutes. Another employee gave us one and said to enjoy. \n\nThis manager needs to be fired. Her name is Anna Karinana (sp?)."
1,"This was so fun.  Very un-Vegas. The building is older, no glitz or glam. It was hot in there too. Maybe shouldn't have gone in the heat of the day.  I'm still saying 5 stars!  My husband and I had so much fun playing some of our favorite old games. We learned about really old pinball games.  Hardly spent any money.  Not an arcade, more like a museum where you get to touch everything. Really nothing compares. Free to get in. Some of the machines already had credits on them like an employee was feeding them or something. It was awesome!!"
0,"Brought friends to enjoy a nice Friday night dinner. I was recommended to this place and went there last night. Food was alright but we were laughing and having a good time when they asked our party to keep quiet. We found out the lady who complained left before the bartender told us but still insisted we tone down our \""good\"" time. We spent $140 in meals and drinks so we got up , paid our bill and we will never go to this place ever."
1,"Heather R. and I had the absolute pleasure of happy houring at Twisted Rose yesterday evening! The cuisine, service, wine, prices & quality were superb.  Both the partner & the executive chef stopped by to chat for quite a while, they were quite delightful! I can't stop raving about the bread pudding, it was distinctively summery due to the raspberry addition.  I adore that the chef uses their wines creatively in the menu, the addition adds another level of flavor.  Sidenote: the powder rooms are adorable and spotless! I'll be back with a crowd very soon."
1,"My family has been coming to Penn Mac for as long as I can remember. My parents make monthly trips to stock up on their very large array of cheeses. The prices are fantastic. For example, parmigiano reggiano at Whole Foods is 19.99 per lb; at Penn Mac it is 14.99 per lb. The service is great, the array of products are huge, and as stated before, the prices are great. \n\nMy favorite products to purchase are:\n\nAll cheeses\nDeli meats\nCanned tomatoes\nPasta\n\""00\"" flour\nCashews\nOlive oil"
0,"Guys there's nothing to see or do here in the winter right now, heads up. It's just some wooden rocking chairs and a wooden carousel mouldering under the snow near the market. Looking forward to seeing what they do with this space come spring 2015!"
0,No coffee maker...no room service! Ridiculous!!   They were really ill-prepared for the charllotte marthon and serving hundreds of runners. No complementary water or fruit in the lobby. Ran out of coffee and checkout for runners was noon.
1,"This is my favorite place to eat while shopping at the Fashion Show Mall. They have a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches that are the perfect fare for a day of shopping, along with full size entrees if you're looking for something more substantial. I am hard pressed to come here and not order the tomato basil soup. It is served with fresh basil and a Parmesan crustini. It is rich and tomatoey with a hint of creaminess. I also consistently order the blue cheese and pear salad. The salad has fresh field greens with delicious chunks of pear, generous crumbles of blue cheese, and candied pecans. I have also had a pasta with shrimp that was delicious and the roast beef and horseradish panini, both of which I believe were specials. I highly recommend this hidden gem if you're in the area."
1,"Went here tonight on a date with my BF.  I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, service, and food.  All the ingredients were fresh and yummy. The Chow Mein was the best I have had in years.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. \n\nI would give the one sushi roll, Golden Cali Roll, we got a 3.. it was just ok. The BF liked it more than me."
1,"Visited this place the last time in Vegas.  I have to say I'd recommend it. It's in a little strip mall way off the strip, but worth the drive. Everything tasted great and the service was really good."
1,"Good sushi, good deal on the all you can eat. The service was a little slow but I'd go back again."
0,"Ew.\n\nThats a compliment, too.\n\nI don't want syrup in my martini and I've had better sushi from the grocery store.  I'd rather stay home."
0,Wish I'd read some previous reviews before I went here. If there isn't an event in the area go someplace else. Food was OK. If you want dinner in an empty warehouse this is the place to go. Service was OK but not great.
1,"A little more \""American\"" than the Vietnamese places we usually go to but the food was very good and the staff was very friendly and attentive. The place is pretty and very clean. It's pricier than most Vietnamese restaurants and they have fewer options but would probably go there again."
0,My wife and I was looking forward to playing a round of golf at Angel Park.  It was so overbooked that after hole #1 it took forever to play the course.  We could only get in 12 holes.  It was a rip off.  People were backed up 4-6 carts deep.  No Marshall or anyone policing the course.  Not a course that I would recommend.  Very unfriendly at the start.  People were complaining all over the course.  Another problem for first timers no signage on the course or beverage carts.  Water coolers were empty.  Sad course management.
0,Food was good. Service was poor.
1,Great diner food! I recommend the hanlons handful for breakfast! Great price and right amount of food.
1,"Great lunch spot, good sandwich and salads. The asparagus sandwich is my favorite!"
1,"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!\n\nThis place is great for a tasty treat! \n\nIf you don't speak spanish, good luck, I do a lot of pointing! It still works though!\n\nI have noticed that it is sometimes a little inconsistent as far as how well it is made, but still delicious non the less.  \n\nMy favorites so far are the Champango, and Escamocha when the fruit are actually ripe and not rock hard!"
0,"Oh My Dear God...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with one word: horrendous. \n\nMy boyfriend and I needed a place to eat and stay for a bit since we were just leaving the Mr. Olympia competition held that the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. Since the taxi and shuttle bus service was unbearably long we decided to be a little dangerous and cross the street in the pouring rain to this bar. After looking up the yelp reviews and seeing that people liked this place, we went in. I was immediately punched in the face by the awful smell of smoke and my ears bled immediately due to the bartender's foul mouths. There were three bartenders: Jason, Chris (who was female) and some other man who looked super stressed out and had a cold. I counted 31 times they said the F word. I'm not saying I'm prude or offended, I just think it is super unprofessional. \n\nWhen we walked in we sat down at the bar where there were about five others sitting. It took a bartender 13 minutes to even notice us and another 15 minutes to actually get us our drinks (which I refused to drink from the straw since the female bartender \""Chris\"" was using her hand to wipe away her runny nose continuously). \nMy boyfriend was hungry; however, we were so hesitant to order food from this place! We waited forever for someone to come by again after our drinks were given--the standard is to give drinks and provide a menu, hello?! We had to ask the bartender Jason if their kitchen was open and he pretended not to hear us until my boyfriend stood up and called out to him, then replied with a short rude \""ya.\"" Due to the cab wait being over an hour he went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich. This took about 25 minutes to come out. \n\nAs we were sitting at the bar I realized that the food was being placed right next to the registers when it was coming straight out of the kitchen. This is NOT good. The chef or runner was placing the food plates next to the dirtiest place in the bar--restaurant rule NEVER place food near money. GROSS. \n\nAlso, I believe the manager was there as well. I wanted to so badly confront him. However, he may have had a heart attack since he could barely breathe and move about the bar. I figured I'd save my own breath and just get the hell out of there.\n\n*Note: There were a lot of regulars. If you are not a regular you will be ignored. Not matter what."
1,This place is fantastic.  The staff is really friendly and professional. They were so quick I don't think they need to bother having chairs in the lobby.  Was in and out with cards in hand in less than 10 minutes.
0,"Came here for my first time for friday night dinner and waited for 10mins. for a host. Didn't get service even though the place was empty. We left. Get it together, it's a Friday."
0,"Lunch de semaine. Menu brasserie. Les plats sont corrects, mais la finition laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Beurre aromatis\u00e9 gel\u00e9 sur la bavette? Accompagnements minimalistes voire absents?

1,Great atmosphere.  The chicken and waffles are to die for.  Was disappointed with the lobster beignets.  They didn't really have any lobster in them.  My husband tried the meatloaf and that was outstanding.
1,"We decided to eat lunch here over the weekend for our first time. From the minute we sat down until the time we left, our experience was amazing! We started off with the Mozzerella cheese and tomato salad which was to die for, followed with Calamari which was also good though I still prefer Olive Garden for the calamari. We also had ahi tuna which was also really good. Our main course was a thin crust pizza which was the best I have ever had. My husband had the turkey club and my son had a mini pizza. The waitress was awesome, personable and honest. When they brough my sons pizza out, she came by the table and informed us that they had forgotten the pepperoni so they were make us a free one to go. We didn't even notice! First time I have ever had a resturant admit to wrong doing and fix it without asking! The only thing I would say was a shocker was the price. Not for the food but the drinks!! Just a regular ice and soda is like buying a whole case at the store. Other than that, the food was amazing and the service was excellent. Also, the restuarant was clean, decorated nice and did not echo so you had to shout to hear your table. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!"
0,"My review from last night was deleted so am reposting:\n\nI don't typically take the time to write reviews, but I want to add to the other poor reviews of this place because they are correct.  Everything here is overpriced, very small portions and average quality food.  We tried a variety of dishes all on our waiter's recommendations and were not impressed.  We were assured it was family style servings, but the portions were actually $2 side dish sizes for $20+.  Cosmo has a lot of great restaurants, this is not one of them."
1,"I took advantage of the travelzoo offer and only paid a little over $230 for 3 nights.  The yelp reviews pretty much cover everything about the hotel.  The buffet, service, housekeeping, rooms, etc. were great.  \n\nThe casino is not big nor small.  There is $5 blackjack and roulette at certain days and times.  There were a few areas in the casino where it was still under construction.  I can tell there were problems with the atm/cash redemption machine because I encountered one of them where it did not spit out enough money.  The supervisor was running from one atm/cash redemption machine to another to fix the situations.\n\nAs for the restaurants, I did try the Red Cup Cafe and the Studio B buffet.  The buffet exceeded my expectations and I think is one of the best.  Take advantage of the player's card as it gives you a few dollars off the buffet.  I ate at the Red Cup Cafe to satisfy my late 2am appetite.  I expected a mediocre taste in the meal from Red Cup Cafe, but was slightly above that.  \n\nExpect high winds in this area, which can make it uncomfortable to lay poolside.  I did have a neighbor next to me, but couldn't hear them.  Although, I could hear people talk in the hallways and hear doors slam, which can be very disturbing."
1,"Very nice environment, with good view to the music fountain. The service was nice too, the a little bit pricy."
0,"DIRTY CAR EVEN AFTER MOST EXPENSIVE CARWASH. \n\nThis has happened to me three times there now. Each time, I get a car wash/oil change with the most expensive wash. Each time they leave my cup-holders, parts of windshield, and inside of doors/dash DIRTY... even though I reminded them that I would like them cleaned. This last time, it really looked like they just vacuumed my car. Also, they are really too expensive for what you get. They also get mad/rude if you don't upgrade to all the things they offer you. The sales guy at the beginning got grouchy with me and literally stopped talking to me as soon as I said, \""No thank you\"" to a filter change."
1,"Very capable of 5 stars, and once things are operating a little more smoothly, this will be one of my favorites! Great food & amibience. The Devil's Eggs were incredibly good, as was the wild mushroom flatbread. My Mac & Cheese serving was really tiny, but I couldn't eat more than a few bites after appetizers, even though it was excellent. The one dish we all agreed needs to go was the black rice risotto. They really should paint the roof beams charcoal or silver; they really look like what they are rather than a nice open beam feel."
0,Why the heck did i try this place again? ... Horrible walked out service just awful didn't even order.
1,"First stop upon arrival from NYC!  It is basically a fast food restaurant with great fried chicken!  We ordered the whole chicken all dark meat with a sweet tea for 2.  The meal consist of 4 thighs and 4 drumsticks.  There was no seating inside the restaurant so we ate the chicken in the car.  \n\nChicken was amazing!!!  It was not too greasy and super crispy fried skins.  Although it was a tad salty and not as juicy as I wish it would be.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this first meal in Charlotte.  But I'm comparing it to some other fried chicken spots where the juice runs down your chin at each bite.  The sweet tea was very refreshing.  \n\nPrice's chicken coop was a great start to my trip to Charlotte."
0,"So disappointing!!! Came in because I heard great things, read awesome yelp reviews, and the menu online was enticing. We had monorail passes so getting there was easy. My husband and I both decided on the hash since it's what they're famous for. I'm a foodie and almost always order what a place is known for.... it's supposed to be the best choice, right? WRONG! First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn't even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable \""hash\"" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn't let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn't add anything. I didn't care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they're \""famous\"" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter. I'm allergic to dairy so there really wasn't any ignoring it... The server asked to take it back again but my husband's would have gotten cold.\n\nThe two stars are for the glass that I got to keep from my drink and for the server taking my meal off the check. Unfortunately, I don't understand the hype this place gets and I won't be coming back..."
0,My boyfriend said the black beans had no flavor and tasted like they came out of a can and the spanish rice had the texture from being in some sort of heat source for too long. I did not like their red chili as it was somewhat bland.  The ambiance and service was good though.

0,"these guys are absurd. \n\nrewind to june of 2012, my daughter was born, a doctor from here was sent to see us the day after, pretty sure all that was done was to check hearing or something, gave them our insurance information and thought we were done with it.\n\na few months later they called us complaining that the insurance company wouldn't pay them because my daughter was born a few days before her due date (no one else had a problem). so we called the insurance company and notified them of the situation, they acted like it was not a problem, called these guys back they said ok... that they would resubmit the bill.\n\nwe never heard another thing from them, no phone calls, no letters, no nothing. then fast forward to about an hour ago, i received letter in the mail from a collection agency saying that a bill from these guys was turn into them and they want money from me!\n\ni am deeply insulted and upset... why not call? why not send us mail? why not hire a competent person to run your accounting/billing?\n\ni will update this and let you know how they treat us when we call them on monday.\n\n\nedit update:\nthey were not of any help, their billing department messed up and was incompetent,  insurance company (old) says it was been to long and they  wouldn't cover the fee now. i decided to not put up with it and just payed the bill -afraid fighting it would put a mark on my credit report.\n\nso... yeah, they were not helpful and did not care."
1,We were traveling across country and went to this place based on yelp reviews. The food was fantastic and tasted sooooo fresh. It was so nice to have a home cooked meal. I was also very excited to try Nepalese food. I grew up in an area with just about any kind of food imaginable but I had never had Nepalese food and I'm hooked!
1,"I believe this place is a bit overhyped, but I'm gonna give the weekday brunch a try next time. \n\nFor an early Saturday dinner (6:30), I was thanking the heavens above that there was no line. We literally paid and got a table in seconds. Yay! We were starving from walking from Aria and getting lost looking for the place, but what was most disappointing was the variety. I felt like there wasn't as much stuff as Wynn and M Resort buffets. And even though all the dishes were made well, the dessert bar was also underwhelming. I saw all this delicious stuff but everything tasted mediocre. The only things memorable were the sauteed shrimp that's made to order, the risotto, and the gelato. The snow crab legs were cut so thin, and the bone marrow was pretty much all fat. I couldn't get myself to eat more than 1 bone marrow, so that was a bust. Also, the macarons from the dessert bar were too sweet and the texture wasn't right, either. I actually preferred the savory stuff over sweets this time, and that never happens at Vegas buffets for me! Their shrimp was definitely the highlight being so juicy and plump! They give you like four choices of butter to saute in, and ALL of them are amazing!\n\nOverall, I just had really high expectations for the dessert bar, and I was sorely disappointed. However, $22 for a weekday brunch sounds pretty good since their food is pretty fresh, and the only thing I love more than dessert is egg. It's worth giving it a try, but I prefer the M Resort buffet for dinner."
0,"I am a huge fan of Cirque de Soleil (i loved La Nouba, O, LOVE) and I was very excited to surprise my girlfriend and take her to see KA on her birthday.  I read the Yelp reviews and they were great, with most people saying this was their favorite show.  I could not have been more dissapointed.  We even had great seats (in the middle, not too close not too far) and the show was slow, boring and confusing.  There were some decent fight scenes and some talented performers but overall it was incredibly boring.  I can't beleive this was made by cirque de solieil and someone actually put it together and said yes this is what I want.  There was a period of about 45 minutes in the middle where we almost fell asleep and wanted to walk out.  The only reason we didn't is beacause I heard so many great things so I kept waiting for it to get better.  It was a joke.  We were in disbelief when it ended.  I felt like I was robbed of my money.  I had a locals discount of $130 for 2 tickets and I still felt robbed.  I wouldn't have even enjoyed it if I paid $20 per ticket.  It was that bad.  Seriously, I have always loved Cirque de soleil shows but this one was so boring.  There were hardly any acrobatics or anything that you couldn't see in a B rated kung fu movie.  The story was also confusing and made no sense.  Don't waste your time or money. Go see the Beatles LOVE show, O or even Absinthe.  They are all much better."

1,This is probably one of my favorite places in oldtown scottsdale. The bartenders make great drinks and the music is really good.
1,"Tired of the busy and often pricey food on the strip, wife and I decided to venture out to the Chinatown area in search of some alternatives.  Based on the Yelp review we landed at Monta, and was pleasantly surprised!  The ramen noodle are the thin firm style which we loved, and the tonkosu broth was excellent!  The place is small but cozy, waitress are friendly.  My only gripe is they don't have one in So Cal area where I live.  Definitely heading back there again."
0,"The worst! The only reason I stayed here because it's convenient to walk to the convention center for the show.\n\nFirst it's not clean, the house keepers knock early because they don't provide a do not disturb sign, and they put you in a smoking section and they don't ask if you want it or not and you tell them they wont move you even if your allergic to smoke, \n\nWould never recommend this hotel!"
0,"I was reminded this morning why I prefer the Chandler location over this one.  \n\nMy breakfast (eggs & bacon with pancakes) was perfectly cooked, but was unfortunately left in the window for far too long.  By the time it got to me, everything was pretty room temperature.  The butter wouldn't even melt that well on the pancakes.  Very disappointing."
0,"I bought a groupon for Planet Hugger last month. After 2 calls and 7 e-mails back and forth, I was able to schedule them to clean my house this Saturday. Angela said she'd contact me closer to the date to let me know what time to expect them.\n\nThis Tuesday I hadn't heard from her, so I e-mailed for the time. No response. I called and left a message on Thursday, and their answering service assured me that they'd call back in 24 hours. No response. I called this morning and spoke to Anthony. When I told him about the lack of responsiveness, he didn't apologize or even acknowledge what I'd said. He just asked for my phone number. He said someone would call me back later with the time. He wouldn't transfer me to a manager, he wouldn't tell me when they'd be available, he wouldn't give me a direct number, he wouldn't even tell me when they'd call back.\n\nI treat myself to a professional house cleaning once a year. I look forward to it all year. This company has me in tears."

[sniff]\n\nA couple of doors down from Maizie's (see reviews elsewhere  in Yelp), Sweet Venezia is a wonderful gelato store.  The gelato is the way gelato is supposed to be -- soft & delicioso.\n\nThe people are friendly & helpful.\n\nI have been back, and I will continue to go back.  I hope you like it as much as I do."
0,"This is the Arboretum Chili's.  You may have heard that Chili's corporately was going to respond to increasing pressure from places like Qdoba and Chipotle by greater emphasis on the Southwest dishes.  They definitely have made this change, and not for the better.  You can still find a few good old reliable burgers and salads that used to make this my go-to place for dinner with guests, but the new menu is so over-biased with Tex-Mex that the rest suffer.  Surprisingly the fajitas, long a staple at Chili's, were absolutely HORRIBLE.  The steak was tough and chewy .. and the portions reduced.  The new hot spicy taco shells they use for everything are also a horrible over-use of spice. After years of going here, my wife swore she'd never go again, it was that bad.  A shame."

1,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I almost never give 5 stars to any restaurant.  I reserve that elite status for a dining experience that is perfect in every respect.  While I am happy to give a cheap but tasty bbq shack high marks as a great value, I judge expensive gourmet restaurants extremely harshly.  I expect to get a great deal more on every level in exchange for the increased price.\n\nWith it's inventive and diverse menu that changes daily, upscale yet cozy atmosphere, friendly helpful service, generous portions and OUT OF THIS WORLD EXPERTLY PREPARED meals Eleven met and exceeded my sky high expectations.  \n\nMy wife and I were particularly impressed with the lamb taco and chocolate peanut butter pretzel desert.  The bar menu is just as amazing as their daily rotating menu, and about 50% the price ($10-$15 for most items) since the fair is more casual.  My wife got the pastrami sandwich and I got the eleven burger.  Both portions were MASSIVE and we had to take home left overs (can't wait to have them for breakfast tomorrow!)  The eleven burger was one of the best I've EVER had with perfectly cooked and seasoned ground meat so light and tender I can only describe it as fluffy!\n\nI would come back here for a special celebration meal any chance I get.  It's not cheap, but it is a great value and will be getting alot of quality and quantity for your money.  Eleven, I will be seeing you again!"
1,"Vegas prime.\n\nThe tower resort suites are where it is at. Stunning views from 2 sides, all the luxury that Vegas has to offer, and incredibly helpful service from all the staff. As with everything that Steve Wynn touches, this place was sheer gold, and the price point, while high, wasnt untenable. Especially if split 4 ways, it really is the size of two rooms at least, and you will have ample chilling/boozing/partying space.\n\nEverything in the hotel is new, clean, and high end. Yes, the rooms at the Palazzo may be slightly nicer, but they are also stuffier.  This was modern chic at its finest."
1,"I'm a regular at TJ The tasting table is the best I baked like a pastry chef from one of their recommendations this evening. Get the crescent rolls roll them out add 4-8  of there semi sweet chocolate chips roll them and bake for 13 mins. Top with their amazing  peanut butter cream cheese and call 911 cause you can't eat just one!\n\nThe staff is truly amazing and always goes out of their way to help .The pre made food is really good,Chicken Lasagna ,Turkey Meat Balls,and Panko breaded Tilapia  are always in my freezer.\n\nDon't forget the sweet tooth JoJos Ice Cream and these wicked peanut butter goodies will pick ya right up\n\nDollar for Dollar you can't go wrong and if anything I save more money shopping there then any place else\n\nGreen Valley location is the best of them all!"
0,"I have heard the saying that pizza is like sex, even the worst you can have is still not bad. Hmmm. Sounds like the person that made this up has the palette of a toddler, and well.. \nIf I was to find a sexual encounter equal to my pizza experience at the saucy tomato, I would probably say it would be the encounter that is so bad it makes you switch sexual orientation. \n\nPizza came in a decent amount of time I suppose, I take the box to my kitchen and open the box to expose a flat sloppy pizza folded over on one side to fit in the box. Sauce was everywhere and I was just in awe. Chicago pizza..is not thin. It looked like the cook had made it from a Chef Boyarde pizza kit. So I called and the girl that answered told me that if I wanted the Chicago style pizza I have to specify that when I order or else it comes the way we received ours. Well actually she said, \""Ummm if you want it, like, the other way, you have to like, ask for it. It comes whatever way you got it then. Wait, did you want it flat and didn't get it or..like the..hold on....(long ass pause)...Hello? wait, wait..what did you order again?\"" \nAfter explaining to her that I had ordered the Chicago style initially and received..something else entirely, she told me that the type of pizza I wanted would take longer, cool whatever! I am always nice and patient when it comes to my food and the people that handle it, I will wait for what I want no problem. They delivered it in about 15 minutes. The delivery guy demanded to see the pizza we did not want. He then told us there was nothing wrong with the pizza and 99% of them all look like that. He was wearing an apron and so I am sure he is the one that made it and does not like criticism. ( How you like me now asshole??) He said the fact that the pizza needed to be folded to fit in the box was like a bonus for us, and the sauce splattered all over the crust and pouring out the sides was also extra lucky for us. He was very aggressive and actually made us nervous this creeper knows where we live. He continued to yell at us about the pizza, us being two women with our very young childrenalso  at the door, also getting frightened. He then left and I was both relieved he was gone and pissed I over tipped him the first tie he was here. We took the pizza to the kitchen, opened the box, and the pizza was not even halfway cooked.The dough was almost fully raw and the cheese wasn't even slightly browned. I put it in the oven, really let the whole situation settle in and decided to NOT eat the pizza, take the $30 loss and eat a bowl of Fruit Loops. \nThe fact that order was messed up, that happens, it is not a big deal. The fact that the girl was totally unqualified to answer phones and take orders, whatever man she is probably 15 and its her first job so she is fine. But the fact that they sent a grown man twice my size to yell in threatening tone at me and my children is so way out of control I wouldn't believe it unless it happened to me. I wanted to call and complain to the store but my friend wouldn't let me as this fucking psycho knows were I live and if he couldn't take criticism for making a pizza badly imagine criticism about personal relations issues. \nThe whole situation gave me an epiphany about delivery. You never know who the fuck is coming to your house until it is too late. After this experience I will NEVER EVER AGAIN order delivery food to my home no matter how tired, hung over, late it may be, I will either drive my tired ass to the store, or once again go for a bowl of Fruit Loops."
1,"I have delayed writing this review as it has taken me sometime to put my thoughts in order regarding what might be one of the top 3 dining experiences of my life up until this point.\n\nFirst... It is a Thomas Keller restaurant.  Arguably one of the best chefs alive and a true master of the culinary arts.  If you can't appreciate this simply fact then you would be better off spending your money at McDonald's.\n\nThe atmosphere here is fantastic, if not a bit loud...  but then again, it's Vegas baby.  Menu's are on brown wax-type paper that will ring your napkin.  Our server was excellent, with out being overly pushy and was quite helpful in explaining questions we had on the menu.  He also didn't look at us in disgust when we joked about not being able to order anything in French, due to our limited linguistic abilities.\n\nNow... on to the food.  It was incredible!  I could leave it at that but I wont.  We had a group of five and started with multiple appetizers.  Specifically, we had the Escargot... delicious with the puff pastry on top,The Pork Belly Sausage... I believe the dates in this dish really make for a maple like flavor that is awesome, A selection of Oysters, most from the Pacific Northwest and all extremely fresh and grit free, and finally, the chilled Mussels.  I love Mussels but had not had them chilled before.  Again, they were fantastic.\n\nI had the Steak Frites for my entree.  The steak was excellently prepared and the frites were a golden, crispy, salty, wonderful experience.  The herbed butter on the steak was excellent as well.  My wife had the Roasted Chicken dish and it was phenomenal as well.\n\nTo finish I had the Chocolate Mousse, it was the richest, thickest, creamiest Mousse I've ever had... I loved it.  I was also able to sample the Apple Tart, and Beignets... both we as good if not better than the mousse.\n\nI can't recommend this place highly enough... in my mind it is a 'Can't miss\"" while in Vegas.  I am looking forward to buying the Bouchon cookbook and trying out some of these recipes.  If they turn out half as good at home as they did at the restaurant I'll be a happy guy!"
1,"Their show was a pure class act. I was somewhat familiar with them from their show on Showtime and it was great to see them up front, but I had not seen much of their slight of hand. The theater was a little larger than some I have seen, so try to get a seat closer to the front.\n\nThe pianist, Penn, and Teller greeted the audience after the show, which I thought was a great gesture of appreciation to the audience. I wish Georgie had been out there as well, as she was a part of my favorite act (not the fire-eating one, but another that I don't want to give away)."
1,One of my favorite places to eat. The food is great. In my opinion best burger in Phoenix. My only complaint is that the service is always slow. Pleasant but slow. I always enjoy my meal but leave a little annoyed at how long it took to get the bill and cash out.
1,"Although I am a Beatles fan, I must admit I was not psyched about seeing this show. I thought it may not live up to the standard cirque show because a few of my friends felt it was lame. I was overly impressed by the prediction and I really enjoyed it. I would completely see it again. It is family friendly and very affordable. Loved It :)"
1,"I am not at all a bar food person. I would call the Yard House upscale bar food, and I have liked everything I've ordered here. Their food is very solid. Their steak and ahi tuna salads are great, and I also like their burgers. I could seriously eat their fries and aioli until I throw up, so I deduct a star for tempting me to indulge in bulimia."
1,"What a delightful little bakery, and a fine place to practice your Espanol!  My husband's ex was Venezuelan and used to make arepas which was the one thing he misses from her so when I saw them on the menu I made sure to get him one (am I the best wife in the world or what??)  I also am a huge empanada-head so I got a couple of them, a delicious pastel de Gloria (dulce de leche filling) and guava turnover. Heaven!  It was definitely a quick and easy place to pick up some wonderful snacks.  \n\nIf you need a larger meal, they have one or two hot plates with combos in the bakery, or you can go next door (no sign!) to get full meals which we will try soon.   One new item they have in the bakery is a delicious mix of fresh shrimp, peppers and onions with garlic sauce on a \""plate\"" of fried plantains. The sauce is light and delicious and the plate is filling and crunchy.\n\nThe service was super friendly, and the owner was so sweet and embarrassed he gave me a passion fruit pudding/mousse instead of Goya when he didn't hear me say bebida.  His wife is also very nice and speaks English a lot more fluently, and was very helpful. I love the family as much as the food so it makes me want to go more!\n\nThere are places to sit down and eat if you desire."
1,"I disagree with the dated critical reviews others have written on this restaurant.  My husband, friends and I recently visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon before our flight.  The restaurant was clean and uncrowded.  \n\nThe house margaritas we ordered were delicious, generously sized, served in shakers, and left us all delightfully buzzed so we could better tolerate the oppressive coach seating  on our transcontinental flight.  \n\nThe waitress informed us the restaurant only pours Cuervo because the company that owns Jose Cuervo also owns the restaurant. \n\nEveryone in our group commented on how much they enjoyed their food.  My husband loved the crab cakes he was served.  The carnitas quesadilla I ordered was incredibly good.\n\nEach person in our group was pleasantly surprised with the superior quality of the food and drink we were served. Such high caliber and tasty offerings are a welcome relief from the bland fare usually served at most airport restaurants. \n\nI look forward to visiting this restaurant again the next time I travel to Charlotte. ."

0,"This updated review is a direct reflection of the massage portion of my recent visit to Just For You.  My best friend was in town so we decided to treat ourselves to the Half Day Package. I provided this feedback and after a week, I have heard nothing.  I have amended some content due to character limits here: \n\n     I was so pleased with Heather's technique (during the facial portion of the appointment) and the session was a raging success from my perspective.  I was extremely relaxed when my facial was over and I was invited into the massage room by Allison.  \n\n     As a Licensed Massage Therapist myself, I do have some expectations for a massage session and understand every therapist is different and no two sessions are the same. Unbeknownst to me, my best friend had already told Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist; I did not share with Allison that I am a Licensed Massage Therapist myself and I did not know that she had already been told.  I did not want her to feel like I would be \""testing\"" her in any way. With that in mind, I climbed onto the quite high massage table and settled in for what I was hoping would be a therapeutic session as \""Allison specializes in stress reduction, sports massage, and relaxation massage.\""  I work two jobs and had not received bodywork in almost a year.  \n\n     I can best summarize the session by sharing that Heather had a more therapeutic and relaxing touch than Allison did.  Allison talked for the first 10 minutes of what turned out to be a 45 minute (not an hour) session.  She seemed more interested in my main job title than in seeking feedback about her pressure.  Not wanting to jump the gun and to ensure I provided her ample time to check in regarding the pressure, I waited.  Allison proceeded to tell me by back was \""loosening up nicely\"" which was not an accurate statement in the least.  Allison kept moving over an area that was tense due to a poor sleeping position days earlier, something had I mentioned mid-session, and instead of applying direct pressure to ease that tension, she caused soreness and inflammation with the repeated palpation of the site.  After having me move into a supine position, Allison proceeded to begin an abdominal massage that felt very awkward and insecure.  To successfully conduct an abdominal massage, a towel or cloth heavier than the sheet already on the body should be used over the chest so when the sheet is pulled toward the feet to expose the abdomen, the client does not feel exposed.  Ideally, a conversation would have been had with the client regarding the area as it is not typically an area of the body where most people are comfortable receiving bodywork.  I am trained and experienced in abdominal massage and I found myself questioning what was happening before I realized that abdominal work was next.  Courtney shared with me that she, too, had felt awkward during this part of the session as she felt like she was just having her stomach rubbed and didn't really understand the purpose of the technique.  She also shared that she had asked Allison for more pressure during her session and Allison complied, providing more pressure for about a minute and then resuming her previous technique.    \n\n     To make matters more awkward, when we were at the front desk waiting to pay for our services, Allison stood there waiting for payment.  Heather and the other staff member at the desk were on the phone and Courtney and I were happy to wait for them to finish.  Allison even made mention that she didn't know how to finalize the payment portion of the visit but then attempted anyway, losing patience with the two servicing the clients on the phone.  When she was able, Heather apologized for the wait and we honestly had no issue waiting our turn.  When Allison decided to conduct the payment collection herself, I explained to her that we had had a package session that day.  She then gave us the total of $139 when the package price was $135.  I corrected her, even showing her the package I had already mentioned in the brochure, and she accepted our payments for $135.  It was only when it came time for us to add our tips and sign our receipts that Allison seemed to have an interest in our sessions and how we were feeling.  At that point, I just wanted to leave.  I was so utterly disappointed and honestly felt like I had wasted the money that paid for the massage portion of the package as there was nothing relaxing or therapeutic about what transpired during that session.  As we were leaving, Allison reminded us to \""drink lots of water\"" and I thought to myself, \""For what?\""  She didn't do anything that promoted a need for water in addition to what I already consume. \n\n     I wanted to bring my experience to your attention as I truly feel that, although her technique may be appreciated by some, it has confirmed that I will not be booking another massage session at Just For You."
0,"This place is awful! \n\nMy friends and I were there when we were in town for a car show last night. It took 40 min to get a soda, but I was offered wine twice. And it was the wrong soda. We had to figure out how it all worked. \n\nThe Buffett part was constantly out of something. Our glasses were almost always empty. We had the green up all the time and still never tried the lamb, and who knows what else we missed. \n\nOur server had his tie down and shirt untucked acting like he was pisses to even be there. Then when we finally left after almost 2 hours we had a bill for $200 for four people that they would not split (that's with no alcohol). My friend said it best when we walked out the door and he said \"" I feel like I just got mugged.\"" I am mad I have to give it one star."
1,"Great beer selection, especially the beer fusions. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, quick service. Food is typical bar food, nothing special but didn't agree with my girlfriends stomach in the least. So four stars for the beer and atmosphere but wouldn't eat here."
0,"I went back for a third time today, Saturday at 1:30 PM.The second visit was really bad. Today was better but only up to 2*s.This time there might have been as many customers as employees? On my 2nd visit I did not get the senior discount even after\nagain requesting it  Today again told the lifeless \nhost I am a senior. My bill again was full price but was adjusted. The waitress works hard and is pleasant but zero contact  beyond plate pick up. I again enterred and left with two words being said.Thevfood was passable to poor. There was nothing good.\nI am very easy to please."
1,This place is nothing to look at! Be prepared to wait at least an hour outside. Cash only! Way better than ANY NYC deli for Corned Beef. At Schwartz's it is called 'Smoked Meat'. Get it on a plate with bread on the side. You will NOT be disappointed!!!
0,"The cold weather was killing my battery performance.  Like the car is sputtering and the battery does not have enough juice to turn the engine on.  I felt so helpless with the prospect of potentially being stranded somewhere or not being able to get to work.  So I ordered a replacement battery, and decided to head to Walmart and have their auto service department install the battery for $10 (that's what their website stated as one of the services offered).\n\nSo with a really deep saving on a premium battery I ordered online, I drove to Walmart Supercenter.  But the auto service department said they don't install batteries unless it was purchased from Walmart.  WTF?  Do I need to print out the Walmart webite and show you what services you do offer?\n\nAnyway, nothing was done, so I did the dirty work myself and saved the $10.\n\nNot a happy camper, but getting your hands dirty and doing something on your own is noticeably rewarding.  Not looking forward to it, but I know I can do it if I wanted to.\n\n2 stars!"
0,I am probably the only person who really does not like this place. First time I thought all the desserts taste like bread there was no difference in the quality between the bread and the pastry. So again I gave them a chance my son wanted to try them all tables were full so we ordered something to go. After people were getting their food and we were still standing there I went to the register she went to the chef and he yells out can' t you see I am busy. Well I guess too busy to take care of customers as there were plenty of people in street clothes in the back grabbing food talking to the help etc. I won't be back
1,This place is awesome. The food is great. Nice and spicey! Best thai food in Vegas!

Just know that if your product is defective, you don't get get refunds here. \n\nOk experience during check out.

1,"Oh, why oh why didn't I just order the falafel platter?!?  I would have just liked, and not loved, Sabuddy Israeli had it not been for the $.50 falafel I had on the side of my shawarma sandwich.  The pita sandwich was good, but not having shawarma before I discovered it is not my favorite Israeli cuisine.  It was well seasoned with yellow curry all the way through the chicken, not overpowering but I just don't seem to care for yellow curry.  The pita also had tomato, an israeli pickle, lettuce (with a touch of lemon) and tahini.   \n\nI ended up ordering four falafel balls total, in addition to my sandwich.\nThey are the perfect combination of hand ground garbanzo beans, garlic and a hint of cumin.  They are crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  All other falafels fail in comparison.  Next time I visit I solemnly vow to order the falafel platter complete with tabboulah, hummus and babaganooj."
0,"I have been to this Anthro probably about 4 times, I have been to Anthros all over the country as my job requires travel. They are all very friendly with the exception of this one, they never welcome you when you come In And when I bought something today they did not even say thank you. It's not any one person because I'm sure they have been different every time. It's just this one the girls here are the most unfriendly lack of disregard for the customer I have ever had. Go to Scottsdale much friendlier!"
0,"I have to disagree with Gabi on this one.  It could be me, but I have been here three times now, and each time, I have received terrible service.  I understand how some could love this place; it definitely has a unique atmosphere, but...when I get attitude with my beer, you lose me."
1,"I showed up at 9:00 am on Sunday for yoga and t was great. There were some really advanced people as well as some beginners. Everyone mixed really well. We also had a special instructor too. \n\nI didn't buy anything at this store, but judging by how nice everyone was at yoga, I am sure the retail help here is great. \n\nI do own tons of Lululemon apparel though and  it has great quality and really takes the wears and tares well."
0,Maybe it is just my server but I waited 20 minutes after getting my wings and asking for blue cheese and silverware :(
0,"Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. No refridgerator, no microwave, no help!! My wife, duaghter,and I went to Vegas to see our oldest child have her first baby. We stayed a week. During that week we experienced thier mediocore casino, atrocious buffet, and the most expensive bagel I've ever had. I can get over the prices because, hey, it's Vegas. But when my daughter wanted to stay and visit with us the day after she had her son we were charged $20 for a wheelchair!! That did it for us. We willl never go back and I recomend you stay clear of this place."
0,"I was looking forward to going back to The Riviera.  Years ago, if one wagered twenty bucks, they one an awesome embroidered denim jacket.  It had the desired effect, we pitched a tent there and gambled.\n\n    Not this time.  That promotion is gone, as is \""Nickel Town\"", which used to be attatched.\n\n    I only saw one waitress on the main slot floor, blonde, a little tall, short haircut.  She scowled and attempted to make no eye contact.   Hey lady, I am a good tipper, and you don't even know me yet, what is with the hostility.\n\n    We left.  We didn't give the Riviera a dime.  I worry about this end of the Strip and wish the R the best, but it didn't seem like the same place."
1,Prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to. Standard items like fried rice and lunch specials are about $9.
0,I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
1,"Best way to travel in the trip. Saves money and time. Very Good Air-conditioning keeps you cool and protected from the hot weather outside giving a perfect way to enjoy the view of the strip. \n\n1) It would be great to have the same kind of ticket machines in all stops as not all bus stops vend all ticket types. And, some accept cash, some don't; some accept cards, but some don't\n2) The machines are hidden in the rear in many of the stops. We could see people scrambling around to see where's the machine. Adding a board pointing to where the machine is, would be helpful. \n3) It is confusing which door to board. Deuce boards you from front door. But people get confused when they transfer from the other bus Strip and downtown Express(Route SDX) which allows to board from rear doors as well. There can be a common way of boarding the bus."
0,This place doesn't even deserve a freakin star at all. Took my 97 jeep down to get an exhaust cutout on it. Crappy weld job. Made me have an exhaust leak to were I kept stalling out. And then they broke my 02 sensor on my cat. Wtf?! And I took it down to Midas and they even said that they broke it. And wrote up a statement saying that it was. And when I took it back down there. They just laughed. And freakin said hell no. And wouldn't do anything about it. \n\nStay away from this place. These guys are assholes. And treat you like crap.
1,"Wow! Went their on a whim and was pleasantly surprised to enjoy some of the best Thai food I've had in years. The atmosphere was relaxing, the staff polite and attentive. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
0,"I hate the fact that I have to give this place such a low rating. Many aspects of it kick ass. I came to Vegas 9/25/13  for my honeymoon and spent my last night at the D. At check in I specifically asked for a nice room and would pay more. What they gave me was a room that was standard and next to the stage outside that blared music until late into the night. After complaints, we were moved to a better room that was quieter. Needless to say, we love old Vegas  but will stay somewhere else next time"
0,"My husband had gone to a different location than Ahwatukee and said how great it was.  He stopped on the way home from work one night and got us a pizza.  I was not real impressed, thought the sauce was a little sweet and the crust was just ok, kind of soggy.  A few weeks ago we tried again and ordered the specialty spinach pie.  It was delivered cold and super soggy.  Was so bad we couldn't eat it so I called and spoke  to the manager and he gave us a credit for another pizza.  Tried it again tonight.  This time we ordered thick crust half mushroom half sausage.  It was disgusting!  Came cold again, the crust was so dry that is cut the inside of my mouth.  Sauce has way too much sugar in it.  We won't be going there anymore.  We each ate one piece then threw the whole large pie away, what a waste!!  The salad also had the wrong dressing with it and the lettuce was warm and wilty.  Sorry Spinato's but just being honest."
0,"This is probably the second to last dermatologist on your list of doctors to see. This is a long delayed review, but I had out my experiences in the back of my mind until we met a strange character, Dr. Saul from AD at a Yelp event earlier this month.\n\nThe last time I saw Dr. Schreiber was over a year ago when I went to him for a reoccurring rash I had on my stomach (which would spread to other parts of my body). I sat waited in the office for 30-40 minutes with an appointment made the week prior, then waited for the doctor for about 20 minutes as I dressed into the paper coverings I was left. Dr. Schreiber came in, told me that the rash was due to metal contact from the button in jeans with my skin and wrote me a script for medication used to treat scabies and psoriasis without any real direction other than to apply the cream and lotion twice daily. I filled the prescriptions, and the medication was messy so application wasn't really clean cut. The medication didn't work, but I was too turned off by my first experience to come back to this office. \n\nAfter some research, I was able to come up with my own prediction- I may have been intolerant of an iron supplement added to a medication I was taking. I had the prescription changed and like magic, the rash cleared up completely within a few months. I would have preferred had he offered an allergy test or biopsy of some sort to conclude a diagnosis, but I guess he didn't have the time. \n\nI would compare a visit to this office to a visit to your local UMC Quick Care. There's very little compassion from the front desk for their long wait times, and the doctor makes a quick diagnosis with no follow-up what-so-ever. Maybe in some cases, his diagnosis is correct and his treatment works. In my case, it did not but thankfully I am now able to manage my skin condition."

He was always willing to offer suggestions even tho he wasn't doing any formal training with me. Finally, I decided to step-up to his challenge.\n\nHe is a  50+ guy, that is ALWAYS in competition condition (both in mind and body). He competes and places virtually every time he competes. How many of your trainers can say that??? Tracy has helped to reshape my training and nutrition. I am getting in the best shape that  I have been in since college.  He is a wealth of knowledge and truly preaches nutrition and training habits that simply work.\n\nIf you are tired of running in circles, take MY challenge.....give him a month.

0,"The Patio Restaurant is definitely not the best restaurant in Edinburgh. It doesn't look much on the outside, and to be honest, it is isn't up to much inside either. Situated in Hanover Street, The Patio Restaurant is in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and so it should be hot spot for people going for lunch and dinner, but its not - because it is awful!\n\nThe inside of The Patio Restaurant is really drab and dull and could definitely do with a revamp. I came here for lunch one day and I was really disappointed with my whole experience. This is an Italian restaurant, serving pizzas and pastas, but not that well. I ordered a peperoni pizza which hardly had any topping or cheese, and it was literally dripping in grease - it is something which I would only normally eat on my way home for a night out, not for a nice lunch. The prices were very reasonable here though, with most main courses costing under six pounds. The staff were friendly enough and the portion sizes were fairly decent. \n\nThere are much better Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of your custom."
0,"*WARNING* VERY POOR VALUE\n\nI've never posted so strongly before but I felt I must warn people strongly.\n\nRead my ratings I've VERY FAIR - I eat out a lot at a huge variety of places... hole in the wall (like Contigo) all the way to $150-200 person meals\n\nI bought the Yelp coupon after reading good reviews... it was a bad move.  I've had good and great Peruvian food in many places. This is average, at best.\n\nThis place should be WAY cheaper due to...\n- plain & cheap decor (low-end)\n- located in  low-end strip mall in low end part of town\n- low quantity of food they give \n- VERY hungry when we left.  ordered 2 dishes, 1 appetizer, and 3 alcoholic drinks... $80+ with tip! \n\nWe went on a week night for dinner... we were the ONLY people there the entire 1.5 hrs.\n\nSpecifics...\n\nPisco Sour - 1 star\n-- Nothing special for flavor. I've had much better Pisco Sours double the size for less $...$6 for a 6 ounce glass which was mostly ice is a rip off! \n\nShrimp Ceviche - 2 stars\n-- They cared more about presentation than quantity or flavor. $15+ that was the size of my fist. Should have been at least 2x the size it was for the price.\n\nMain Entrees - 2 stars\n-- flavors were fine but nothing special. food quantity was half the size it should have been.\n\nthen to top it off... I added wrong on the check and the $10 I would have saved with the coupon was canceled out... and the owner did not even mention it to me... and charged my CC the wrong amount. So... either he did not check the #s or he was dishonest.\n\n\nMAYBE this place has decent lunch specials, and I'm being VERY GENEROUS with that assumption."
0,"Let me start off by saying this place had a steady retained customer until they showed their true colors... I absolutely loved their crab fried rice and greasy soup until one afternoon I ordered their soup with half cooked fish which was absolutely nauseating... I waited for my order over one hour when I order an hour before the food was prepared... The hostest has to be a complete idiot, because when I came to pick up my food she kept telling oh it'll be a few minutes after waiting an hour I left after paying for my food. I told this goof troop that I'll be back for my money and a word with the manager once I get off of work. So I called in one of my rant fits and the hostest said 'Ohhh your Sarena it's been sitting here since you paid' I mean really wtf... You took my money but kept playing the wait game. I was infuriated asked one of my co-workers to pick up the food... After all the waiting the sugar honey iced tea was horrid... Never again"
1,Thit Heo Nuong is Amazing! Great Happy Hour!
1,So good...so so so good!  Be careful not to pick too many things from the carts...it adds up fast.  Five of us racked up $100 bill...so worth it...yummy!!
0,"Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""bacon\"" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food."
0,As we were being seated I was greeted by a cockroach on the wall who made its way on the conveyer belt. A staff member did pursue to roach but I was unable to confirm his kill. I still decided to give this place a try and it legitimately made me feel sick and it was not my first sushi experience or anything like that. I don't know if I'm just really unlucky but non of the sushi from the conveyer belt was even kinda fresh. My recommendation is to pay a bit more and actually enjoy your food and not struggle to finish.
0,Overpriced... The rolls kept falling apart and the flavor was not there. The albacore did not taste as fresh as I would've hoped. Definitely had better sushi. Probably wouldn't go back.
1,"I just went there with 4 co-workers for lunch.  Everybody was happy with their food, which was: pizza, Stromboli (yummy) and calzones (huge).  The staff was friendly and the prices are fair.\n\nThe only negative is a lack of seating.  Just note in advance that there is only counter seating inside.  This would be a great place to grab something to go."
0,"Squishy/soggy/slimy french toast, no substitutions without being charged, and initially seating us in the worst possible seat available (in-front of entryway/kitchen)= 2 stars.  \n\nApparently it costs them $0.25 worth of brain power to use an alternate ingredient.  I am one of those annoying people that modifies menu items because I don't like some things that are standard to some dishes.  i.e.  avocado, sour cream, some cheeses, mayonnaise, and the list goes on...so I was not a very happy camper when I was told it was a $0.25 charge to substitute anything.  If I was still 8 years old, my breakfast would have cost me $30.  I can understand if I add something, but substitutions- that is stupid!  And according to my sister they need to change a few things with their French toast."
0,"This is the second time I have dined at Yummy Sushi.  The first time we dined here it was by chance; we were hungry and we're just cruising Lake Mead Blvd looking for a place to eat.  Had I written the review the first time, I would have given 4.5 stars.  The fish was fresh and delicious. We tend to get nigiri and sashimi only. The server was friendly and the sushi chefs too.\n\nWe had the same server and she is very friendly and nice.  Now, here is where it all goes awry.  We order a couple of hand rolls, it was good.  I love yellow tail, so I requested an order of hamachi nigiri.  The sushi chef prepares it and hands it to me while my man is away in the bathroom.  I look at it and it does not look like yellowtail.  I take one small bite and I can barely bit into it.  On top of that he tried to add something to the fish to make it more edible.  I still don't know what it was.\n\n My man comes back from the bathroom and I look at him and he says \""what is that?\""  I said, \""supposedly yellowtail\"".  My man takes a bite, looks at the sushi chef and says \""Yellowtail??\""  He only said one word with a question in his voice and the sushi chef immediately says, \""oh so sorry I give you better piece, I accidentally give you piece that was bleeding\"".  What???  I have been eating sashimi for 15 years now, my man a little longer.  We know good sashimi.  He tried to pull one over on us and I felt really insulted.  He shouldn't be serving that to anyone, even if they hadn't known the difference.\n\nShame on you owner and sushi chef! (slap on the hand)  I thought I had found a great place to have sushi in town, now I will have to resume my search.  I never mess around with raw fish, all it takes is one bad experience for me to scrap a place.  Your place is officially scrapped Sir!  I know I am a dissenting review and perhaps he was having a *moment* whatever. SCRAPPED!"
1,"I'm a fan. Fun, Friendly, Family environment. Good old Crab cracking. Place is just clean enough to let you know seafood eaten goes down in here!  Staff was great, food was tasty, they have cold beer, they have tv's, they have seafood.  #winning"
1,"Located by Ft Apache and Tropicana, in the plaza with Tropical Smoothie (actually right next to it) and Perfect Scoop & Boba. \n\nIt is a rather small resturant with maybe 8 tables that seat 4 people each. It hasn't been that busy each time I've came here so it's not too bad. The staff is very friendly and don't really constantly check up on you. I however, kind of need someone to check up frequently because I tend to drink a lot of water and rather fast too (maybe I'll ask them to leave the pitcher next time). \n\nCame here a few times to eat, the tofu soups are about $8.95 each and the combos I believe are around $15 (I haven't gotten any of them yet). The tofu soup along with the appetizers fill me up every time so I'm afraid to try something bigger unless I end up sharing with someone. They have some variety in their menu, but I come mainly for the tofu soup. \n\nI've tried the beef tofu soup, ham and sausage (would not recommend this one, because it's slices of ham and hot dogs), and dumpling ones so far. There's a lot of meat in each of them which is good, but I would rather have more soup since I don't eat a lot of meat. I fill up rather fast with the soups + rice and then the appetizers and generally have leftovers too. I tried the tofu soups each time as spicy and to me they're not spicy at all (though extremely hot). \n\nI definitely like coming here and then over to Perfect scoop for dessert if I have room (I usually don't, but I'll do take out for the ice cream)."
1,All the meat they brought to the table was supurb.  From lamb to beef and bacon wrapped chicken...all luscious.\n\nStaff was quite attentive even though a sea of tables were filled...very busy.\n\nTypical decor and atmosphere of a stylish restaurant.\n\nGreat combo of sit-down and buffet service.\n\nNothing I can say to knock this place.\n\nP.S. Even the gal who answered the phone during dinner hour was polite and attentive.
1,"Let me tell you this place is trickey.  Outside they advertise breakfast for $5.99 or $6.99 but no where on the menu is there an item that starts at that price.  Everything is more like $12 and up.  So i asked our server and thank god i did, there is like 6 things he named off for that price including steak and eggs.  It was a good cut of steak cooked perfectly.  A little grissley but for that price it was more then I expected. French toast was amazing, I mean I dont usually like them but these were great. Our server was a little aloof but he got better towards the end and even got me a diet coke to go.  I think its because we tipped 50% but hey it was christmas day."
1,One of the best customer service experiences I had during my search for a bridal gown. The ladies there were super helpful and accommodating. Same day appointments are available during the week but there is usually 1-2 week wait for a Saturday appointment. The store carries Essence of Australia and Enzoani gowns. They were all beautiful but the selections were limited (minus 1 star).
0,They let me ride out of there on an unsafe motorcycle then tried to get me to pay for what need to be fixed. Bald tire and a drive belt that was coming a part. I still ended up having to pay for the belt. \nDon't get taken for a Ridenow at Ridenow
1,"I'm going to jump on the 5 star bandwagon here. And for one simple reason:\n\nMACARONS.\n\nOccasionally, the Mr will bring me a delightful, sweet offering after visiting the 7th Street Public Market. More often than not, it's a toothsome treat from barCHOCOLATE. Yesterday, I received a hazelnut macaron and a key lime macaron.\n\nAnd I fell in love with the key lime macaron. I shared with the Mr, but not because I wanted to. I wanted to savor every last morsel of the thing.\n\nI don't know what sorcery they use to create their macarons. And I don't care. I just want another one. Right now."
0,"Never again! I was supposed to be picked up at 6:15 at my hotel. The bus never came. I called the dispatcher and the bus driver said I missed the bus and he wouldn't be coming back. This was not true. The dispatcher told me to take a cab to the meeting point and I would be refunded - we'll see if I'm actually provided a refund. The meeting point was a chaotic mess, and I realized I was on only one of 11 packed buses. If you take th\u00eds tour, be prepared to be just one of ~600 travelers headed to the Canyon - and all 11 buses made the same stops, so restroom lines were a nightmare and the lunch buffet took 30 minutes to get through because there are only two small buffet service areas. The staff at the lunch restaurant were quite rude and inefficient, but that's not GCT's fault.\n\nFinally, the bus is cramped (much smaller than an airplane seat). With stops, lunch, and traffic getting into the park, expect a 7.5 hour trip from your hotel to the park and then another 5+ hour journey back to your hotel. Also, I was not dropped off at my hotel but rather across the street and one long block up.\n\nDo yourself a favor and do not take the day trip - maybe one of GCT's VIP tours are easier on the nerves."
1,"There's so much over-priced bad food to be had in Vegas.  I discovered Hash House a couple years ago, and make it a point to stop in when I'm in Vegas.  4 stars instead of 5 because the staff isn't super friendly...semi-friendly I'll say.\n\nCoffee is good not great. Bloody Mary was good not great.\nScrambles are good, and so are the Benedicts.  I tend to over-order here because everything sounds so fantastic.  I encourage sharing an egg dish and a pancake. It's plenty."
1,"Despite not being much of a \""sandwich eater\"", I've always been a fan of Goodcents. Not because I think they're sandwiches are any better than Quizno's or their decor any more aesthetically pleasing than Subway's, but because they're the most honest sub shop I've ever come across.\n\nEven though sandwiches can be good for you, you don't see some asshole running around with a sandwich board that reads \""MR. GOODCENTS SUBS WILL MAKE YOU SKINNY! OH...AND THE END IS NEAR!\"" And even though they cut their own meat, you don't hear them advertising this one particular aspect of their business at every opportunity.\n\nOMG A FUCKING TOASTER? YOU CAN TOAST SUBS! OH MY GOD THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING THING EVER? IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN USUAL SUB SHOPS BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE IT'S TOASTED, IT'S BETTER AND MORE FILLING! TOASTED'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nThey make sandwiches. That's really all there is to it. \n\nThey keep their bread in giant plastic bags because although it's unappetizing looking, it actually preserves the freshness, as opposed to keeping bread stored in a hot, humid cabinet just above the oven where it will begin to absorb the taste of the bread it's crammed up against (Yeah, I got your fucking number, Subway). \n\nThey cut their meat and cheese fresh because that's actually what you're supposed to do, rather than pre-slice it and pre-package it so it can stew in its own juices while it gets shipped out to the nearest chain location (My Ultimately Worthless Factoids-2, Subway-0).\n\nThey're subs might be healthy, but probably not. Judging by the large number of heavy-set people (including myself) who frequent Mr. Goodcents, I think it's safe to say that all that meat and cheese probably isn't doing our hearts any favors. But then again I know people who only order the salads at McDonald's or the veggie at Subway who'd make a dietitian piss themselves and faint. \n\nThe last couple of times I've been to Goodcents I admittedly had no interest in purchasing their sandwiches. The diuretics I'm on right now force everything out of me, so I've currently been on an all-soup diet. A bowl of ramen or a cup of Campbell's Soup At Hand contains both the water I need and the sodium to help me retain said water. \n\nGoodcents has, for a sandwich shop, amazing soups and pastas. The chicken noodle itself is worth a visit or two, as is there chicken alfredo or pasta salad. \n\nPlagued with the flu, I stumbled in last Wednesday with a few bucks in my pocket and a craving for something hot and liquid to sip slowly. While my friend was harassing one of the girls at the counter (what guy sees a girl putting meat through a cutter and goes \""yes, she seems like a suitable mate\""?), I gave another  my order.\n\n\""Chiggen soup, please. A half.\""\n\""Just a half? Are you sure? You sound like you need it.\""\n\""Just a half's fine.\""\n\""Tough. I gave you a full. You sound sick.\""\n\""Oggay. Thagg you.\""\n\""You're a student, right? Show her (the cashier) your student ID and you'll get a free drink. You need all the fluids.\""\n\""Yeah. Tell me about it. Thagg you zo much.\""\n\""Don't mention it.\""\n\nLater that day, while my co-workers were arguing Subway vs Quiznos and discussing what should and should not go on a meatball sub, I sat quietly, sipping at my chicken noodle soup and lemonade, thinking that I could get use to this 'flu' thing.\n\nOh, I couldn't fit this into a clever phrase but the soup comes with a side of buttery bread. It's amazing. You wouldn't think that buttery bread and chicken soup went together, but a few years ago you probably sat there in front of your TV and said \""Toasted subs? Yeah, that's a passing fancy if I ever saw it.\""\n\nYou know what I've been looking for? A deli that makes good PB&J sandwiches. Anyone who can bring me this information will be given my secret recipe for the ultimate bloody mary."
1,"Came here last night for the first time and had a great experience at TopGolf. From the second you walk in the door the staff was really friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable in helping you figure out how to get situated.\n\nThe facilities are incredible, and the bar on the main level is large which makes for a nice sports bar environment. They've also got billiards tables, Xbox Kinect, and Fooseball to make sure that even the kids are entertained when not hitting golf balls.\n\nHaving three floors of hitting bays is awesome, and I definitely recommend getting on the top floor. Being able to look out over the field and seeing the targets is really cool. This is definitely no \""driving range\"", people that would consider themselves moderate to very good golfers should not need anything close to a driver when hitting balls here (okay, maybe the ladies but definitely not the guys). The experience is more about target shooting and racking up points in their pre-programmed games, not hacking balls as far as you possibly can.\n\nI'll for sure be back at TopGolf, the entertainment value is high for everyone even if you're not into playing the links or taking swings at a regular range."
1,"The veggie chili is not as good as it used to be and the parking is scary but that's only worth a one star dock.  Where this place REALLY makes up for it is the service, fantastic staff and the banana pudding.  Do NOT leave this place w/o ordering the banana pudding.  Also the menu is pretty unique overall  \n\nI didn't realize a coupon I had was for the Huntersville location but they had no problems honoring it! :)"

1,Went outside my comfort zone and ordered bbq oysters and the Rockefeller oysters...both awesome but favored the bbq ones.. calamari was good not chewy.....my waiter was an older gentleman(James) and he was awesome also...most definitly coming back...\n***!!!!!!! They took the Bbq oysters off the menu :(
0,"Want some onions with your Thai food??? I mean seriously, I hope you really, really, really LIKE onions because apparently it's a \""filler\"" for their entrees and a gratuitous one at that. I had a cold so I figured some spicy Tom Ka soup would clear up my head. I order that, my usual which is Pad Woon Sen with Beef and the Special Pumpkin Curry. The total was $32 before tip on the delivery which seemed really high for what I got. Let's start with the soup, the first thing I notice is that there aren't a lot of colors in the container when I take the lid off, just the milky white broth and about, no kidding, 2 whole sliced onions and a few shards of chicken and maybe 3 mushroom slices. This was basically a coconut soup with onions. Horrible. Next the Pad Woon Sen, it's clear bean thread noodles, usually with veggies, fried egg and sauteed meat. I ordered the beef but go the chicken. The noodles were glopped together in a solid mass. I know this is not just a facet of \""delivery\"" because I order this dish from Swaddee Thai delivered all the time and it's not a solid glop of stuck together noodles. It was tasteless and filled with baby corn, again, a cheap canned filler. Lastly the special pumpkin curry. Apparently the only thing special about it is that it costs $10. It was the exact same color sauce as the Tom Ka soup, same flavor too. I dumped it all out in a big bowl and there were only a couple super thin slices of pumpkin, the rest was, you guessed it, white onions. What the heck is with the onions???? It also had green bell pepper that was cooked so much that it melted in your mouth and not in a \""wow this is amazing\"" way but in a cooked to DEATH kind of way. The carrots in BOTH the pad woon sen and the no-pumpkin pumpkin curry were brown around the edges, disgusting. Overall, this was some of the worst Thai food I've ever had. All three dishes had the same lousy note. The quality was low, ie, overcooked veggies, brown veggies, non-existent main ingredients, etc. It was expensive and basically all got dumped down the garbage disposal. I would not recommend that anyone eat here. I'm sorry I lost $32 PLUS tip! Such a shame because there aren't a lot of Thai delivery places around here. Save your money, go to Swaddee, Thai Basil or Yupha's."
0,This place is an embarrassment to Mexican food. You couldn't pay me to come back here. The food was disappointing and the service was weak. Can't wait to see what replaces this dump in a few months.
0,"I live downtown and was sooooo excited that we had yet another restaurant to visit..... especially since it is the same owner as AZ88 which I love!  \n\nWent for lunch with my bf and we both started out with a martini.  Mine had St. Germain in it and I couldn't wait!  We waited... and waited.... they finally came and wow... they were in miniature glasses.  Not so happy about the size.  When you order a martini... it should be in a standard martini glass.  They were tasty though, so we ordered a sandwich and a margarita pizza.  Meanwhile, a table of 4 sat down about 5 minutes after us.  Later when the server finally came with their wine bottle and 4 glasses they had already left.  The table next to us told the waitress \""I guess they got tired of waiting\"". \n\nAll in all, the food was average, pleasant decor, however, the service needs work.  I look forward to giving Hanny's another shot but will wait a couple of months."
0,"Went to the re-opening night after hearing it was all day happy hour and was craving fresh pitas and hummus.  Me and two friends waited 15 minutes for water and there was no sign of the waiter even though the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived.  They then proceeded to bring us hummus that tasted sour and after another 20 minutes we received new hummus because the waiter claimed that too much lemon was in the first hummus they served us.  We didn't get a chance to put in our order until about another 20 minutes (so we have been seated for more than 40 minutes at this point).  When our food finally came out, specific order preferences had been overlooked, I nearly spit out my soggy calamari and the bruschetta was mostly just a giant piece of bread with old tomatoes.  After an hour of waiting, we didn't really expect to be happy with the meal but this was a bit much!  Drink orders finally arrived and we no longer even wanted them.  The manager came over and was very understanding of our issues but it didn't compensate for an already ruined night.  She explained that the waiter was new and his section was the biggest.  For an order that consisted of 5 appetizers and 2 drinks, we were in the restaurant for over an hour and a half.  Wouldn't recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick and relaxing meal."
1,"The Venetian's standard luxury rooms kick ass compared to some of the other hotels on the strip. We opted to stay in one of their king sized bed luxury room with a view of the strip. The room is large (650sf) and spaced out nicely with a sunken living room that boast an L shaped sofa, large work desk, dining table, 32 lcd tv, coffee table and ottoman. \n\nThe king sized bed was the perfect combination of soft and firmness with lots of pillows. The only issue i had with the bed that it wasn't your typical king sized bed. The width was correct but the length of the bed was short and my toes touched the end of the bed and i know im not a tall person. There is also a 32'' lcd tv for the bedroom as well.\n\nThe bathroom has a separate enclosed shower and roman tub with a double sink and a small lcd tv. The toilet is enclosed in a tiny room which was a bit odd. The shades and curtain completely blackout the sun and can be remotely controlled. \n\nI would suggest staying in one of the upper floors if you want to sleep in since they have pool parties and can be heard from our 28th floor room. Checking in was easy and quick. If you plan to valet your car, do it at the entrance valet area and not the back one. We valet our car in the back area and had to walk all the way to the front to check in and walk all the way back to reach the 3 elevators for the tower. The staff was courteous at all times and used our last name when being greeted. Oh, room service was great as well. They delivered our hot breakfast, set up the table with linens, water, utensils, newspaper and a little thank you card."
1,"Great food, but very slow service. It always takes forever to get food on the table. The place is always super busy, which I suppose is good, but don't expect to get seated too quickly. The food is delicious and I would recommend the pancakes and anything with chorizo! The hash browns are also very tasty. Nice place if you're into brunch food."
1,"If only we can live (eat) like this every day.  \n\nWe came to Michael Mina Las Vegas for a dear friend's birthday celebration.  While I've never been to a Michael Mina restaurant, I've know of his reputation as a top chef for many years.  \nThe dinner did not disappoint.  \n\nWe had the pre-theatre pre-fix dinner priced at $65/person w/out wine.  The food was elegant and delicious.  While the portions were controlled, after the three course I found myself very satisfied (but not stuffed).\n\nI started with the Maine lobster tortellini and it was good.\nFollowed up with the Filet of Beef - (cooked perfectly) with Roasted fingerling potato, morbier cheese, sylvetta.\nTop that off with his root beer float with Warm Chocolate chip and nut cookies...  mmmm\n\nThe best dish of the night for me was my wife's order of Phyllo Crusted Sole wtih Crab Brandade, Horseradish-Mascarpone, Sauce Dijon....  really perfectly cooked piece of fish (fried).  Mascarpone on top to give it the creaminess and the Dijon and Horseradish give it the bite to cut through the richness....  totally awesome.\n\nThey charged our party a $50/bottle corkage fee and a limit of two bottle.  VERY EXCESSIVE IN MY OPINON.  if not for this penalty, I'd give Michael Mina a five star rating."
0,"Went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  I kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down Mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  Vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....Right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  It's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  I ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a Mexican pizza.  Food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  Pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  Margarita was weak also.  I usually get a little buzz going on when I order a large one, but I didn't get anything from that one.  As always the food at Macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....I think it's time to try something else even if I'm in the neighborhood."
0,"i had thought this was going to be great really!!  had this on my TO DO list 4ever.  Finally went, on a monday. Menu indicates \""MONDAY MADNESS 1/2 glasses of wine\"". (see rvws below - monDAY - not for an hour or so). so i ended up ordering 3 glasses of wine - bill: all full price!! Was told only after 3:30. is it just me? A Happy Hr is usually 4-6 (or there-about) but monDAY is \""DAY\"", as in during the DAY.  not a happy hr (or 2) special.  (rudely told: the web indicates this - {I never looked}, the inside blackboard says - {i was OUTside!} & inside the bill  folder- {umm, it was under a survey & AFTER my bill arrived???})\n\nFLATbread was THICK, like reg. pizza, & had 1/2 cup of canned parm. cheese all over = can u say: dry, boring, mundane?\n\nbread STICKS were huge, thick, doughy things  - my kids make ones from pillsbery dough which tasted same.  These were size of croissants, certainly not sticks - never seen any breadsticks that remotely resemble these in my life.  Should be called Pilsbery Dough Plate Special - i swear that's exactly what it was.\n\nI seriously hate to provide a review like this, not to mention a confrontation which ensued when my bill arrived, but it was awful.  I could write many more upsetting details which occurred, but i won't - it would be petty.  Suffice to say I couldn't seriously think on going back.\n(i should  point out that eventually i did recieve the 3 glasses at 1/2 off, but the bill did not reflect any break on the 'flatbread' not 'breadsticks')"
1,"I live here. I have visited every single BooFay you can imagine. Even the bad ones. This place is like sitting in a nightclub with bomb food. (no joke the music is great) And Endless great food. I don't think the bad reviewers have an experience of a proper range to determine what can be amazing food or not. The service was on target. They took the plates away immediately. No wait to get drinks filled up. ...So, the food..I can't say enough good things about all of it. ... All seafood was fresh. And amazing. If you don't know the difference. Don't bother. Especially the huge shrimp. Pizza, Salad, bread, sweet potato fries, au gratin potatos, pasta, asain food, all of it. A foodie would approve. And I swear it was Carlos Santana sitting next to us. Dude, if you like variety and good food and fun club music. Try this. You will have a super fun time. LOL !!"
1,"I will give the Summit Diner a 4 star. I really think 3 1/2 would be more appropriate. \nIt was the first time we visited the place and since its like 6 minutes from where we live it was time to try it for breakfast. \nGood reception, friendly. The interior is busy. Way too busy, too many signs and different nooks.2 tv's on sport channels.  Maybe it's more suitable for night dining but in the morning it makes you somewhat hyper. But all customers were almost same age (60's)\nThe menu seems to be extensive and I do not know if that is a good thing. \nWe decided to go with a simple and comfortable eggs and meat breakfast. We thought if that was good it would be a start. Believe me there are places who cannot deliver decent eggs and bacon. \nCoffee: very weak. No special coffees to get. Just what they have on tap. We are used to Nespresso, so even before we leave the house for breakfast we have a good coffee. \nTwo scrambled eggs (looked more than 2 eggs)with bacon (plenty) and a lot of pretty good hash browns, no toast. \nTwo eggs over easy with 3 sausage links and hash browns, toast. \nIt was honest fare. Nothing special but well served and the waitress and waiter came to check on us a few times. \nWhy 4 stars: location is convenient, food was ok. Service was good. People are nice."
1,"My family & I have a wonderful time staying at Red Lion Inn & Suites on 08/27/13.  Check in was so fast & friendly. The Clerk was very nice & helpful. He told me I have an automatic upgrade to a full suite with kitchen. He shows me actually where my room is on the map, which is 25 steps away. I park my car right under my room. I can see my car from my room. The staff are very friendly. Breakfast in the morning is ok. The most fancy thing my niece & nephew love is the pancake. Everything else is just regular continental breakfast.\n\nThe room was very clean, beds are clean & pillows very comfortable.  The kitchen is very clean & the fridge is huge.  It is very nice to have the kitchen we went to Fry supermarket & brought corns to cook & green grapes to washed in the sink.  The pool was small & kinna dirty. The room is quiet.  We will return to Red Lion Inn & Suites if we return to the area."
0,"It's the day before NYE 2011 and I'm here with my family visiting from Hawaii for an end of the year night out.  It's not the first time we've been here as the food here is quite good and is quite evident by the fact that there is a half hour line waiting to be seated.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food on the appetizer menu is quite tasty and their sushi is average, the service tonight was below average.  Our server was busy and as attentive as she could be, but the issues were rather with the items on the menu which were out of stock / not available.  While she informed us of both the hamachi kama and salmon kama being out, she failed to let us know that the uni (quite possibly one of the best items on the menu) was also unavailable as their vendor didn't have any in stock to deliver.  We found out about the lack of uni when she came by to ask what we would like for dessert as all of us were anticipating another plate of sushi to be delivered to the table.\n\nNow let me explain...  I could have totally understood this if there was some mention made of this before or while we were putting in our initial order.  I could have even been okay with this (although disappointed) if this was mentioned in the middle of dinner.  Instead, my family waited in anticipation for a plate of uni nigiri and was instead greeted with the information at the near end of our meal.  Uni itself is sea urchin and is definitely not for everyone.  No matter where you order it, you will either love or hate it.  For some I think it's a consistency issue.  In the case of my family, we love it!  We have actually walked out of other sushi bars here in Las Vegas because they didn't have any.  Las Vegas has many sushi bars and almost limitless choices of great food.  \n\nOver the past few years, we have actually followed the owner of this establishment from other places he has co-owned or worked at as the food has always been good.  Tonight when my father approached him about the lack of uni, he seemed dismissive and quite unapologetic to the point where my father was going to leave an 8 cent tip on the check to get his message across that perhaps in this economy that service and humility toward your customer can only get you ahead while the adverse will get you the opposite.  I left an additional $20 with the check (and my father's 8 cents).\n\nThe sushi here is okay.  I actually drive a cab and have been recommending this establishment whenever I'm asked in person or on the dispatch radio about a sushi bar.  The items on the appetizer list are awesome and I definitely recommend the Garlic Chicken and Tako Karaage.  Tonight was just an unfortunate experience and I definitely feel that the situation could have been handled differently.\n\nI'll be back again in the new year and hope that things are better."
1,"I stayed here years ago, when the hotel was new. The main hotel floor in the pyramid was under reconstruction (rumor had it that the foundation was sinking) and the noise of the jackhammers got so noisy that we felt compelled to complain to the front desk to see what could be done. We got moved to one of the newly completed towers and were given a discount for our next stay. That was good enough to get me back. \nOur next trip was peaceful. I fell in love with the 3 swimming pools and could only be dragged away to eat at their fantastic buffet or to gamble a little (enough to try and win my money for the buffet). \nMy mom and brother were blown away by the inclinators (elevators that go up at the same angle of the pyramid). We also love the Egyptian decor and the gigantic statues in the entrance. \nScared of heights, both stays in the pyramid, I was scared to death by the hallway to our room, considering the rail is only about 3 feet high and overlooks the casino floor, (in our case, 20 floors down). Not that it deterred me. I just made my way to my room, inching along the walls. I probably looked crazy, but most people in Vegas end up doing something crazy, hence the phrase \""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. \nThe hotel has a video arcade and IMAX theater, for people who don't gamble or bring their kids along with them to Vegas. I found myself in the IMAX one evening, too hungover to go out. We watched a documentary on Mt. Everest. Man! That \""Hike\"" would be even scarier than our hotel hallways! ha ha \nWhen I was here last Club\"" LAX\"" was called \""Ra!\"" It's huge and their dj's play the most current music. They have a dress code, so gents - don't wear sneakers. I was in love with the cool cobra faucets in the bathroom. \nThe location of the hotel is pretty good. You have the Mandalay Bay next door, which houses concerts and boxing matches as well as a the monorail. It goes from the Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur (passing the Luxor). You then cross the overpass to the MGM and it'll take you all the way to the other end of the strip, to the Sahara). \nAll in all, I would totally stay here again. Not just for nostalgic reasons, but because of its uniqueness."
0,"Didn't like that they waited till fifteen minutes before my appointment to call and tell me insurance had not approved. I was almost in the parking lot. They blamed my doctor so I called him. They had not sent the paperwork until one day earlier.  A week later, surprise, paperwork was fine and I got the M R I on my knee. Now I have to wait two weeks for the next appointment my knee doc had available."
1,"I was fortunate to have business meetings at the Wynn this past week and made it a point to have lunch at La Cave as I had heard great things. And I was definitely impressed. La Cave, known for their small plates, flatbreads and extensive wine list, was simply amazing! I dined with 2 colleagues and ordered 5 plates, which was more than enough to share. I will review in the order we received our food, starting with the mushroom grits which were to die for! I don't believe I had ever had grits before and my first experience eating them was amazing. The grits are served with the mushrooms, pecorino cheese and butter on top and after mixing everything in, each bite I took was absolutely delicious. Next up was the salt-roasted beets, topped with goat cheese and pistachios. Every beet salad I've had in the past is usually served cold, whereas the beets I enjoyed at La Cave were warm and fresh. Shortly thereafter came the bacon-wrapped dates which were also out of this world. Our chorizo & sausage flatbread came next which was a very generous serving. The flatbread was unlike any other with the unique toppings served here. Finally, we had ordered the stuffed chicken and that is the only dish I wouldn't highly recommend. While not bad, it was just chicken with no unique touches. All in all, I am so glad I was able to dine at La Cave and will definitely return upon my next trip to Vegas."
0,"I seriously have no idea why people eat here where there are 100 better alternatives for Mexican food in this town. We had a shredded chicken chimichanga, green corn tamale, and chicken enchilada. All 3 were bland and tasteless at best and all three were very greasy. If you think Taco Bell is great Mexican then this is your place, otherwise, steer clear, go home and pop open a can of processed tamales from Del Monte, you'll get a better meal."
0,"Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a \""Minced\"" barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.   \n\nFirst let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was \""okay\"" but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.  \n\nAs for the barbecue, it is also \""okay;\"" I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise."
1,"Bottom line:  If you need a wedding venue in Las Vegas - there are certainly no shortages of them.  However, I'll put in my vote for Caesars Palace.\n\nI'll start off by saying that originally I had absolutely no desire to get married in Vegas.  I had originally determined that Virginia would be the place for us - it's where we live, it's where we met; the hardest part - finding that special spot not only for the wedding, but for the wedding reception. When I couldn't find anything to my liking, I started thinking that perhaps Vegas wouldn't be so bad (it is after all where he proposed to me).  I had some friends turn me on to Caesars Palace.  Mr. Douglas G helped me set up everything I needed and also put me in contact with others to help me make it an experience I won't forget. \n\nGregg and I wanted simple, no fuss and intimate with family and friends.  Caesars had the perfect package - the Bella Luna. Our wedding coordinator, Lindsay was awesome!  She guided me through each step usually with just a form to film out or a question to answer (nice and simple the way I like it).  On the day of the wedding, she called me to make sure I had everything I needed and helped it all go smooth.  The photographer was very professional and took lots of photographs - I can't wait to see them all.   As a venue it was perfect, I could not have asked for anything better!  \n\nThanks again to Douglas and Lindsay, but also to Irene P for arranging our Friday night pre-wedding festivities, and Sandra B for arranging our wedding dinner.  Thank you all for making our wedding weekend no stress and perfect!"
0,"I've been to two of their locations and I have to say this one is so dirty and disgusting. The food was good. But at my visit there one of the employees was sitting at a table eating out of the metal bowls they use to toss the food in. When he was finished it looked like he just put it back on the counter to be used again!!! Really?!? It made me sick to my stomach!! I got the honey walnut shrimp which was good but left a weird film in my mouth and had a very strange sourish \""sauce\"" in the bottom of the to go box. I probably will not be returning to this location."
1,"I had an urge to get a mild caffeine buzz and check my email after waking up late today, so I went to Cafe Falco, recommended by my roomie.\n\nSurrounded by warehouses and loft spaces in typical Mile-End fashion, this place is well lit and the decor achieves a high level of feng-shui. Most people were ordering lunch, which seemed to be a sort of japanese infused cafe fare, I may give it a go next time. This time I just got a cafe latte and sat down at a long table where I was joined by a couple of lunchies who I overheard say something about \""c'est les petits delices dans la vie qui comptent\"" so they must have been liking it. The latte was good but didn't amaze me by its subtlety, and it was kind of expensive, but I had fun watching it being made in their crazy coffee contraptions."
0,"After traveling for many years to a variety of hotels and locations, I found that the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas is by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The customer service is one of a fly by night setup. After booking four suites and staying there for four days, it never changed, but got worse as each day progressed. At check in the special request for our rooms were not done. We spent over 30 minutes trying to figure out why things were not accurate after booking each room weeks in advance. The rooms as mentioned by another review were substandard, and I was not impressed at all. On our third day we got harassed by the valet parking workers, and were accused of not being hotel guest. After a major scene was caused and lies were made, my car was then vandalized by them. I had left my car with the valet for less than 5 hours. They completely scratched off my tags and license plate. Although management was apologetic, it is very obvious that there is a lack in training, communication, and over all excellency in work ethic. I would never stay there again!"
0,"My husband and I had dinner here tonight, expecting something...more.  I had the trout, and he ordered the steak.  They both were good but just not as good as we had expected it to be.  Or maybe we've just had better.  My biggest complaint about both dishes is that it was surprisingly very lemon-y.  At first, I thought that since I had ordered fish, it must have been topped off with lemon juice because even my mashed potatoes tasted sour.  But my husband's entree was lemon-y too.  It was very bizarre.  Anyway, if we are going to pay around $20/person for fish and steak, I think we'll go somewhere else that uses less lemons in their dishes."

0,"We came here with a party of 15 people for a birthday. It was a tuesday, so it was almost empty for this GIANT bar with a stage, and the performers were starting to get set up.\n\nI was ordering the food from a kind older waitress who was jottings things down on a napkin when I told her that my boyfriend and I were going to be on the same check. \n\n\""We don't do that here\"".\n\nOkay, thats fine. I'll assumed I could take my receipt and his, and just pay for both. I mean, there's no way they were going to lump 25 people on the same bill, right? I mean.. we had like 10 couples and a bunch of kids. I got the food, which was okay, said happy birthday, and wanted to head out after being there for an hour or two. \n\nI got my waitress, who seemed a bit over her head, and calmly asked for my bill so I could leave. She gave me a menu and said \""Figure it out for yourself\"". \n\nWhat. The. Hell. \n\nFigure it out for myself? What was the point of a register? Do I look like an accountant? What are City of Scottsdale taxes here, anyway? Are we on a barter system? Why do I even have to pay anything at this point, if it is some free-for-all where I tell you how much my food was and you maybe/maybe not charge me?! Seriously.\n\nI stood there, trying to talked to here, for 10 minutes and she just ignored me. Like in a bad movie, I was standing there, making eye contact, while another person who was supposed to be my server pretended I didn't even exist. Unbelievable. I was so furious, I almost lost it. I calculated it out, even though the cost of the drinks wasn't on the menu, and left. BAH!"
0,THis restaurant is terrible my family and I were seated after waiting 15 min and was never waited on. We sat at our table for over 30 minutes and no one came to take our drink order much less food. IT was like we were not even there. This place has terrible service. Stay away
1,"yo bay bay, whatchu want for dinner?\n\nhmmm, what's around these parts?\n\nI found a BBQ spot up the way, yelp reviews are stella.\n\nCool beans, less check it out.\n\nNice ambiance, a short wait on a Monday night, excellent BBQ, this place is the real deal yo!\n\nChicken, short ribs, beef ribs, shrimp, if you can grill it, they gots it!"
1,"This is a great spot for Korean food. This was my first time visiting and I would definitely visit again based on my experience. Food was very reasonably priced considering the size of the portions that were given. Be sure to check their daily specials!\n\nI don't understand all of the 3 star or less reviews. They seem to be just very picky people and maybe it wasn't up to their \""standards,\""  but before you go believing their nonsense, give this place a try. The food was delicious, got it within 10 minutes (remember that speed doesn't always equal satisfaction. They cook the food fresh per order; expect about a 10-15 minute wait) and the staff was very nice. Will come here again!"
1,"As the only upper end shopping center in Charlotte, SouthPark Mall garners 4 stars, since there is nothing else to compare it to, however, it is no different that any typical mall in a larger city with higher end retailers.  \n\nThe usual offerings that have now become so commonplace in subburban settings, such as Louis Vuitton, Nordstrom, Ralph Lauren, Aveda and the like are represented in this well kept shopping center, but if you are visiting from a larger city, you might find it to be on the smallish scale."
1,"Ate here while on vacation in Edinburgh and was too tired to go out. After seeing the other reviews we decided to get a few pizzas. The pizza was awesome! The toppings were tasty and the crust was freshly prepared. Had three different pizzas: one with mushrooms and pepperoni, one with chicken and pepperoni, and the last with all different types of meat and they were all fantastic. For all three pizzas it was only like 23\u00a3 and fed four fat Americans. I definitely would suggest it to anyone."
0,"This place has bad service, lazy waitresses and a negative staff! Do no come here for \""happy\"" hour!"
1,Really excellent food. Took our whole company there to celebrate a recent success and they loved it. I highly recommend the fried rice. Very tasty and not greasy. I like it because the food is very authentic yet simple and made with love. Waiter is awesome. He even played a Cambodian xylophone for us!
1,Awesome place. Sushi is fresh uni is also. Great service. Awesome sushi rows. Mussels are good also. The place is open till 2pm. Last all you can eat is at 130pm. Appetizers are good. I will recommend this place to anybody and it close to the strip to.
1,"Would definitely back for brunch! Portions are the perfect size - not so huge that you've just had three days worth of calories in one meal. The waffles are great - light and made fresh. \nGreat service - our server was fast, personable and friendly."
1,"I had a great experience here. In my trip to Vegas I loved being able to get a great breakfast at 1AM. Our server Jesse was very accommodating and on his job. The atmosphere in the Cosmopolitan was awesome, cool lighting design and the DJ was playing some smooth mixes. \n\nI had the The Henry breakfast with avocado, and sourdough bread. Hot coffee to balance out all my beer drinking. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in Las Vegas."
1,"I stopped into Capriotti's yesterday after reading dozens of enthusiastic reviews. I decided to get a 9\"" Bobbie with hot mustard and a 9\"" meatball with American cheese and fried onions to go. Ten minutes later, I was back out on the street with two handsomely wrapped sandwiches and an orange crush. \n\nNeedless to say, they did not disappoint! I personally preferred the Bobbie over the meatball--the turkey is extraordinarily well-prepared. The meatball was a contender, but I like a bit more garlic and zest in the sauce. Nonetheless, I'll order it again, especially considering its convenient location off the Strip. On a happy side note, Capriotti's stocks Herr's ketchup chips by the bag!"
0,"The only thing good about the meal was the onion rings.  The french fries where cold when they arrived and the dipping sauces were inedible.  Burger not cooked to desired \""medium well\"".  If burgers are what your do, there really should not be any question about when they are done.  With the number of people they serve in a day they should have a well oiled machine, and they didn't.  Disappointed to say the least"
0,I stayed at circus circus on april 13th - 14th. \nThere were roaches in the room. \nCasino staff was nice though.
1,"Got the create your own tacos for 7.25, soft flour, carne asada, asadero cheese, and pico de gallo salsa. For what seems like whole on wall (it'd be easy to miss this restaurant since it's not facing the street and it's next to coin laundry). The wait was worth it. Carne asada was very good. I agree with one of the reviewers, price for a lot of items on the menu is kind of on the high side. If you are in Madison, a must-go foodie place."
1,Big fan of the salads!  I wish they did not use so much plastic.  If you are eating in the restaurant they need a reusable dish.  Food is tasty!
1,"A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the idea of a pool hall and when I looked up the location, I realized this had some other name when we were in high school and has been around for a long time. \n\nThe whole Metro Center area has changed a lot over the years. Back in the 80's it was a great place to cruise (when we weren't on Central Avenue), but I digress. I borrowed mom's car, drove from Sun City and arrived close to the start time of the get together. I have been friends with Kari since we were 15 and by coming to town for her birthday weekend, was able to see some women I hadn't seen since we finished high school(back in 1989, yeah I know....)\n\nI had very low expectations and I was glad. The place is pretty run down but super low key. Had I been there for other reasons, I would have entered into one of their nightly poker tournaments, but I was there for other reasons. There was a small group of people for this shindig-around 15 at one point but really about 10 for the long haul. No one ended up playing pool, but there were tons of tables, along with darts and some video games. They had a great jukebox and we had a blast playing all sorts of music from several different decades. They offer food (no one ordered any), a full bar and lots of specials on beer. The cocktail waitresses were very nice but that could be because I tip very well, but it was fun. \n \nThis place could use a really good cleaning as I left smelling like something stale/moldy. Not such a good thing when only in town for the weekend with limited clothing. Thank you Febreeze!"
1,"I will admit, I had low expectations of this place. Monster mini golf owns another location in Bakersfield, that I wasn't impressed with. Yet, this place is AMAZING. \n\nMy friend and I, had a 2 for 1 coupon, and had the locals discount. 10.00 for both of us to mini golf. You walk into a flourescent room, and your glowing. Off to the side is a gift shop. Yet, unlike most places in Vegas, the gift shop is pretty neat. \n\nTheres a DJ, who takes requests for your favorite KISS song, and a gentleman, who challenges you to get a hole in one for a prize. It's a fun, lively atmosphere. Whether or not, your a kiss fan. You will have an enjoyable experience. \n\nThey even make the experience of using the restroom unique, provided in the restroom are sharpies, in which they encourage you to write messages on the wall to KISS. \n\nFun, Inexpensive, and DEFINATLY worth going to."
0,"Total dump!\n\nRecently stayed at the Flamingo for a work function. Horrible experience. Don't let the pics on the website fool you-only some of the rooms have been renovated. Mine had a running sink, lumpy carpet and the smell of smoke made my nose run the entire time I was there. On top of all that you have to pay to use the gym and the internet and there is no breakfast provided (which to be fair, I've heard are all to be expected for Vegas where you pay for everything.) Outside is nice but inside is totally depressing. The other hotels have a much better atmosphere. The Flamingo seemed to be filled with a much older and sadder client base. The worst part was the woman in her wedding gown sitting at the slot machine. Ugh. Want to enjoy your trip to Vegas? Avoid this place."
0,"Ok, the food here is pretty good. But how good can something be if you wait half an hour for it? That's after a twenty minute wait to get a table. \nHere's the real gripe I have about this place. They screwed up our order and brought out the wrong thing. Sounds like an easy fix right? Wrong. It took another 25 minutes to get our correct order. It takes two minutes to make pancakes. Why it takes The Orange Table 25 minutes is beyond me. \nThe worst part of all was that they were trying to rush us out of their place. \""Hey, do you want those pancakes to go?\"" No you idiot, my son was hungry 25 minutes ago when you brought out the wrong order, I think we'll eat them here. Get my order right, fix problems in a timely fashion and I'll leave your overpriced restaurant more quickly.\nThis is a perfect example of a restaurant that has become too popular for its own good. Their staff is rude, their kitchen is slow and their pancakes are overpriced."
0,"If you wish to be completely ignored, this is the place for you. \n\nLeft due to complete lack of service while others that came in after were served.\n \nChecked Trip Advisor as well. The lack of service and dismissive staff are definitely a consistent issue here. \n\nGo anyplace other than this. \n\nChef Keller I expected better than this. \n\nPerhaps Chef Colicchio can stop by and offer your staff some training. We experienced top notch service at Craftsteak."
1,"perfect place for coke addicts! theres soo many coke products, its craazy. t-shirts made from recycled plastic coke bottles?? \n\ni was kinda disappointed cause its pretty small compared to M&M's 4 or 5 levels. the products are a little pricey, but they are one of a kind and you cant really find that stuff anywhere else. there are a lot of great gift ideas. the top level has an old school snack bar with milkshakes, old fashioned glass cokes, etc.\n\nyou'll have a pretty fun time checking all the stuff out. hit this up!"
1,"I can honestly say that this is the best pizza joint i've been to in Las Vegas,better than Sammy's any day. I only wish they had the bbq chicken pizza like Sammy's has. I am at Grimaldis once or twice a month. If you haven't been, GO!"
1,Best buffet . It's expensive but it's worth it.
0,"About as bad as it gets. I have two service contracts that contracted with sears, both times the service tech went to the wrong address and refused to call to verify address.  After almost an hour on hold, sears off shore rep could only schedule a repair almost a week later.  Sears is terrible, stay away."
1,"Smoky but surprisingly not divey -- I like to think of it as the poor, well-scrubbed step-sister of Silky's. (Just roll with me.)\n\nThe drinks are cheap and strong, and the locals are friendly. It's the kind of place where families go, along with Bachelorette Party girls, along with Greenfield bro-types, along with retired millworkers. Lots of Nice Drunks who give freely the handshakes and the \""Eyyyyyy!\""\n\nTheir karaoke night, every other Saturday, is a bunch of fun due to the melting-pot nature of the clientele, where Right Said Fred rubs up against 50s boogie-woogie. The only downside to karaoke night is that the kitchen closes early because of it."
1,"Man, we had such a fantastic time here last night!  The Boilermaker Jazz Band was playing, filling the hall with cool 1940's style swing and jazz.  I was actually glad to wait for a table, so the hubby and I could enjoy the show.  The beers were good, and I especially recommend the Marzen and Bock.  Seating is family style, so you'll likely be seated next to strangers if the place is busy.  We like meeting new people, so talking it up with our table-mates and listening to the band made it feel like a party.  A party with 5 different types of wusrt, that is!  I highly recommend starting with the K\u00c4SE kugel mit speck, which is basically German mac and cheese. Topped with bacon.  Oh yeah.\n\nI'm looking forward to their Mardi Gras celebration!"
0,"A year ago this was my favorite buffet in Vegas.  Perhaps I had just tried a few better places since that visit, but I felt very disappointed in the offerings this year. There were no hot crab legs, most of the mussels were closed and inedible, and the macarons were dry and stale tasting. I couldn't find much that I wanted to eat- even the cheese selection was lacking. I sipped on some onion soup and ate a cold baguette and left disappointed. Hopefully it was just an off night, but I won't be back to find out."
0,"I have grown up with Britney and remained a loyal fan through the best and worst of Britney times.  I'll never forget opening her first album in the car (I couldn't wait to get all the way home) and listening to it day and night over and over.  I recorded the Toxic video on my DVR and watched it every morning while getting ready for school.  I was pretty upset when we had to replace that DVR.  A few years later, I discovered YouTube...woohoo...unlimited Toxic!    \n\nWith all of this being said, I was extremely underwhelmed with the show.  It nothing to do with her lip syncing. I did not expect her to sing live.  Puh-lease...   \n\nHer dancers earn her one extra star making it two stars.They were absolutely AMAZING.  Her dancing was half-ass.  Maybe age had something to do with it.  We can all admit, 30 is NOT the new 20 when it comes to dancing.  I caught myself just standing there half heartedly singing the songs.  I would have to make myself dance to try to develop the vibe.\n\nThe theater was nice; I really liked the layout.  Merch was ridiculously expensive, even more than normal."
1,I have been going coming here for over two years. The service is amazing! I feel very comfotable here. The staff always does a great job and the salon is very clean. I Love that they offer your a drink and the prices are not overly inflated. I wish they had more locations because it can be tough to make it to that side of town regularly for me.
1,"Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo"
1,Omg the chocolate black Forrest cake is like changing and highly recommend it!!
1,"If I could do 4.5 stars I would. This is some of the best food I've ever had. My failure to give 5 stars was for service, but I'll get to that later.\n\nFood: We had the special terrine, which was delicious. The bread is to be expected: great fresh baguette slices. I had the house beer, unimpressive, but that's not why I was there. I was there for the \""DUCK IN A CAN.\"" It was all I hoped it would be, and I am still feeling the bloat after 2 days. No need to describe it here: look it up. It's delicious, and amazing. Some reviewers think it's overpriced or gimicky. No way. It's a marvel. Girlfriend had the duck breast: perfectly cooked, and a heaping portion.\n\nThe missing star here resulted from our server. The rest of the staff (whom we interacted with about 50% of the time) was worthy of 5 stars. Our primary server, however, was an impatient d-bag. I hope they pool tips because I tipped well, but if I could have tipped this guy less than the obligatory American 20% I would have. With the money paid, and the effort put in to get a reservation in advance, just smile and pat my fuzzy head when I ask you a question, even if it's a silly question. Don't scoff and then try to run away. There was a server name printed on the receipt, but that might be the server who actually ran my credit card (he was nice) so no need to out anyone by name.\n\nAnyway, delightful place, mind-blowing food, nice decor, good music playing, friendly waitstaff, and one server that was dick and reduced the enjoyment of a duck in a can very slightly (but not that much because it was awesome!)."
0,"Barmasa was a little bit of a letdown after my boyfriend kept telling me how good the one in NYC is. He's also a bit of a sushi snob. \n\nAnyway, we had 7:30pm reservations, which we figured would be enough time to eat light and head to the Rio for Penn & Teller at 9. Little did we know that it would take 30 minutes from the time we placed our order, to the time we received our first dish (Kobe Garlic Soy Steak), then another 30 minutes before we received our Sashimi Tasting and plate of 6 Nigiri sushi pieces. Everyone around us, who got seated and ordered after us, got their sushi before us and much faster. Service, nonetheless, could have been MUCH better. Granted the place just opened 10 days ago, for the price we were paying for the food, we expected better than average service. This was unacceptable. \n\nThe food, on the other hand, was high-quality sashimi/sushi. Sure, the pieces were small, but there are not many places you can get the selection of fish they have outside of Tsukiji fish market in Japan. The prices are what they are because of the environment you're in and the quality of the food. Don't go in expecting the same mediocre rolls you see at the corner Japanese Sushi bar run by non-Japanese. The other commenters below (except for Jen L.) had ridiculous expectations. This is a high-end restaurant in a high-end hotel. If you're going to try Barmasa (or Shaboo for that matter), expect a significant price tag and a menu of different kinds of high-quality fish (and meats -- kobe and wagyu) that you won't normally see. \n\nAll-in-all, I hope that the service becomes more polished fast. The food alone would have warranted a 4-5 stars from me, but the fact that the waitress didn't know what she was talking about and our orders took considerably longer than it should have keeps me from rating Barmasa greater than a 2. I'll stick to the one in New York City."
1,"located in treasure island - a great place for dinner before the 7pm mystere show because they open at 4:30pm.  started off with a pitcher of margaritas.. done right!  the guacamole was fresh and tasty.   all of us had the fajitas (2 veggie and 2 chicken) and loved them!  i had the vegetarian fajitas - bell peppers, onions, and other veggies.  got them \""alambre style\"", which is topped with melted cojita cheese.. so good and worth it!   the best thing, by far, was the kahlua creme brulee!  don't pass it up!  all in all, a good dinner and conveniently located a few steps away from the mystere theatre!"
1,Great pizza - Great service - Quiet romantic atmosphere where you can talk.
1,"I love the ambience and attitude in this place. The chicken wings are a little on the small side, but great flavors to choose from. Definitely going to continue watching sports in here from time to time. The service is decent and the prices are pretty fair."
1,"SOOO GOOD!!  I loved it!!  Juicy, flavorful burger!! I would eat there all the time if I\n could. Next time I will split a burger with the fiance so we can try the chocolate burger! !"
1,"Cooperstown Sports Grill Does NOT disappoint! \n\nCooperstown offers an incredible selection of beers, good food and excellent service.  The prices are reasonable, and the servers are outstanding.  \n\nCooperstown Sports Grill is big, filled with large screens televisions. The walls are covered in vintage guitars signed by every rock star and rare sports collectibles signed by past & present icons.\n\n The food entrees have celebrity names, like the Bill O'reilly BBQ sandwiches, Kurt Warner corned beef,  AZ Cardinals Country BBQ chicken salad, or my favorite the \""Jeff\""  grilled chicken salad.  I would put the grilled chicken salad up against anybody (including Durant's or even Arrogant Butcher).\n\nSo if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix give Cooperstown Sports Grill a try, it does not disappoint"
0,If their was negative stars they'd get them! Been to many different del tacos here in phoenix. So far been to this specific location about 3 times and gotten horrible service! Also All 3 times my order has been wrong and taste like I get the leftovers ! Never fails.
0,"There is absolutely nothing that separates this place from hundreds of other AYCE sushi joints across the valley, aside from maybe convenience. We came on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy. It is very apparent that the staff does not know how to handle busy peaks. We had three semi clueless people servicing our table. It was very bizarre. \n\nWe ordered three rolls, an order of nigiri, and green mussels. One of the three servers brings out the \""Mussels\"".I point out that we ordered mussels and he informs that's what was in front of us.  I politely inform him that in fact I have seen a mussel or two in my day, and this was some type of a leaf tempura, not mussels. He looks confused, then he rushes off and comes back to inform us that it's really a complimentary chef's creation, and our mussels were going to be out shortly. Wow. I mean how could you even confuse the two? \n\nThe fish was not fresh and the creations were pretty much all the same thing. The service was extremely lackluster and a toddler slipped and fell as the family was leaving. They promptly grabbed the \""wet floor\"" sign and put it up. They did check if the tot was okay, but then rushed to cover their butt. I mean, when the kid slipped it was apparent there was spilled water on the ground. Someone could have seriously injured themselves, or as a pregnant woman I shudder to think what could have happened. \n\nNothing about this experience warrants going back."
1,Wow. What a delight. Fantastic food and amazing service. We had our two energetic little boys with us and the staff treated them like they were their own. We'll definitely be back!
1,Great place awesome pizza and great beer oh and the red velvet pizookie is out of this world and speedy friendly service
1,"This is NOT your average good restaurant...it's GREAT! Try the fillet,or pork chop, if you are not in the mood for pizza or pasta. Fillet is THE BEST!...service is excellent, in a relaxed atmosphere. Go for happy hour and meet friendly bartenders, happy hour taste treats and drinks.  We live close by and have a difficult time keeping away from this place."
1,"I'm not exactly how I started going to Sweet Daddy Cupcakes, but I haven't looked back since first stepping foot into their shop. Their cupcakes are absolutely phenomenal! To me, it's all about the frosting -- and I could literally eat a tub of their frosting... it's not the thick, butter-based frosting that makes you feel like you're churning butter in your mouth; it's creamy and finger-licking good. Then the cupcakes themselves are so moist, and flavorful. The cupcake flavors are well thought out and they always rotate different flavors so you are able to try something new when you stop in. Hands down, Sweet Daddy's definitely has the best cupcakes in town, from their cupcake flavors, to the frosting and glitter on top. I literally drive 30-45 minutes to get a Sweet Daddy cupcake (or a dozen) anytime I need a sugar fix. So worth it!"
0,"Don't waste you're money on bottle service at Tao in a VIP section. I've seen better quality booth seating at a Denny's. $3000 to basically wait on line like everybody else. Our \""roped off area\"" a complete joke. Tao allowed ugly fat wanna be's to hang out in our area, drink our booze and then 30 minutes after we were seated they split our section in half and sat another group. Horrible vibe from the rude staff!!! If you're going to go, just pay the regular cover, buy a drink or two, then mooch off of the classy people in their lame VIP sections."
0,"We had the absolute experience here.\n\nSo when we arrived, it was around 2 and we checked in to put our name down on the waiting list. We were told that it would take around 45 minutes which is kind of crazy for a couple of burger but we walked across the street to Vons (there is nothing to do around the neighborhood). After 40 minutes we went back and saw that there was still 13 groups ahead of us. UM WHAT IN THE WORLD. I hope you seat those people in 5 minutes.\n\nNOPE. We waited another 45 minutes until we were called. An HOUR AND A HALF for burgers? WHAT WERE WE THINKING. So already in a bad mood, we were seated. They took our drink orders and food orders (we took a look at the menu while we were waiting).\n\nNow here's the best part. WE WAITED ANOTHER 30 MINUTES FOR THE FOOD TO COME. NOT EVEN THE FRIES CAME. SIMPLE FRIES THAT SHOULD TAKE MAX 10 MINUTES TO MAKE. So when we got the food we were terribly grumpy and unhappy with the service. \n\nThe burgers were not as good as I expected and not as good as waiting total 2 hours for it. Yes, it was better quality than let's say in and out but not terrific.\n\nSo overall, I was not angry because of the hour and a half I waited to be seated because it's not their fault that they are popular and in high demand. What is ridiculous is the fact that even after they seated us their service was like a snail's."
0,"I sometimes wonder if I should bring a bloodhound with me to the store so that I can have it find an employee. Then again, when I do find the employee they take me to the empty shelf. Except for one cashier, they seem unable to converse in English in even the simplest and rudimentary fashions (like Thank You or Good Day). Recently they moved things around in some parts of the store, so now you have to hunt for what used to be familiar. Pulled out the Harvey's and replaced it with Subway, so now you can have a bread sandwich after you finish your hunt for products.\n\nBought a bicycle rack here that wasn't made to actually hold a bicycle. Their own brand (Husky). I don't know which is sadder, the fact that the metal for the bicycle rack is completely contorted, or the fact that the wood rail has the edges lifted off. The bicycle rack that I do want is listed on their website as \""not in stock\"". Big shocker. Seriously, how hard is it to track the SKUs that you sell by computer? Isn't that the point of an inventory system? Maybe I would save time by driving the extra 4km to the competitors store instead of stopping here in hopes of finding products on the shelves!\n\nOnly good change, you can now get your receipt in email. It's a miracle! Now, if I could only find things to buy in the store instead of empty shelves and excuses."
1,The girls at Splendid are the best and very professional. The experience was totally pain free in a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Would recommend them without hesitation.
1,I got a good review from a friend about this place and decided to try the place. Loved it. The service was awesome and hardly any wait time on the food. We just got there just in time before the evening crowd. We ordered the snow crab trifecta seasoning. The seasoning was so good. My husband ordered a dozen oysters both half grilled and on the half shell. The oysters were small but ok. My little guy ordered the angry edamame and the edamame were kinda small. The trifecta seasoning was the best and were craving it again. It's pricy but the customer service we got and the food we will be back.
1,"Based on the multitude of reviews, I decided to give Rob and I Clean Carpets a shot. The first thing I liked was the placement of the corner guards to protect my furniture and walls. Second was his thorough explanations of his processes. \n\nIt definitely shows he knows what he is doing because he literally undid the lousy job that Stanley Steemer did. The high traffic area looks better than new. He literally extracted the dirt and excess soap used to clean my carpet previously.  When I looked at the buckets, I was floored to see 4 buckets full of dirty water and grime.  Words could not express how much more crud had been pulled up from the carpet.  My area rug looks better than new. He is more thorough than all the companies I used in the past combined. He even raked the carpet thoroughly to restore nap and speed drying.  \n\nHe even cleaned the carpet in my car to better than new.  The driver's footwell was extremely dirty over the time I owned my car.  When he got to it, I saw all the dirt from various parking lots, etc. disappear into the catch bucket.  Again, the water was extremely dirty from whatever they used in the past.\n\nWhen I saw the final results of the initial cleaning, I was floored with the grime and gunk that Rob got up versus the others. My wife was even more impressed.  This carpet cleaning was equal to Eco Fresh but not as expensive.  \n\nBut the main thing is customer service. He calls to make sure he is going to the right location. He also wants to make sure you will call him back when the time comes. \n\nGuaranteed I will do just that, Rob."
1,"I am a frequent customer of this place.  My favorite dish is one of the free complementary dishes; chapchae or however you spell it.  The tofu bowl size is a bit small bit but still fills me up.\n\nThe spicy BBQ chicken is my other favorite, a bit sweet but so good..\n\nThe price tag is about $10+ per person, or you can order a lunch combo and share with a friend for $14.\n\nThe service can be good, depends on who your waitress or waiter is.\nOverall, I give it two thumbs up."
0,"RUN FAR FAR AWAY! TERRIBLE!  If I could give negative stars, I would. I ordered a pizza, the BOY answers the phone in a hurry, didn't ask how I was going to pay, didn't take my credit card info, didn't verify my phone number, told me it would be 15-20 minutes, I asked if he needed further directions for the driver b/c its in an apt- he said no, AND told me it would be $15.90-something. The delivery driver ended up getting lost b/c the guy had the wrong address, 42 minutes later the driver arrives after I gave him directions, he expected cash which I did not have. I wanted to pay with my card. The driver left the pizza with me and goes back to the store. The \""manager\"" calls and wants payment; I have no problem with that, BUT when I told him what all happened, he TOTALLY froze stuttered his words and was completely USELESS! Its absolutely pathetic that this KID is a manager. Its like Fisher Price opened a pizza shop and hired him. He has NO idea how to talk to someone.  OH! and he gave me the wrong # to corporate... coincidence? --- and my pizza was cold. ugh. \nHarold, the delivery guy, was super awesome guy. He owned up to the mistake, apologized, offered excellent customer service even though it wasn't his mistake. Nice job Harold! \nNow waiting on a call back from corporate and the district manager. \nDear Donavan, Your management skills, or lack they're of, are some of the worst I've ever experienced. I would almost rather pay your college tuition than for you to ever handle an adult situation again. Don't ever EVER lie to a customer. You will always get caught... sorry had to call your corporate on ya. Shouldn't have done that, sir. CHEERS."
1,"I can only comment on my experience with Bottle Service but for me, that is important.  When people go to a nightclub and order Bottle Service for only two people and pay upwards of $1,000+, the expectations are going to be high.  \n\nThat said, this nightclub never disappoints in that regard.  They are unique in that they have a two-person table area so you don't get surrounded by the 4-6 guys who are all splitting a bottle and trying to get trashed while scoring women who want free drinks.  There is one table in particular that is directly at the edge of the dance area and also is outside by the waterfall.  It's hard to get but it is worth it because you get the best of both worlds:  the beat and vibe of the club and the cooling effect of being outside.  The only other place that has that feel is Hyde at the Bellagio but the fountains there can drench you if it's windy when the window is open.  \n\nThe last time we went, my fiance' and I were treated well by the servers and we also did what we usually do which is request a security guy be assigned near us to keep the bottle rats and club trash from putting their drinks on our table and hovering around.  We usually tip the security guy $100 right away and then it's basically like having a bodyguard there all night.  I remember one particular point during the night where one guy was just standing there and not moving plus bothering my fiance' while I was away from the table and the security guy grabbed him and basically picked him up and moved him away and said \""don't come back here, ever.\""  That was classic.\n\nI would recommend going here if you are a couple and you want the full experience without some of the downsides of going to clubs and ordering bottle service."
0,"We have eaten here many times over the years both at the original 40th St and Bell location and this newer location at 40th and Thunderbird location.  Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious, plus the service was always attentive.  My only issue with it was I considered to be a rather pricy restaurant.\n\nThe last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing.  I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what, but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy.  The prices are still as high as before.  The service we had the other night was abominable.   The server, Jenn, was one of the worst servers we have experienced in a long time.  There were two occupied tables when we arrived (and two other servers) and we had to wait for over ten minutes to be acknowledged and for our drink order to be taken.  The specials she told us were not the same as another server was telling his table.  The meal went downhill after that.  We had to ask and re-ask for just about everything.  The one bright spot was the bus girl who was so attentive.  Jenn kept telling us how busy she was (at her busiest she had three tables) yet she had plenty of time to talk at length to a table about what was happening on the TV show \""Big Brother\"".  It even took forever to get the check, which was finally handled by another server.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing, expensive meal that was ruined even further by a terrible server."
1,"this is typically our hotel of choice since we get our rooms comped and it is the best hotel form the harrah's owned - hotels (which takes up a huge chunk of the strip).,, \n\nfor the most part, we enjoy our stay. certain towers have better rooms - so the augustus tower is the best one - altho they have nice upgraded rooms at the other towers as well. they are also scheduled to open a new tower soon and upgrade the rest. \n\nthe pools have been revamped - so there are more pool areas to lounge around. i have only seen this a couple of times, but they do have 'goddesses' passing out frozen grapes. \n\nfor gaming, they are more on the $$$ side, so if you are not looking to play big in terms of table games, you may want to visit a different casino. otherwise, the dealers are nice enough. it can definitely get crowded on weekend evenings. \n\nfor food - they don't have the best assortment. the high end restaurants usually have great reviews but the buffet, cafe and other offerings are a bit sad. i do like payards (see my review) for quick sandwiches to go and pastries. the food court is so-so but a better option than some of the restaurants. serendipity is not bad. \n\nyou also have the forum shops - which is nice to walk around. it has a mixture of your regular mall stores as well as high-end stores. also has a better assortment of retaurants.\n\nwe enjoy our stays here. partly because it's free..."
1,The Carne Asada tacos are awesome ! I plan to be back to check out more menu items. I love the fact the Hobe meats counter is located inside the restaurant . I will need to pick up some to go items the next time I have time to cook .
1,"Holy yum. Wicked Spoon really lives up to the hype as one of the best (if not the best) buffets ever.\n\nArrived here on a whim with some girlfriends after checking into our hotel. Upon arriving, our wait was fairly short and we were seated at a clean, large table. The buffet options are ENDLESS. Literally. There is food from nearly every corner of the earth, and the little stylistic touches of serving certain dishes in mini steel pots or little Chinese take-out boxes were adorable. My favorite dishes were the ceviche, shrimp n grits (significant because I normally hate grits), paella, and panko crusted salmon (I think you get the gist, I'm a HUGE seafood fan). The salad bar was amazing as well--so many different salad options with a diverse range of toppings, which is excellent since I'm very picky about salad fixings. I barely had enough room for dessert--and by that I mean I literally only had room to sample a couple of dessert options. Wicked Spoon is an awesome buffet and I'll be sure to stop by here next time I'm in Vegas!"
1,"So I came here since a good friend referred me to it. The restaurant has been open for 2 months so fairly new. Love the restaurant ambiance, dim lighting, sugar skulls, very comfortable seats, big tv's for the bar, and great selection of tequila. \n\nWe sat down at the bar and had Jessy as our server/bartender I believe. Very knowledgeable, we came in for happy hour which is 3-6 pm, $1 street tacos , 3 dollar domestic beers, 4 dollar imports, and 4 dollar well drinks. All beers are in bottle, no draft beer here.  \n\nThey ask you if you would like any chips and salsa they give you 3 types of salsa mild, med, and hot. All 3 were very good.\nFor the tacos I had 1 of each they have 5 types. Top 3 are the Carnitas, alpastor, and cochinito. Get those 3 and you will be extremely happy, especially paying 1 dollar each. The Margarita was decent but not bad.  \n\nWe got 7 street tacos, 1 domestic beer, 1 margarita, beans and rice and only paid 19.47 so yeah I definitely think this place earns 5 stars."
0,My husband and I come into the restaurant about twice a month. We love the ambiance and the food. But I cannot help notice the last few times that we have been in there we have heard the general manager talk down to his employees openly in the restaurant. One of the instances happened to be tonight. I happen to be a restaurant manager and this is unacceptable. I will be making sure that the owner will know about my experience tonight. I will not be returning to the restaurant and I will making sure my friends know about this.
1,"I've only hiked Camelback once, but I felt so accomplished (albeit winded, and mere minutes away from passing out).\n\nWe started the hike at 6 in the morning, and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail.  I thought it wasn't going to be a bad hike, but things get tougher about two-thirds up.  Things starting getting vertical at some points, and I wasn't really prepared for that.\n\nIt was totally worth it once we got to the top, though - gorgeous, 360 view of the Phoenix metro area (and really, much more than that).  And watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too."
0,"very expensive but very average.  The steaks are aged and decent, and the appetizer menu is vast, but you pay WAY too much money to get, well, just ok.  It's also hard to have a conversation with all the noise, which I usually dont mind at all... but for some reason it was very distracting at this particular restaurant.  Heard many good things about it and went back a second time but the bill was just as expensive and the food was just as ordinary, so I think I'll choose other places in Montreal since there are so many wonderful places to dine in this city!"
1,"Great service: When my wife and I went, there were only 2 servers, 1 host, 1 bartender, and 2 cooks, yet all table were attended well (from what I could see) and the servers were working together as a team- Good Stuff! \n\nReasonable prices: 3 entrees, an appetizer and 3 alcoholic drinks for under $80. \n\nTry the pulled pork sandwich! It's sweet, savory, creamy, soft, crunchy; a very complete sandwich."
0,Man what happened this location has gone downhill in the past few months wheres the old crew that made this location special!!!!?????
0,"Extremely over rated restaurant the food is very bland. You can open any bag of lettuce and dress it poorly to get the same result. The service was terrible. The waitresses are rude and once they take your order you will never see them again \n\nWhen I asked what was recommended the waitress was completely put out. When i asked for a four top in the main dining room the miserable idiot they hired for a hostess could not have been less gracious., she wanted to put us in the back shitty add on when the main dining room was 1/2 full  Their style is pure 70's shabby chic gone stale. The food cannot amaze anyone unless you have been living on hospital food. Do not waste your time and money. This place has jumped the shark."
1,"First time visiting Yard House and although there were a few hiccups overall I really enjoyed it. First off Steven our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable and helpful with us in navigating the large menu. They have a ridiculous amount of beer on tap and I had two of Stevens suggestions that were fantastic. \nThe food is where the experience lacked a bit. I ordered a steak salad as I wasn't too hungry my wife got the filet. Both were over cooked even though I ordered med rare and my wife medium. Both steaks were med well, but since we aren't too picky we ate them without complaint. They were OK. Honestly nothing special but good. \nThe Desert trio souffl\u00e9s were delicious and we left satisfied with our New Years eve dinner. We for sure will be back in the future."
0,"Due to my rating, I feel I must start off on a positive note. The employees here are stellar! They are very friendly and appreciate the fact that you have chosen their gym to work out in. I have belonged to two other gyms before and their customer service and friendliness does not compare by a long shot. So I must say, this location has the best employees ever!\n\nNow for the ugly. This gym is completely worn down. The equipment is very old and outdated and a lot of it is either out of service or not working up to par. One morning, I jumped to three different stationary bikes until I found one that operated properly. And a lot of their stationary bikes do not have water bottle holsters, which means I have to power through 15-20 minutes of cardio with my water on the floor next to the machine and not readily available to me when I need a quick refreshment through my burn.\n\nI was a member of this gym two years ago, and was with them for four years (five years total counting when I worked out at the one near Summerlin on W. Sahara) and thought it was ok. But, in comparison to the one I worked out at off of W. Sahara and being a member of LVAC for the past two years, this location has the absolute worse gym equipment I have come across. Sad day.\n\nI have to admit that I am going to test out Club Sport here sometime soon, solely based upon the fact that this location's equipment is just lackluster, outdated and poorly maintained. I hope the manager here and the 24 Hour Fitness brand reads these reviews and does something about this. As mentioned, love the employees and the people that work out here are super nice as well, but as a gym, it just doesn't cut it. At least not for me."
1,"Love this place.  A great place for breakfast but the cakes are amazing, and real buttercream if you choose buttercream.  Growing up in the Midwest and having a grandfather as a dairyman my grandmother threw a stick of butter in everything.  She lived until she was 83.  So much for they theory it's bad for you.  I can taste the real deal on first bite.  Not margarine, not shortening but butta real butta.....the melt in your moth savor every bite kind.  Great for birthday cakes, wedding cakes, corporate events,  any given Tuesday...let me see yes any reason to have cake.  Like I say in my description more of a sweetie than a foodie.  I just found out that they rent the restaurant for private events.  She has the entire restaurant for YOUR private event.\nI would say 30 - 50 people?"
1,"Have been there a couple times and love it!  The food is delicious, but tonight our service was terrible.  We had one appetizer and left.  Really bummed because it was my Birthday :-("
1,"We bring our two dogs (German Shepherd and Golden Retriever) here all the time! Usually on the weekends, we drive 45 min just to come here!\nWe love it & so do our pups!\nGreat drink deals too!\nKiddie pools in the summer to keep your pup nice and cool!\nGreat atmosphere! but you MUST be a dog lover!\nNever seen a fight or anything. Sometimes you see one or two dogs trying to boss around others (there is a grey pitbull, that I think belongs to an employee that always does that) but nothing serious. \nWish there was one of these closer to Gastonia/Kings Mountain!"
0,"Incredibly disappointed with Take Paws. We had a wonderful dog walker initially through them, but when she left for another job our next dog walker had minimal experience being around dogs and was unable to walk our 2 dogs at once.  We are currently looking for another dog walking service."
0,"Never again!  This place was disgusting. I specifically stopped by here to get fresh and healthy food. By was I wrong because there is nothing fresh about this place. We ordered a chicken salad wrap, gyro wrap, falafel wrap, and hummus. All the meats and falafel a were pulled out of a freezer and cooked frozen. Was disgusting. Never going back. How do u advertise a place as fresh food when everything comes from a freezer I can make my own frozen food don't wanna pay for it"
0,"Based purely on service. . .  10 people (3 groups),  10 minutes,  6 empty tables,  2 servers,  0 eye contact,  0 acknowledgement to  people waiting to sit.  Horrible,  maybe burgers are good,  but I do not like being ignored."
0,"I needed my hair styled for my sorority formal. I thought going to a teaching salon would be a cheaper and less time consuming alternative than driving home to see my hair dresser. The student I was assigned was running late so I had to wait about 15 minutes until someone was available. I took a picture of exactly what I wanted. She asked several questions an I showed her exactly where I wanted the bun and told her I wanted a lot of volume. The first time she finished my hair I asked is she could change a few things and she ended up redoing it. The second time she could tell I still wasn't happy. She said she didn't know how to fix it and asked me what she should do. Her supervisor came over and messed with my hair a little but I was still unhappy. I paid, went to my car, cried, and took a picture. I sent the picture to my friends and family. They said I should do it myself and that I shouldn't have paid for the horrible work the student did!"
1,"My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me.\n\nI started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh.\n\nNext, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful.\n\nAfter having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :) \n\nI received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!"
0,"You are only paying for the view. The food was uninspired at best. This places tries to be a gourmet room, but in reality is a cheesy tourist trap. Trust me - you can skip this one."
0,Absolutely poorest management. Service was horrible. Truly horrid. Lots of staff walking around.  Our waitress was totally inefficient.  Lots of wasted steps.  She was gone from her section for long periods.  Pork and bread were dry.  Not as good as the Lucilles at the District.  And also they need busboys/girls. Overstaffed but inefficient.  Bartender is also waiting tables plus serving at the bar plus performing bartender duties.  Will not be back.
1,"Awesome place, love it!!!  My first time and everyone was so nice. Love the blueberry / vanilla goat cheese and the meat section!!!"
0,"After a visit to Glittering lights we were looking for a place to eat and so hungry we stopped at the first place.  Well after years of looking, I finally found a place with a worse buffet than circus circus.  There was litterally nothing edible other than the salad which was borderline. If you are on a diet, this is the buffet for you.   They had several things that were unidentifiable.  We couldn't even eat the soup.\n\nDissapointing because the concept seemed good and the kitch level is mid to high."
0,"Wow. The only word that I can use to describe the sushi here is terrible. It was totally tasteless, and that after I waited 30 min (10 extra) to get takeout. I was almost suckered into getting a drink at the bar waiting the extra 10 minutes... $25 was enough for the two tasteless roles and cold edemame.\n\nIt is a very chic space and I would imagine the ambiance would be nice for a happy hour or date. However, I just can't get over the sushi."
0,"This miserable excuse for a car rental office is a revolting, disgusting, insult to good business practices everywhere.\n\nThese Las Vegas airport Hertz people should all just go home and figure out something they can do for a living with some minimal standard of competence, dignity and self-respect. As for their current jobs, they simply fail on every level, miserably.\n\n\""Reservations\"" here are meaningless. If people haven't returned their rental cars on schedule, you simply have to wait. A long time. TWICE.\n\nFirst, you have to wait in a barely moving, packed-in queue full of pissed-off travelers who just got off long airplane rides and endured the miserable shuttle-buses that take you from McCarran Airport to the little rental car city here. There are only a couple of \""customer service\"" people manning the desk. All look defeated, hopeless and unavailable.\n\nSome people in the line are trying to pull rank by getting Hertz telephone agents on their cell phones, some of whom instruct them to cut in front of you and get to the next available clerk. But no matter, there are no cars.\n\nYou're told there are no cars when you finally make it to the front. When you ask \""how long will it be\"" they have no answer for you. I spoke to one German couple, who had been waiting for 45 minutes AFTER getting through the first line, with no relief in sight. In fact, the whole damn place was FULL of people, WITH confirmed reservations, who had made it through the first line and were waiting for one of the overworked and overwrought agents to call their name.\n\nAdding insult to injury there was a snotty little Hertz lobby girl marching around like her shit didn't stink with a bad, bad, BAD attitude, pouncing on people who wanted to use one of the automated kiosks--there were several of them, but apparently little snotty wouldn't let more than one of them be used at any given time. They didn't appear to do anything anyway. One customer who wouldn't put up with her foul energy for one second literally started screaming at her at the top of his lungs. I gave him a round of applause.\n\nFinally, over an hour later, our name was called and we went through all the credit card and paperwork crap and were told our car was waiting for us in parking space number: *fucking whatever* but when we got up there, the completely wrong car was in the spot. We tried to get someone's attention in the VIP club upstairs which looked even more fucked up and disgusting than the regular one downstairs, but had to totally cut in line and blurt our situation out to an emotionless little robot who informed us we had to go back downstairs to straighten things out. \n\nOf course, our clerk downstairs was surrounded by 15 new people, several of whom were asking lost-and-found questions and others doing god knows what. This time we miraculously succeeded in getting him to assign us a real car that actually existed, and finally got on our way.\n\nChecking the car back in was easy, but who the crap cares?\n\nFolks, this is not my father's Hertz...he used to be so proud! His plane would land and his shiny, pristine car would be waiting at the curb, handed over by polite efficient employees with pride and self-respect. I have no idea what's happened to the corporate culture here to allow things to slip so deep into the sewer, but I'll do everything in my power to NEVER patronize this piece of crap company again as long as I can drive."
0,"This place kinda sucked. We went araound lunch time so it was almost at full capacity I fig it would be ok since it was full and all. It looked like there was 2 people working here. I give props to the mex girl cooking all the food. It's cafeteria errrr um Subway style mexican food they ask you what you want and add it to your burro or w/e you get a tray and sit. I had a veggie burrito which was basically rice and your choice of black or pinto beans they did have 3 tortilla's to choose from. It was a pretty big burrito and fairly good but nothing special. The kid had a chicken quesadilla which was tiny they put like maybe a tablespoon of chicken in it with a side of cinnamon chips they gave her like 4 chips and a small ftn drink not very much for the 4.25 kids meal if you ask me. Their Salsa bar was disgusting with wilted cilantro, salsa's, limes and lemon's. The only plus here is the drinks! They serve good beer here Modelo, dos XX, Cuervo rita's, and even 99 cent margaritas everyday which I did not try. They also had fountain jugos. I may go back next time but more for the drinks."
1,"Sopporo is in my opinion, the best sushi in Scottsdale. The best time to hit it is during lunch or happy hour. It gets pretty packed in the evening, but during the day I say sit at the bar and have a Vegas Roll, my favorite item on the menu. \n\nThe prices are a little steep in the evening, but usually they have all day happy hour, and that's where it's at. The service is always good, I've never had a bad experience there."
1,"Wow! This is on my list of top food spots in Vegas. Came here on a Sunday night with my BF for dinner. Everything we ordered was excellent!  Not too many sit down customers at that time. A lot of walk ins getting pastries to go. Pastries are in the front,  cafe is in the back.\n\nWe ordered beef bourguigon, which came in a small pot and 3 mini bread slices. I ordered the French onion soup and quiche dinner combo. The quiche was ham and cheese,  but there are many to choose from.  Veggie and meat! It was the best quiche I've ever had!  Creamy, cheesy,  savory goodness. \n\nWe couldn't leave without visiting the pastry counter. Their macaroons are a bargain at $1.10 each. Salted carmel was to die for! We also got a slice of truffle chocolate cake - also a steal at $4.50 a slice, wait till you see the size of it! Crazy good! Moist and chocolatey!\n\nThis is an amazing French bakery!  Must try it!"
0,"Food was meh, okay. Not amazing and life changing. Not awful. I liked the apple and kale salad, wicked Mac and cheese, and the desserts. The passion mango sorbet and chocolate covered strawberries were awesome. \nThe price was fair - we went on a Tuesday around 11am. It was $26/person. Here is where they went wrong. My husband and I weren't aware and were never told that with that price it included a glass of champagne, mimosa, or a Bloody Mary. We could barely get our server to give us water and coffee. She seemed so annoyed being there and so she never mentioned this minor detail to us. When I heard the table next to us ask her about it when we were about to leave, she confirmed. So on our way out, I mention it to some employees standing around. Their solution? Offering me one of those drinks to go. I think they missed the point and they missed the chance to have us visit again. Will not be back. \nIf things had been made right or at least rightish, they would get higher stars."
1,"My favorite big place to see a concert! Its a small venue that is still able to capture the big acts (The Killers, Smashing Pumpkins). I also agree that there is not really a bad seat in the house, and its always nice and cool inside - especially in the summer! Its also pretty cool for a comedy show  (Dave Chappelle), and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour was filmed there. Now downtown just needs some better nightlife to accompany the venues down there! Oh also, something better than $8 beers please.. come on!"
1,"Really, As good as it gets 5 stars!! I'm talking about the food!"
1,Nice happy hour! I love the fried chicken wings with minced garlic and jalapeno peppers. Green Chicken Curry is also very yummy!
0,"we have been to red velvet cafe many times...here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:  \n- Great desserts (mini vegan cakes) at under 250 calories.  \n- Great guacamole and outstanding hummus (not on menu anymore but you can still get it).  It costs more here than the same order at the Fashion Mall location, I believe.\n- Never very crowded\n\nCons:\n- Pricey!  (esp. the cookies!)\n- Don't stay open past 8 pm\n- Some of the worst wait staff I've had - it is consistently bad - have had a couple of different guys and girls - both equally pathetic.  You will need to flag them down for a refill of tea.  Went there last night and waited 15 min before the guy came and took my order.  \n- Again, Pricey for what you get!  Our tab was more than $86 for dinner /tea/desserts(I had a wrap and tea and dessert) - we did not have any appetizers.  Imagine if we would have had good service, the bill would have been higher due to higher tip!  LOL!\n- Not many table tops that will hold 4+ people -- I think maybe 6-7 total.\n\nWe made our mind up last night, after the consistent bad service and high tab for an average meal that we won't go back there again except for desserts and that will be \""to go\""...\n\nThe owner/chef is there a lot - I don't know why she doesn't notice that her wait-staff is horrible and killing her business.  She also needs to lower her prices by 10-15%...She should read these reviews or at least have a suggestion box at her register..."
1,"I have been to many Apple stores over the years. From New York on down the east coast. The staff in the Northlake Mall Apple store are the greatest. They are friendly and responsive. It is a great experience for me every time I go to the Genius Bar or go for my One-On-One. The products and knowledge are the same in most Apple stores but the service is exemplary in Northlake Mall, Charlotte."
0,"I don't have an opinion on Dr. Hart, this review isnt about her its about their policy of canceling within 48 hrs and if you don't they want to charge you $48 dollars. This is ridiculous especially when your appt is Monday and they are closed Saturday and Sunday. I called them as soon as they opened at 8am and the person that answered the phone didn't care if I was sick and can't make they appt, she was nothing but robotic in her answers. I told her I will not pay $48 due to the reasons above and I will have no choice but to see another dentist, she said she would make a note of that on my account....I will not be coming back, really inconsiderate to customers"
0,major  rip off do not go went through it in 45 minutes waste of 30 dollars wasn't even scary big waste of money go someplace  sucks!
0,"Terrible hotel.  The website makes it look like a nice place, but in the end, it's a dump.  The building is run down and badly painted.  Our room had a weird odor and we found a huge roach in it.   The rooftop and pool are nothing like the pictures, and the restaurant had bland boring food.  They even authorized $65 out of my bank account to pay the $33.09 I owed them at checkout.  This is on top of the $50 authorization for incidentals.  When I called to complain, they obviously didn't care and referred me to my bank.\n\nOther Cons:\nNeed to ask the front desk for pool towels\nNeed to ask the front desk for ice (no convenient ice machine)\nRestaurant serves canned soda\n Uncomfortable bed \n\nPros:\nThe pool view rooms were large\nThe rooms themselves were cool with a fun and colorful decor"
1,"I love the product line they sell, prices are not cheep but I feel I always get what I pay for here.  VERY knowledgeable and informative staff.  It's a cute place and they are always great about getting me in last minute."
1,We ate here last night. It was surprisingly quiet on a Saturday night but we didn't complain. This off-the-strip burger joint was a good experience! We will be back! You get to make your own burger and they have meatless burger patties for our vegetarian friends. The chocolate milkshake was delicious! And everything  was fresh. Service was slow at first. It took a while for the waitress to come by at first. But after that it was all good! Try it out! It's off the strip but not far from it!
0,"I was there for a work dinner...I sat next to a co-workers wife who I did not know. We both ordered the 8oz fillet cooked medium; they both came back rare. We sent them back, which was no big deal, I had my sides on my plate and hers on her plate. They returned both our steaks, unfortunately they did not replete them on new plates AND they put my steak on her plate and her steak on my plate, we only knew this because we had different sides. VERY amature. Our server could care 'o less...he was probably upset that the wine we ordered wasn't $300 a bottle. I pointed out the error, they were semi-concerned. I didn't really complain, but wasn't too happy. The manager came over and apparently knew what happened, she graciously took both of our meals off the bill. I was appreciative. I would still not go back."
1,"Finally i got a chance to enjoy DTC picnic basket meal. My order was a meat + 3 - fried chicken + 3 sides (Mashed potatoes n gravy, hushpuppies and cornbread)\n\nNote: In the summertime the wait is hella long, my 45 minute wait became an hour wait, patience chile should be your mantra!\n\nThe fried chicken, though good, was not crispy enough for my liking, it lacked the crunchiness I crave. However, my 3 sides were the showstoppers! Hushpuppies with the sauce is amazing. I am guessing they are dipped in chickpea flour batter. The cornbread was warm and went well with the gravy.The gravy here is a nice peppery kind with the right amount of thickness and consistency.\n\nI wish there were more places like this which have a picnic basket option."
0,"I was intrigued by the computer kisok ordering, however not getting the human interaction/acknowledgement that your order was received on was uncomfortable for me.  I ordered thier Butter Chicken and was given the choice of either rice or naan (why can't I have both for the $8, I can add to get both for at least $1 extra) and a mango lassi.  I selected my order To-Go and awkwardly waited, wondering if they got my order, if I was supposed to wait at the counter for my mango lassi or if it all came out at once.   It wasn't busy (like 3 customers waiting on To-Go orders) but the employees appeared just as awkward trying to put the food together.  The man before me had ordered one of their Specials that day the Butter Chicken Wrap.   The Butter Chicken was way to saucy for a wrap and the workers were clearly flustered by the fact that it was busting thru the naan.  The employees there wanted to make it over for him but he said he would take it as is.  They make their naan one at a time, which means you get it fresh but adds to the wait.\n\nLike many of the other reviewers I waffled between 2 and 3 stars. While the food was good (not great), the awkwardness of the expereince has me dropping it to a 2.   Will I go back?  Yeah, until  I get a good Indian restaurant  downtown."
0,"I've tried contacting them over the phone and even through text as the phone message suggests and I have not yet received a reply. Even if they don't have the availability I need, I don't see why they can't respond through text to say when their next availability is. If I could give zero stars I would. I called and texted them at 10:30am today and it is now 10:45pm. Still no response. I have had zero luck on even speaking with someone at this business. I had high hopes for this place since it got good reviews."
1,"Cant beat the Trump for the deals that you can usually get it for a night. i always see it for around 100 bucks a nite. its hella nice in there, why would you pay the same price to stay at a lessor hotel?"
1,"Great ambiance. Fantastic service.  Aromatic coffee. Good music and decent reading materials. Overall, this place really deserves a bit of praise. It has that stylish, indi coffeehouse feel and good coffee to boot - none of that stale franchise coffee taste. The desserts are good, but nothing to write home about. No other food though, but there's plenty of restaurants close by. There's free wifi and tons of tables with power outlets. This is definitely a  primo place to hang out or kill time. It's generally a bit pricier than your standard Starbucks, but considering where it's located (Boca Park Summerlin) and the better overall experience, it's worth it."

1,"I love this location of Takamatsu.\n\nI frequented this location A  LOT when I used to live in PHX.\n\nAs far as Korean restaurants go- we all know that they aren't known for their remarkable service. This location of Takamatsu is the exception.\n\nKorean food here is really tasty for PHX standards, but the reason why my boyfriend and I kept coming back here aside from location was because of the service.\n\nEvery time we came here, the servers were very attentive and SUPER friendly. Even if they were deep in the weeds, they still managed to remain alert to our table- or at least apologize if they forgot something (which rarely happens at Korean restaurants).\n\nThey are far from cheap when it comes to their ban chan (side dishes).\n\nThe servers here work really hard, and I know you would have a great dining experience if you decide to check this place out."
1,"Love these guys. Can't say enough good things. They work 24/7, they came to my house and took full size rats out of my attic at 6 am (so I could still make it to work on time), and now they come regularly to spray around my house and yard for bugs.  Their prices are completely reasonable and they don't try to up sell you on unneeded things.  (Plus their website photos are awesome - with their cute little girls featured in them.)"
0,"2 stars b/c the patio is a great place to sit, and the resident pigeons were great entertainment. Plus the staff was fast and friendly, and the decor was really cute. =) \n\nOverpriced, gross turkey burger, and it didn't even come with fries. Looked like a charred hockey puck, and tasted aweful. I knew I should have just ordered a simple turkey sandwich. My husband's chili cheese dog was one of those scary red ones, covered in liquid, neon orange, nacho cheese. Again, overpriced, but his came with fries, which were very tasty.  He didn't seem to like it so much, but he ate it b/c he paid for it.\n\nDon't waste your money on food, just get dessert."
1,"i finally finally made it to panevino! i always heard people gush about it and i pass it everyday but never got a chance to try it.. the restaurant was extremely impressive. modern architechture inside and modern decor as well. the view of the strip from the restaurant is amazing, and the ambiance was very relaxing.\n\nthe food was even better than i thought. the minestrone was the best i have ever had. really well made.. truly italian.the filet mignon was unbelievable! one of the best steaks ive had. cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth. youll wish you could have five more of them. its sooo good! i tried the lobster ravioli and omg it was heavenly. lobster and ravioli ratio was just right and the sauce was really good. i tried my friends pasta with seafood and it was amazing as well. perfect sauce perfect linguini. \n\npanevino is definitely one everybody should try at least once. it is a little pricey... actually its very pricey but its worth every penny. the food is soo good you will keep dreaming about it til the next time you go back. it is the perfect date place. so romantic, excellent views and relaxing ambiance. and kudos that the manager is there and is an honest to goodness italian man. if you're fluent in italian you can talk to him and tell him how great his place is."
1,"Love this place!  Well the food and vibe were great.  Service not so much.  I went here with some girlfriends for lunch during the week.  They have many great, fresh items on the menu.  My friend and I decided to split the Sunflower Salad and the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas.  Both dishes were divine!  Our server was very slow and we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  They also seemed to be promoting special happy hour items which sounded really good.  \n\nDespite the bad service, I will definitely be back.  The food is too good to pass up!"
0,"Seriously, this place gets on my nerves. I come in to tutor a couple kids one day a week. The Asian lady at the adult services desk is in serious need of a personality - very unfriendly. Then, the security guards are on an authority high. You can barely even have a whispering conversation in the study rooms. I get harassed while talking to a parent yet there is a crying child or idiot watching videos on his phone in the room next to me. I don't know if these people just don't like people tutoring there or if this is normal behavior, but I'm pretty done with being told I'm too loud when I'm not (I'm seriously not, I know what appropriate library behavior is) and getting dirty looks from cynical library employees."
0,"I went on a Thursday at around 6:00 PM.   I overlooked the fact I was the only patron there (MAJOR CLUE).     I ordered the falafel; they were out. (WTH, are you kidding me?)   I ordered the lamb kabob and was advised it would take 30 minutes to cook; I declined.  I ordered a gyro thinking that would be quick; it wasn't.  How long does it take to carve meat off a rotating spit?  15 minutes evidently...  Did I mention I was the only one there?  OK enough about the lack of service and the fact the staff/owners were outside smoking right by the entrance.  I don't know about you, but I hate second hand smoke as I am about to dine or right after.   Anyway,  I am saving the worst for last. \n\nThe meat was so dry and salty as to be inedible.  I left most of it on the plate.  Honest to goodness, no exaggeration,  it was the worst gyro I have ever had.   I suspect it had been cooking for days or even weeks for all I know,  since all I got was the \""toasted\"", dried-out pieces and none of the moist parts from the inside.  If you think I am kidding go and try it, but go to the grocery next store first.   I walked in, took a breath and almost got sick.  I walked out and went through the aforementioned \""smoke-curtain\"" to what I thought was going to be a decent Middle Eastern dinner.   \n\nFor record,  I LOVE Middle-Eastern food and the associated smells.  For those of you that have rated this the place to go, I am glad you like it.   I hated it I mean REALLY hated it and will not go back unless I lose a bet.\n\nFor me, that place in Tempe (Haji-Baba)  is still the best, by far, but sadly it is too far for me to drive for just a meal.   For those of you in Tempe, I remain envious."
1,"I'm a very cool & happy customer customer thanks to Visca A/C. \n\nAfter getting the once over by 2 other a/c companies (one was a big name in the valley) I was referred by some one at work to Steve. He evaluated my a/c system and gave an honest estimate without trying to upsell me extra repairs for an additional cost. My evap coil was leaking. As it's only 7 yrs old, it should still be covered under the 10 yr parts warranty, but the SN# was scratched and difficult to read. Steve worked with the distributor to find the SN# and make sure that I didn't incur additional costs.\n\nHe was not only an affordable option but the first available to make the warranty repair.\nI would (and have) recommend to a friend without hesitation."
1,"As a visitor from out of town I wanted something healthy and vegetarian. This little gem of a restaurant is amazing!  Get the \""Misr\"" ... A delish lentil dish!!! Yum :)"
1,"I won here while visiting my brother! I've never won this much before! If I'm ever in this casino again, I'm so playing this machine. Parking was easy and cocktail waitresses are fast and friendly. Wouldn't mind coming here again."
1,I love this market . fresh food!
1,Got an amazing deal on a great car. \nDrove all the way from Bay Area to get it and so far there are no problems with it. \nCouldn't be happier. \nThe staff was helpful and never pestered us like most dealers do and even gave us a good discount. \nWe were helped by Greg and the finance guy. \nI'm pretty sure that I would buy from them again despite the distance because the experience was so amazing!
1,"This has got to be one of my favorite sportsbooks in Vegas!! Why you ask?  Because it is LITERALLY...the WORLD'S LARGEST RACE & SPORTSBOOK!!  Can you even imagine? It's not even called a sportsbook...it's called a SPORTS SUPERBOOK!!  I didn't think it was going to be that great but I sure was wrong!!  My biggest pet peeve about sportsbooks is that you can never find a seat..but at the Hilton you will probably be able to plop your booty somewhere.  There are a ton of seats here!! You got the standard comfy chairs & then you have a ton of stools & tables.  You can also order food from some of their fast food places and then grab a seat there while you watch on their like 923756 TV screens.  There were TVs everywhere!! I was like OMG... I can't sit anywhere and watch what I want.  It was amazing!!! \n\nAlso, there were a ton of betting windows.  Like a TON & there were so many different things to bet on...you can like parlay anything. Hahaha.  It was a sports betters heaven.  Plus, who can say no to free drinks?!?!? \n\nIf I were to go anywhere to watch a great football game & be around a bunch of crazy sports fans..I would definitely go here!! \n\nPlus, during the reg season the Hilton has this Football Center in one of their theaters where you can watch major football games on the MEGA theater screen.  HELL YES.  It's like a football party in there!!! LOVE IT!"
1,"Came here on Sunday for lunch and had an absolutely delicious halloumi burger, while my boyfriend had the Aussie beef burger. Whatever rumours of legendary burgers exist about the Cambridge Bar, they're all true. Both burgers were generously portioned--typical halloumi burgers feature a small slice of halloumi but this one was enormous--and well-seasoned and very, very tasty. We also had vanilla and peanut butter milkshakes were are even now making my mouth water just thinking about them. Next time I have a hankering for a burger, this is absolutely where I'd go, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly."
0,"Considering that Gourmet magazine said it was the best Thai restaurant in North America, AND that Frommers highly recommended it, I expected a lot more. My boyfriend and I both had the wonton soup (excellent) and the chicken with cashew nuts. Personally, I've had much better at other Thai restaurants. \n\nIt's a run-down little place, but obviously plenty of people know about it. Autographed pictures with celebrities adorn the walls. Service is okay, but nothing exceptional. It was often hard to track down our server."
1,We finally tried the Red Rock location and we liked it.  There were big portions and I couldn't even finish my meal. We tried the Fried Dill pickles.  It was pretty good.
1,"Went to Postrio with my mom and 2 sisters on a Vegas 4-day girls trip. It was our Thursday night choice and we were all very pleased! I made a reservation and was immediately seated. The hostess told me that they don't seat inside the restaurant during the weekdays but it worked out perfectly because we wanted to sit \""outside\"" (in St. Marks Square). I am a vegetarian so I ordered a salad, I think the menu is different from the on online because I can't find it. But it was definitely yummy! Good portion too. We ordered 3 pizzas, the wood oven roasted mushrooms/leeks/rosemary/goat cheese, house made pepperoni/kalamata olives/slow roasted tomatoes and the 'margheria' pizza. All were super big and very tasty. The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything and it was my older sister's birthday so after we ate they brought out this very gorgeous raspberry souffle with 3 different small bowls of sauce. The waiter then takes his spoon and breaks open the souffle and pours each one in as he explains what they are. WOW it was magnificant! I wouldn't usually order something that is raspberry but now I will definitely give it chance! It was $11 and he took it off the bill, very nice! Overall great restaurant - definitely worth the try if you in the area :)"
1,"I've been here twice- once at daytime and the other at night (part two of my first date with my husband, back in January 2004). It's a different experience at both times but sweeping views either way. During the daytime, I remember seeing my alma mater, UNLV. Of course, the experience is a thousand times more romantic when it's seen at night (especially with the right person). The Strip looks its best at night, in all its neon lighted glory (am I right?). One of the four best places to see the views (Stratosphere, The Foundation Room, The VooDoo Lounge).\n\nThis is a half scale replica of the original one in Paris. I recommend seeing the view from both times (if you can swing it)- it really is a different experience at each time. There is a coupon in the Vegas.com magazine available at casinos all over (picked up at Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood). No time limit, so hang out here, linger, it's alright, no Eiffel Tower police here. Don't recommend if it's super windy (might be even worse for allergy sufferers)."
1,"Very good food and yummy drinks! It is my husband's and my date night. If you like martinis this is the place.  I get the Lactose, it's light and refreshing. My husband gets the Makers Side Car which has orange flavoring paired nicely with the whiskey. A definite try here is Surprise."
0,"1 star because 0 stars is not an option...\n\n\nAfter reading all of the positives reviews about this bridal store, I was thrilled to make a reservation here for my sister. The girl on the phone was very sweet and helpful. \n\n*Keep in mind we are looking to spend approximately $2,500 or so on a bridal gown which is WELL above the average price of a gown here.\n\n\nFast forward to the day of our appointment:\n\nWe walk through the door and are completely ignored for the first 10 minutes. The girls at the front desk are busy gossiping so we decide to at least look around a bit and that's when one of the girls approaches us with a confused look on her face \""Um.. Can I help you?\"" Caught off guard by a somewhat accusing statement, we tell her we have an appointment and she directs us to the front desk where we wait a few minutes for the girls to stop gossiping. We were then assigned an associate to help us; she asks the bride details about her wedding theme and her dream dress. We select dresses to try on and are directed to the fitting room/seating area. \n\nMy sister emerges from the fitting room in her first dress and the associate takes off; no questions about the dress or anything... back to the front to gossip. My sister stood there literally holding up her dress because the associate failed to secure the clamps so I promptly jumped up and helped her. After determining that the dress was not for her, my sister headed back to the fitting room, and that is when the associate showed up again. \n\nAfter 6 gowns and 6 of the same exact experience, our very annoyed bridal party finally got up to leave the salon. On our way out I passed a girl headed to the fitting rooms with 4 dresses in her arms. A different associate from the store promptly walks up to her and asks \""Where are you going?\"" to which she replied: \""To try these on, I called this morning to ask if there were any openings and there were! The girl on the phone told me I could come in and try these on.\"" The associate then rudely told the girl that she couldn't just try on dresses without an associate's help and that she would have to come back in 2 hours if she wanted to try anything on. The girl, who was about in tears and mortified, repeated her situation and that she was told she was allowed to try on dresses. The associate snapped back \""You will have to speak with my manager.\"" I was completely disturbed by the whole situation, it was like the movie Pretty Woman all over again. \n\nI hate to post a bad review but our experience was horrible. If you are looking for the \""bridal experience\"" this is not the salon. Our next appointment was at Lillian Lottie Couture; they were wonderful and helped us pick out the perfect gown."
1,"OMG I Love this place! The Calamari was super fresh! And the lemon aioli sauce was so refreshing, it was an explosion of flavors! My husband ordered the steamed muscles and was completely satisfied! They were cooked to perfection and were soooo fresh! I ordered the Main Lobster and it was freaken HUGE! It was definitely more than I expected! Oh and did I mention their oysters were on sale that night? They were like $8.00 a dozen and fresh and so tasty! Our server was so polite and very knowledgeable about the menu. \nThe price was a little steep but definitely worth it!"
1,"After 4 years, I found this to be the best place for pizza. Service is fantastic, and the food is amazing. The fire pizza oven chars the crust just a tiny amount to give it an excellent flavor. Sauce, crust... spot on. Happy to have them here in Phoenix!"
0,"Let's see,  tables and slots did not pay out.  Cocktail waitresses did not make rounds at the slots and it took me 20 minutes to get my drink at the tables after I ordered.  Speaking of the drinks, I don't believe it had a lick of alcohol in them and I was tipping well. I only gave 2 stars due to their friendly staff and decent decor."
0,I used tatman's to have a few small scratches removed.  The workmanship was alright but the customer service was mediocre at best.  It took many visits to ensure the job was done correctly.  I would recommend you look elsewhere for better service.
0,Palak Paneer and Benghan Bartha were wayyy too salty for anyone's taste. Not sure if it was MSG or salt but it left us feeling a little ill after dinner and we could barely eat any of it.  The garlic naan was delicious and the rice was good. The waitress seemed hurried and not as hospitable as one would expect.
1,"Eduard and Nissan are absolutely great guys.  I have been going to V's for four years now and I have always walked away happy with my cut.  Both gentlemen are great at what they do, very personable and I really cannot say enough about how much I look forward to going to V's to get cleaned up.\n\nBoth gentlemen are consistent with their approach: prep, cut, clean up with the straight razor (oh man I love that touch) and then the hot towel wrap followed by a scalp massage.  Sadly what they do so well is becoming a lost art, but I am glad to be able to have a place to go once every few weeks where I feel like I am experiencing some of the simple luxuries without breaking the bank."
1,"Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.\n\nThank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D"
1,"Been ordering from Sardella's for years. Long before yelp was but a whisper.\nGreat pizza and wings. I think I have only been let down once, but I even question my memory on that.\nEverything always arrives hot when I order delivery."
1,"Glad that we found a place with an atmosphere reminiscent of our Blind Onion at home. MM has an excellent beer selection, which is great for self proclaimed beer snobs like my BF and  I. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how someone would drink a Girl's Light when there are so many more fantastic tasty beers available! But I digress....So far the only pizza we tried has been the buffalo chicken. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was! Fresh ingredients are clearly obvious. The only draw back is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but I am definitly up to try more of their menu."
1,"The decor, food, and service are outstanding. It is on the more expensive side, especially for dinner. Do lunch if you want the experience yet need to moderate your costs."
1,"I had been to a breakfast place here before called Le Peep, now as Butters Cafe I like the decor and the menu a lot better. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a great looking menu. I was stuck on three items and couldn't decide! I opted for the brioche french toast with bananas while my husband got the other item I wanted to try, the Eggs Verde. Both were delicious. Although I'm a sugar girl and brioche just sets my heart a flutter at the thought, his eggs verde with black beans and cheese was awesome. Not to mention the cheese grits that accompanied his meal. I've never had grits taste so....decadent! Our friends both go the Mexican breakfast burrito with the largest hashbrown I've ever seen! \nThe coffee was delicious and filled frequently. They left a water pitcher on the table, as well as a huge bottle of syrup. I can't stand that little syrup serving some places give you because you always run out....and there you're left....alone with your dry french toast....but not here! :) Great friendly service and very on top of cleaning up the table and checking on us!!"
0,"Decided to try lunch as it was close to my home.  Went in and was surprised to get both fried rice and chow mein, instead of having to choose one.  Also, went there for dinner, it was good.  My complaint was I ordered the large party trays for my sons b-day party.  I spent almost $200 and was not given anything extra such as crab puffs, egg rolls, etc.  NOTHING!!  When I ordered party trays from Jacky Chan, they gave me crab puffs, which are my favorites.  We haven't been to Rice n noodle, since and never will.  We aren't asking for hand-outs, but when we spend a couple hundred, include something extra, even a fortune cookie would have sufficed, but nothing gets you NO MORE OF OUR BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I love this place! The staff is very friendly and helpful. My lash artist, Chantel, is AMAZING! I have been a loyal customer for nearly a year now and would recommend it to everyone. Go get a free consultation! It will change your life...just a word of caution: be prepared for constant compliments on your lashes! :)"
0,"My girlfriend had 2 skirts altered by this place. Both for work purposes. The reason I am posting about this and not her is because I was the one who had to go pick it up and pay for it. \n\nI was amazed at how much it had cost for two business style skirts to get altered. They  had both sides taken in ( to make smaller). $36 a skirt for a grand total of $72. I came with $45 thinking that would cover the \""cash only\"" rule that still exists in today's world. So then I had to leave, go to an ATM then back to the place. Thinking the whole time, \""Might as well go buy her a new skirt,\"" but I have no fashion and she needed them!  So two weeks later and $72 in the hole we have skirts that fit. \n\nIs it great work yes. The people were really nice. If I needed it done over night I would probably pay that price. Inflating prices because of slow business.\n\nBusiness denied"
1,"A for Ambience.\nA+ for FOOD.\n4,5 stars for the rating but I'm rounding up because I feel like it, and because I can.\n\nThe Risotto..... oh, that damned Risotto, I can't stop thinking about that Risotto.  Bursts of flavor... mushrooms, saffron. whatever -  a perfect risotto, I think could eat pots full of this stuff for years.\nWe also had a sea bass dish - - flavorful, and cooked perfectly -  tender and absolutely fresh.  Yum.\n\nTheir fresh mozzarella and tomato was .... well, it was good, but keep in mind that the tomato is baked, and the mozzarella is melted on, unlike the regular fresh mozzie you'd expect.  I prefer it the other way, but it tasted good nonetheless.\n\nWe sat out on the patio, eating under the pseudo-but-wonderfully-bright Venice skies, surrounded by gorgeous architecture and statues, not to mention the Italian melodies that floated through the air, assisted by the great acoustics at the Venetian Grand Canal area.... \nWe were on a major timecrunch as we had to leave for the airport in 45 minutes.  This was to be the last meal during this particular Vegas trip.  We were assured we'd leave in time, we sat down to order, and our server was attentive enough to be good, but also left us alone to eat.  The food came out quickly, though I am not sure if this is because we made it clear were in a rush, and it was served percfectly.\n\nWe even had time left for coffee, but as is the case in the whole damned hotel - - the coffee leaves much to be desired.  Blech.  I swear, I say it again and again, that is the only bad thing about the Venetian.  BLECHY COFFEE.\n\nWe were surrounded by people on dates, early dinner meetings, as well as families with many, many children.  Canaletto's is one of those places that is appropriate for any age group, for any purpose, however formal or casual.\n\nOh, and the bread... with great olive oil.... ahh.\n\nDid I mention the freakin' RISOTTO????????  Holy smokes........"
0,"I bought stuff from this place twice. Tookmforever because the selection was bad and prices ridiculous. Quality not so good, for slver there were better dealsmat tj maxx than using a 100. Off coupon. They alsontried to tell us my wife's diamond was shattered when we inquired about a trade in. Most of their sales help were like used car salespeople and lied through their teeth. I had three negative shopping experiences here, returned everything bought, and found higher quality at lower prices elsewhere. BUYER BEWARE. Sorrt for typos, using my ipad."
1,"The first time that I ate here, I really really loved it, so I had to eat it again on my recent visit.  Sadly, it just wasn't the same.  It was still good, but just not as good as I remembered.  I remembered there being a much bigger variety when I was here two years ago, but on my most recent visit, it seemed lacking.  It seemed like it was a lot of the same meats and pastas.  The sushi also looked really unfresh so I stayed away from that.  The price was pretty good for dinner, so I decided to just load up on crab legs.  I would still definitely come here again because even though it wasn't the same, it was still pretty darn good."
1,"Family run Italian, at the heart of Hanover Street's array of restaurants, La Lanterna is something of an Edinburgh institution.\n\nOverall, we said: \""La Lanterna served our needs incredibly well. It offers a warm welcome, friendly service, hearty dishes full of satisfyingly home-spun gutsiness, and an atmosphere guaranteed to put you at your ease. Next time you need a little comfort and joy, pop along to La Lanterna and let them feed you. You'll leave feeling fully refreshed, deeply nourished, and fit to face the world anew.\"""
0,"Hands down WORST pizza I have ever had. I ordered a New York style thin crust pizza with pepperoni.  Mannn... this \""pizza\"" came out with more grease than an auto shop! The dough was thick and soggy in the middle and the cheese tasted like rubber. To top it off the waitress/bartender said \""Wow! Doesn't that look good?\""  HAHAHA SERIOUSLY?! Maybe she's never had a pizza before, but this was pure nastiness.  My bf and I just looked at each other and laughed. Sorry Nikki Lee's... nice people working there and you may make good drinks, but PLEASE refrain from calling that ball of grease on my table a \""pizza\""."
0,"Service was decent, even though it was busy for lunch both times.  Food came out quickly, once ordered.\n\nFor the quality level of the food the cost was a bit high.  I believe the lunch specials were around $10.  The Salsa was decent, but the cooked food was greasy.   They do offer the option of black beans instead of refried, which is nice.  There are large portions, but quality of ingredients isn't there, and food is somewhat bland, requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor."
0,"This store really lacks selection.  We went to the suit department, the selection was really no larger than a closet, when I asked for my size, they didn't even have it or I actually looked for it, there was no salesman around in the department.  When asked about another department in another part of the store, a salesperson gave us the wrong directions."
1,"Excellent place to grab pho or some hibachi for lunch. Gets very busy around lunch, so either get there before or after lunch hour or plan on waiting in line.\n\nTip - if you're ordering hibachi and want to spice it up, let them know when you order and they can add spice on the grill. Much better than adding the red sauce after."
1,"Had dinner last night with my wife, it was a very busy night. We arrived a little early but were still seated right away. The hotstees was very polite and friendly. We were greated promptly by our waiter Nigel. He was very knowledgeable and informative about the menu. We started off with a cocktail, My wife enjoyed the Cosmoploitan and myself im a beer guys so i stuck with the Sam Adams in a chilled glass. \n\nWe ordered the Kobe Meatball, which my wife had commented that it was the best meatball she has ever tasted. \n\nFor dinner i had the 32oz Lollipop Ribeye cooked Medium, which was absolutely perfect. My wife ordered the 18oz NY Steak asked for it well done, When it came out it was a little pink, but after letting it rest for a few minutes it was perfect for her. \n\nWe had and assortment of side dishes, Potato Augratin, Tater Tots, Roasted Mushrooms, and Mac n Cheese. Which all had a very good flovaors and contrasts in themselves.  We did perfcer the Potato Augratin the best. \n\nTo end the night we tried the Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream and it was a perfect ending to a great dinner."
0,"Poor service and was not impressed by the food. Wait staff didn't seem interested when taking our order. I had breakfast, the eggs were burnt and rubbery and the pancakes has sat under the warmer too long and did not taste fresh. Definitely won't be back here"
0,"The restaurant is located in Ceasar's and nothing to write home about. A couple friends and I were hungry and decided to give it a try. The food was average and the service was terrible. The menu was overpriced for the quality of food and service.\n\nPros: \n- Location\n\nCons: \n- Too Pricey\n- Service Terrible (we had to asked to be refilled several times, had to get up to get silverware because waiter forgot to bring some upon request)\n- Food Quality"
0,"THE POOL IS NOT HEATED! More on that later. \n\nCheapest of all Mark Taylor properties significantly in price and content. What you save in rent you pay for in other ways. \n\nI just renewed so obviously it's not the worst apartment complex in AZ but in comparison to any other Mark Taylor which are self described luxury apartments, the Arboretum falls way short. \n\nI have not seen any seedy underbelly and for semi-cheap rent it's a decent place to live. Problems that I've encountered here are minor but many and frequent. \n\nThe pool is swimmable but clean isn't the word I would use to describe it. It's the Arboretum so of course all the foliage and other plant life make it a nice view, but it also presents the constant problem of basically the entire complex from sidewalks to swimming pool to constantly be covered in their debris. Which wouldn't be bad if the grounds crew actually ever cleaned anything. You can always find a nice amount of bugs and leaves and dirt, in what my opinion considers an excessive amount, floating around or settled on the bottom of the pool. \n\nThe pool is not heated. No way. I'm from South Dakota and am one I those crazies who jump into big holes cut into the ice in a middle of a lake in the middle of winter. I know cold. For about four months when I first moved in here, October of 2013, I literally had the pool to myself. Not even on the weekends with the sun blazing through a clear sky wouldn't ever see anyone else at the pool. I jumped in the pool one Sunday by myself cause it was too cold for my girlfriend she thinks I'm crazy, the guy at the grill asked me if it was cold. \""It's freezing,\"" yelled the elder gentleman from his 2nd story balcony. I emailed the office and they responded stating the pool temp was at 80 and that they keep is between 79 and 82 and would ask maintenance to raise it by 2 degrees. At best I could tolerate the temp but mostly it was just unbearable. \n\nThe hot tub is usually broke down about every other month for weeks at a time and at least in my experience here, is not an exaggeration.  All but one or two of the jets work. The rest must have cracks because the bubbles don't come out of the jets but up behind the tiling of the hot tub wall. My favorite was the time we got in and I thought the rubber seal in the floor filter was showing. I was wrong. It was a bunch of leaves and twigs clumped up at the bottom looked like a beaver had been making a home.  \n\nI've been on the office five times due to the pool gates being locked as early at 8pm. The pool closes at 11pm. Last weekend in over a 100 degree weather the pool was locked on Saturday because the algae was too much and they had to shock the pool with more chemicals to clear it up. This weekend, 4th of July weekend, we had a nice dust storm whip through and trash the pool worse than I've ever seen. 1030am there was one guy with a small net skimming the pool. You would think being a pretty big weekend for families and all others alike wanting to grill out and hang at the pool, they would have made it a higher priority to have cleaned up. Here I am writing this at 1130am still watching the one guy with his net feebly attempting to make a dent in the mess which is the pool area. \n\nI recently switched apartments from the east side of the complex to the west. I'm only saving about $100 a month going from a two bedroom to a single, but there is a priceless benefit to my move. According to the staff \""this is a pretty old building and so is the plumbing\"".  Outside of my previous apartment as you walk to your vehicle, you get the joy of smelling the most disgusting stench. As disgusting as this sounds, my girlfriend and I debated as to whether it smelled more like vomit or fresh dog poop. Some days it took everything just to keep from throwing up as we gagged and ran to our vehicles. Apparently some of the staff was already aware of it. That was two months ago and it still persists. \n\nThe floor plans look nice but it's the little things that will drive you nuts. Stuff you probably won't notice til after a few months of living here. In my previous apartment, this sounds funny, in the master bathroom, the toilet is about two inches from the sink area. Let's just say if you have to wipe I hope your not right handed. The water pressure in the master bathroom sink was barely operational. My single room apartment has no storage space so I have containers of things like Christmas decorations and other stuff stacked in the corner of my bedroom and the area what should be my dining room. The kitchen design is horrible. The cupboards are set back in areas of corner next to the fridge which makes them virtually useless. There is only one normal sized drawer to hold my silverware and another which barely hold three cloth pot holders and one oven mitt. The washer is so loud and vibrating is insane. Television channels won't come in if its running. No joke. \n\nOops, hit the text limit will have to add another review to wrap up."
0,"I brought my laptop in because the USB ports weren't working.  The guy at the counter said it would be 3-5 days for them to look at it and get back to me.  I, then, watched as they took my laptop, put it into a plastic container, and set it on a shelf next to a couple of other containers.  Then the guy proceeded to go sit down with a couple of other employees.  What I don't understand is that if you work there, aren't you supposed to be working on the computers and not sitting and chatting with your co-workers?  I also felt that they didn't really care if it was an emergency to me (which it was) or not.\n\nFollow-up:  called and asked about selling my laptop if the motherboard wasn't working.  The guy on the phone told me the only way to tell me was by bringing it into the store and looking at it.  I asked him to just be honest and he wouldn't help me over the phone....called the Spring Mountain store and IMMEDIATELY was told it wouldn't be worth it.  Apparently someone at the Centennial store needs a reality check in customer service..."
0,"I'm not a huge fan of Applebee's, if you've eaten here through the years you know how much the food has changed; it's defiantly not like it use to be. I use to love heading to Applebee's for happy hour, but I'm not sure if this location gets that kind of business because the bar always seems to be slow. \n\nI'm a fan of the skinny margarita and honestly it's the only reason I ever want to put it out there for a resturant choice from time to time. The menu is pretty basic to me, nothing that sticks out so much anymore. There are so many other places that surpass what Applebee's is and it's too bad because in the 90's this was the spot. \n\nThis location is always inconsistent. Sometimes the food is meh and the waitstaff is also, and there have been times the experience has been good, so it's a hit and miss. I just cant give it more than 2 stars. The food just doesn't taste nearly as fresh and taken care of. It taste overly processed and standard. If this if like your favorite restaurant in the whole world (please venture out) than this experience may be expected or it may be sub par, this location produces, just-that"
1,"I really like it. Service was outstanding. Simple menu. Sleek and stylish decor. It's a beautiful addition to downtown Mesa. ER has so much potential! I had a lovely chat with the owner, Edmundo, who told us about his family, him being from Mexico and his wife from Costa Rica. The beautiful mural on the wall represents his family. It's awesome! You can tell there is a lot of love and passion behind this business. I also liked the fact that the owner was so friendly and open to suggestions and feedback.\n\nI was so very excited for ER to open since I lived in Chile for a year and ate empanadas nearly everyday. We ordered the El Capitan (it sounded the closest to the traditional Chilean empanadas I loved), and the Cubana. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the El Capitan. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting I guess. Cubana was very good. \n\nThey also had a really good lunch special. It was $7.50 for 2 empanadas, a side of beans, rice, and salad.(I think). Excited for them to get their liquor license and start offering local craft beers!\n\nI think ER has a lot of potential. Will be back to try the rest of the menu."
0,I was very excited to try a different restaurant for my Birthday but the experience was terrible.  It took 45 minutes to get sat they don't take reservations unless its 20 or more.  literally we sat there for over 10 minutes before our server even spoke to us.  He asked who wanted wine... and was about to walk away...not even going to ask if anyone at the table wanted a different drink.  He said he was going to bring bread sticks and we finally got them about an hour after being there.  Don't get me wrong the food was great but having to go thru all the crap to get good food is totally not worth it.  The server wouldn't split our check therefore making it tough to figure out how to pay.  The hostess said parties over 8 are no split checks but we only had 6 so what happened???    All in all you might want to try another restaurant in the casino or a different Italian restaurant if that's what you prefer
0,Bring your own water and food if your exhibiting or walking a show. It's overpriced and the lines are ungodly long.
1,"Good margarita's, good ceviche, and an awesome server; Aaron. Would come back for another visit:)"
1,"I brought my bike in, and within 10 minutes they had me out the door with a new tire. Very knowledgeable staff! The food is delicious as well."
1,"Hash was a smash for me. Also Tim the owner sang us a Dylan song. Great biscuits, also liked the potatoes. It is a must try if you are in Mad-town."
1,"This is definitely my go-to for best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It is always super high quality ingredients and great specials.  We went in on New Year's Eve which was a great idea with their BYOB policy.  We brought beer, wine and champagne and settled in for a fantastic meal. \n\nJ&B started with the infamous spinach dip.  Served with a whole loaf of their bread, it oozed gooiness.  J&I started with the special - lamb crepes.  Unbelieveable.  This should become a staple of the menu.  We also split a bowl of crab soup.  Spicy and filled with crab - delicious!  J had the scallops as his main course and was blown away by both the quality of the scallops as well as the extremely fresh veggies.  I had the salmon which is one of my favorites.  It's one of the few meals where you will feel completely full afterwards, but also very healthy.  J had the eggplant parm which is not normal eggplant parm, but is a much healthier, yet delicious alternative.  B had the steak which I believe is the best thing on the menu.  An awesome piece of meat covered with blue cheese butter.  Heaven.  \n\nWe ordered the chocolate flourless cake and the raspberry brown butter tort.  To say that these were good would be an understatement.  J&I ordered 3 desserts - 3.  We could have ordered more.  The raspberry tort was insane - buttery and sweet and mouth-watering.  \n\nGo!  Go now!   You won't be disappointed!\n\nOh, also cash only!  Be aware!"
0,Am so disappointed in this bank.If you wanna wait along time this is the right place .its not just once it's every time.They see no urgency I don't want to talk about my weekend just deposit  my money plz .am never gonna go in this one again.
0,"went in to replace radiator for my corvette.  The mechanic was totaly incompetant. mechanic had to disconnect transmission cooler lines, but could not figure out how to refill transmission fluid, or check it. mechanic said it is ok to lose transmission fluid. (about a quart was spilled on floor.)Mechanic installed wrong coolant. I insisted they install dexcool, as per mfr's strict guidelines.  After getting car home, i inspected for leaks, and found that several coolant hose clamps were not tightened at all, airflow baffles were not re-installed but were in the front bumper, fan shroud retaining parts were not installed, air cleaner not installed right, and a 103 dollar plastic air filter retaining clamp was broken in half. \n   I also discovered that transmission cooler lines were now leaking at the radiator connection. (not installed correctly.) When mechanic installed the correct coolant, he mixed it himself with 50% tap water. Now I need to flush the sytem myself, and install a premixed 50/50 dexcool mixture of coolant, or risk engine damage. \n The managers are friendly and seem to care, but the mechanics are total morons and a$$ clowns. I complained to customer service, and a diistrict manager ordered the manager to refund the total repair, and buy me a new plastic air filter clamp. I still had to take my car to another shop to repair the transmission cooler connectors, and properly check the transmission fluid. (complicated procedure on corvette involving car on lift, engine running, and removing drain plug, and injecting fluid with hand pump.) I would not trust firestone mechanics to work on my lawnmower, let alone my corvette. take my advice, and stay away from these idiots, if you want youre car fixed right. Sure the managers are friendly, but the mechanics are worthless. \n  This shop has only recently opened. Makes me wonder how these guys lost their last jobs, before they came to firestone. I wonder how many customer cars they screwed up at last job to get fired, then go to firestone."
1,"was recommended by a girlfriend whose nails looked amazing.  Mike did a great job with my specifications.. they are perfect.. acrylic is thin and narrow... the polish job is fab.  he made sure i was entirely dry before i left.  and they removed old acrylic, gave me a full set for 30.  very reasonable.  i will def. be back.  ps.  i heard his wife cindy is great also.  but i would make an appt."
1,This was our first time here and we would definitely come back again. We had great service from the friendly staff and our sandwiches were really tasty too :)
0,Hopefully this place is better a night . . . but we were here during the late morning . . . and did we get looked at very strangely by the regulars all sitting at the bar . . . it was full by the way . . . and it was kinda creepy.  Thought if we found two seats at the bar . . . we would get people telling us to get out of Betsy's and Carl's seats or something.\n\nThe set-up looked pretty good for a local band to play and would probably be good for that . . . problem is . . . when I am in Las Vegas . . . I spend evening at the hotel and casino I am staying at.\n\nBottom line . . . I probably won't be back . . .
0,Great happy hour deals - horrible bartenders - they look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers like it
1,"I come to Home Depot all the time for stuff. I'm constantly coming here for all my home garden needs.  My house and yard are rather large and I'm the do it yourself type of girl.  I tried to find the same garden items at lowe's and target but as far as gardening supplies goes, Home Depot has got them beat.  Due to the large size of my yard I dot just need supplies, I need them in bulk or large containers to save money and I was able to find that here.\n\nI've always had good customer service and I've always been able to find what I need."
1,very good..   huge plates!!
0,"If I had the chance, I would give them no stars. We were trying to get a table cause I really wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate. After waiting around for about 30-45 minutes, the hostess rudely told us that we were standing in the way and we had to move. First, she could have said that a little nicer. And second, if they had adequate amount of space there would be no issue. Due to her poor behavior, we decided to leave without even trying this place."
1,"Hidden a bit, but worth the search.  Breakfast was very good, fast, and fresh.  We had the California Club and Breakfast Burrito (w/ chicken sausage) - 2 thumbs up for both.  We'll be back."
1,"Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered \""fresh\"" which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.\n\nMy husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  \n\nWe'll return."
0,Now that their new inspection results have been published I understand why I get sick all the time.\n\nI'm going to avoid this place like the plague.
1,"Stealth business. Run like it's in the witness protection program but has really good pizza\n\nI found this place on Yelp and was intrigued by the idea of getting some real New York-style pizza during a trip to Charlotte. \n\nWhen I dug a little deeper to try to find a website with a menu, or any other sign this business actually existed, I came up almost empty. At one point I thought \""I have it\"" but then noticed the web site I found listed 4 locations -- in Fresno!\n\nI finally just called the place using the number in Yelp and somewhat to my surprise, they actually existed. I ordered a \""small\"" pizza and set out in my car to pick it up. \n\nAs previously described, the \""small\"" pizza would feed a \""small\"" mob. I mentioned to the manager that I had a hard time finding the place on the web, and he replied \""yeah - someday the owner might put up a web site...\""\n\nHe also told me that they had another location next to the WalMart on North Tryon Street, which was literally 6 blocks from where I started out. \n\nIn any case, the pizza was: huge, tasty and with a true New York style crust. Excellent!\nWorth the hassle, but it sure could have been easier."
0,I really don't like giving bad reviews and I've had my fair share of delicious and really bad tasting pho. Today I came here with my family and ordered a pho chin (brisket) and my mom got the seafood pho... my goodness I might as well have gotten noodles in a bowl of plain water. The broth was disappointingly bland even with sriracha and hoysen sauce... we seriously had to reach for the salt. The noodles were kinds hard... Maybe it was an off day for them but I probably won't be back
0,"I really wanted more for a $60 meal.  The restaurant is beautiful but you expect that in the nice hotels in Vegas.  Service was also nice and very attentive.  The mixed drinks were pretty tasty also.\n\nNow to the main purpose of a restaurant...the food.  Blah!  The French Onion Soup had so much cheese and almost no onion.  I don't think I can  express how much cheese....soooo much.  Too much.  For my entree, I had the seared sea scallops with whipped cauliflower and spinach.  The scallops were still raw and cold in the center and although there was a nice sear on them, the outside was cold too.  The cauliflower was more runny than whipped and the spinach was just okay.\n\nI gave up at dessert. Friends who did have dessert said it was good but nothing they couldn't have had somewhere else, cheaper."
0,"Went there after hearing about the Arizona Cardinals promotion, if the Cards won, you get a free medium coffee the day after the game.  Well, I went, didn't know about the app for the smart phone.  Was told that I need the app and the phone wasn't with me.   Didn't get the coffee, walked away unhappy."
1,i stayed here last year for edc and this year too..woo edc!!! butt we ended up staying here both years it was great the lady at the front desk was very friendly and fast. she got us all set up and even gave us complimentary drinks and two night stay for september.. also the prices are unbeatable.. go check it out theyre slots are looser than others as well :)

0,Tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency.  fail.
0,"Ugh.  Just no.  Why?  It takes forever to get in.  It's complete anarchy trying to get in, even when your name is ON the list.  The music is boring and repeated often.  The drinks are small and expensive.  The crowd is, um, less than savory.  The floor is wet...all the time.  And a trip to the bathrooms requires a sherpa guide.  \n\nStick to the deli outside Pure.  The drinks and service are better and you get to hear the music from the Pussycat slots nearby.\n\nMy parting memory of Pure was walking outside alongside some Guidettes who had taken off their shoes and could barely stand.  One of them started ralphing on the sidewalk outside Ceaser's while the other girl held her hair.  Classy!"
0,"The quality of the cleaning is good, but we have had issues with service/misplacement of items. On one occasion, they lost my husband's pants. They eventually gave us a replacement check, but it took several times of back and forth communication in order this issue to be resolved. I'm sure that had I not been persistent, nothing would have been done.\n\nOn another occasion, I realized that one of my favorite blouses was no longer in my closet. Initially, the person who worked there (someone who I didn't see very often) said she didn't know what to do and that it wasn't in their \""left over\"" area. I was super frustrated, and she just didn't have to skills to deal with the situation. Against my better judgment, I returned the following week with more dry cleaning. The girl who is usually there recognized me and took my order. I then asked her about the blouse. She exclaimed that they had the blouse and that, somehow, it had gotten separated from the rest of the order. \n\nOn yet another occasion, I picked up the regular order, and the attendant grabbed a shirt separate from the order and added it to my pick-up. Yes, another instance of a shirt getting separated, and no one tells me!\n\nToday was the last straw-we had received an email for a double-coupon promotion. The regular attendant said I had come in a day early for the promotion, but that she will submit the order the following day, along with the promo code. I picked up the order this afternoon, and I just had a hunch that I should check if the promo code was applied. Another new attendant was there, and he pretty much said he didn't know what to do and that he was new there. No, \""Let me take down your info and get it to someone.\"" Nothing. No remorse. No concern that the order wasn't entered correctly. \n\nAgain, quality was fine. But the customer service is horrendous. Only one person seems adequately trained to handle any issues. I am now in search for a new, reasonably-priced and professional dry cleaners."
0,"Below average in more than one category.\nMassive steak portions. As one example the prime rib I believe is 34 oz, but you can't get a smaller size.  Another example is the 26 oz. ribeye.  It's kind of a \""Heart Attack Grill\"" methodology for the portion sizes, except the HAG has beef that is really flavorful, unlike this place!  I ended up getting the 8 oz petite filet since I didn't want to gorge.....cooked exactly as I asked, but nothing remarkable to write home about.\nAs an appetizer, I had the French onion soup.  There was some annoying sweet taste in the soup, which overwhelmed  any other flavor.  The cheese topping the soup was tasteless.  My friend had the colossal shrimp cocktail, and it was massive....only 2 shrimp, and at least the presentation gets an A+.  For $27, I would expect a lot from a shrimp cocktail!\nFor prices, I believe the petite filet was $52, beers were $12, horseradish sauce $5, and the French onion soup was $14.....with the Total Rewards card discount.\n\nService was very good, but you won't feel pampered here.\n\nOh Caesars, why did you ever replace Neros Steakhouse with this place?"
0,"Heard great things about this place, but it was a disappointment. The decor is great, but our service was terrible. Food was brought out at different times and it took a long time to get our waters too. My lasagna was a little bland. The best thing I ordered was the house red, and even that was just okay."
0,"Another place where 0 stars would be appropriate. Came in at about 12:30 with a medium  size group (8 people maybe?). We placed the other, it took them more than 25 min to bring it out (and that would be fine). A few of us got the eggplant sandwich, which turns out is pre-made (seriously? the food carts out there manage to make sandwiches on the spot!). The bread was so soggy I had to leave it (which for anyone who knows me, this is very rare). The fries were cold and greasy. I would have gotten better food at a gas station (and I would have not paid 12 bucks for it). Horrible, horrible. And the tip was included in the bill, so I could not even express my dissatisfaction."
0,"Poorly organized lines, \""free\"" drink with an outlandish cover charge, and crowded. No room to dance, and tge music they pump out at the entrance is fun top 40 dance, while inside it is aggressive hip hop. Nicest part of the club are the escalators going up."
0,"This review is from August but it looks like nothing has really changed.\n\nFirst of all, friend bought a Groupon for $40 each all you can drink wells. They only had a specific list of drinks you could get. The bartender could only make one of them right. We even told him about it and he kept making them wrong. The place is super small and the floors are so sticky you can't even walk right. It also smelled like farts and poop. The DJ sucked; it took him way too long to transition to the next song. The only positive? The other bartender was able to make a screwdriver the right way. Definitely not worth it!!!!"
1,"Great pizza and friendly service.  The place is plenty big, so it doesn't get too loud."
1,"Ein uriger Pub mit einer Riesenauswahl an Whiskies (ca 200 offene Flaschen). Es gibt unter anderem traditionelles schottisches Essen und die M\u00f6glichkeit, unterschiedliche \""Whisky-Men\u00fcs\"" zu ordern. Die Bedienungen sind sehr freundlich. Neben Single Malt gibt es auch eine recht gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Bieren. Klare Empfehlung, ein Muss f\u00fcr jeden Whisky-Liebhaber"
1,"I work very close to this place, so when the name popped up I was instantly intrigued. Not to mention the fact that they only serve huge hot pockets. Double the interest. I walked in to a cute waitress with a smile and hot red hair, sold before I tasted the food! Now this better be good! \nI have never dined in, and my review is based on 2 Togo orders. One for lunch at work, and one I brought home for dinner.\nTrip number one I ordered the Cottage pie, and my boss tried to vegan rosemary chicken. Also got the chips with jalapeno and garlic. Chips are fries, and would be better dining in. Good, just got a bit mushy. Pasties were to die for. Flaky crust that didn't get soggy. Stuffed so full of goodness. Depending on what your pasty choice is you receive a side of gravy, marinara, ketchup, or whatever may go good with yours! \nMy second trip we ordered Cajun chicken, meat and cheese, and the pastrami. Everyone was happy and would order theirs again. The garlic mashed potato side is FULL of garlic and I was a huge fan of the baked cauliflower and broccoli. Crust was perfect. \nI have yet to try their desserts, but I have a feeling when I do- my rating will go to 5 stars. \nDon't let the yuck location scare you off, this place is a hidden gem!"
1,decent education at a decent price!
0,Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice?
0,"This mall is located near my office and sometimes I head here to do a little shopping on my lunch break or right after work. I always end up spending way more money than I intend to here because I tend to duck into stores when I hear escalated yelling between two groups of obnoxious future GED recipients. This happens a lot.\n\nPros: Forever 21 (closest besides it is AZ mills), Macys, Victoria's Secret.\nCons: Chick Fil-A closed, Unusually high risk of filling out some sort of police report."
1,"We have been coming to the Veggie House for a while now and we love it. The decor is very nice and the ladies that work there remember us and always have suggestions as what to try. They remember that we always get tea and rice and what we chatted back the visit before. You feel like family when you go there even if you come with a big group. I'm a very boring, picky eater, but I'll try everything the veggie house has to offer it's that good!"
0,"As we had done in previous years following a Steelers game, we came to this place as it was conveniently located from our hotel, the Sheraton Station Square. The eight of us sat in a booth that had a few dishes remaining from the previous customers. Around 15 minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes. Finally a young girl came to take our order. She apologized and cleaned off our table.\n\nWe ordered and then waited at least 30 minutes. A girl from our group went to question what was going on. Eventually the manager came out, apologized and said the food would be out in 3 minutes. At least 10 minutes passed. We questioned him again this time verbally expressing our irritation. He mentioned he fired 4 workers and took the blame. Regardless, we were all disgruntled.\n\nThen several minutes later the waitress came out and said she did not have any avocado and another ingredient and a few of our dishes could not be made. This was something they could have told us before we ordered and had to wait 40 or so minutes. One of the dishes that was supposed to have bacon came with baco bits instead. \n\nThe manager agreed to not bill us for the few items we received and with that we got up and left.\n\nWhile I do give credit to the manager and particularly to the young girl who was apologetic and did her best despite the circumstances, I find this kind of service unacceptable. This place is clearly mismanaged and this level of service has convinced me to never ever come to this bar again.\n\nIn order for this or any establishment to retain customers, it is important that they are fully prepared to service customers and if they are not then they at least communicate that to us early on so that our time is not wasted."
0,"At first, I thought I got unlucky with a bad waiter or off day.  I even thought he could tell I had comp credits and assumed i would stiff him on the tip. However based on the other reviews I'm reading, poor service is apparently the norm here.  \n\nIt wasn't rude, just slow and inept. A side order was forgotten, a small and very simple request was ignored, and our waiter seemed to be hating life in general. The only saving grace was the lady who refilled drinks and hustling all over the place.\n\nThe food itself? Not bad, but I wouldn't return.  There's a various selection of burgers, but the selection pales to competitors like burger bar, strip burger, etc.  I felt like the fries and the kaiser bun were the best part of my meal.\n\nNote to management: try hiring some people that don't have a look of pure contempt on their faces as they are doing their job. Or at least people who can fake it.  Hard to fathom coming here ever again , unless it was past midnight - they're advertising a $1 burger/fries between 12am-6am!"
0,"I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though."
0,"I will NEVER eat there again as long as their tyrant general manager Todd is in charge. His treatment of the servers was hard to watch. He is a bully and he frankly turned my stomach. I am going to write a well worded letter to the corporate, no one deserves that kind of treatment."
1,"So cool to get to grab two seats at the bar here! We LOVED the Pepperoni Pretzel Sticks with Cheese! But the Macornoni burger to split as a follow up was too much food, yet delicious! The Blackberry Marg was way too sweet for me, if you like traditional cocktails go for the Bloody Mary here... it has an entire array of spicy vegetables and fruits attached... SO GOOD! Great beer selection as well. Worth a stop in Vegas for the prices people, you should probably make a plan to stop by and be ready to wait for a table or get aggressive at the bar :)"
1,Great place to sell back items and buy used books/comics/magazine/music!
0,"This place is disgusting. It's dirty. The food is greasy, and the staff is quite sleazy."
1,"I was fortunate enough to be in Vegas during the opening of The Cromwell. Since I was staying next door at The Flamingo, I decided to give it a try. I have no idea what the rooms are like, and I didn't venture into Giada's restaurant, but I did blow some cash at the casino.\n\nUpon entering the casino, I was impressed by the stylish retro decor that includes lots of stained wood and brass, gorgeous chandeliers, and cool lighting! It felt like I stepped back in time to a smaller casino that isn't full of loud obnoxious college kids. I really enjoyed losing money at this cozy casino, and the cocktail waitresses are very attentive.\n\nAlso cool is the retro gift shop that offers many cool and affordable items. There's even an area dedicated to old-school Great Britain! The gift shop employee was very friendly and helpful, and we purchased a few items to take home (which is rare for us because most Vegas gift shops are a ripoff!).\n\nI would be willing to stay at The Cromwell the next time I visit Las Vegas. If not, I'll surely come back to gamble and try Giada's restaurant."
0,"I try to not review in fits of anger but, I am so pissed!  Took a group of four here after a movie and it was a disaster!  Unfortunately, no amount of beer can ever make up for such a crappy dining experience.  Waiter kept touching all of us in that overly friendly/concerned relative sort of way.  Food not cooked properly.  Food dropped by wait staff.  Manager bait and switch.  Not fixing the bill.  So bad I considered a dine and dash.  Decided to bitch to corporate and cancel my card transaction instead.  Beware, chains don't give a crap about the customer!  I will remember to spend my money at small private restaurants with good health ratings.\n\n...By way of follow up.  Corporate did contact me.  Through Yelp only as their complaint section of their website does not work.  Good luck if you have a bad experience there.\n-------\nJune 17th follow up:  Decided to finally give them a second try.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  The experience may have actually been worse.  Just skip this place and go spend your money at one of the 10 other places nearby.  Big deal they have the hockey game on.  Bet that if you asked the bartender at Gordon Biersch to change the channel the would.  Also, at least they know what is going on over there."
1,"Our driver was excellent and especially helpful to an elderly lady who was returning to Mesa, AZ for the winter. He carried her bags to her front door and helped her with a cranky front door lock. He was very kind to her."
1,"I've been going there for awhile now, and it is under a new manegment and it is awesome. All associates that I had an interaction with have been amazing, and they know what they're doing,  the facility is very clean and organized, definitely make sure to ask for Lucy, she rocks, very professional and makes you feel very comfortable. Over all just amazing."
0,I went here for a mani and pedi and did not have a good experience. First the guy didn't listen to me and put gels on my toes after I told him I didn't want gels. (BTW they didn't take it off the bill) then I got my manicure and looked at it later and it was the WORST manicure I've ever gotten. I had to go back to get it fixed (only reason they got a 2) and the girl was so rough when she was taking off the old polish that she ripped my cuticle and now I have to wear a bandaid on two of my fingers. \n\nNever going back and I don't recommend this place.
0,"I went to Los Tacos Saturday 4/23/11. I didn't eat the food because I was SO upset by the bill I had to get a refund and leave. They do nickel and dime on everything. 75cents for a glass of tap water! Sour cream, cheese, avocado. The up charges where $8 on a $20 bill. Long story short I did get my money back and went to macayos across the street. Macayos was a little more $2.00 but I got fajita instead of a burrito."
0,Watch out for the stupid redhead at the bar. Has no manners and respect. Kicked and told on us like a little girl for waiting at the bar since it was full. I want to punch him in the face and take his tip jar next time. Anyways beside him it's an alright place.
0,This place kind of sucks. The waitress was super nice but the food is awful and the drinks are very overpriced. I'm happy we went because I was always curious about the place but we definitely won't be returning.
0,"Typically I don't write bad reviews but the last time I went to this restaurant, during happy hour on a Friday they royally overcharged me for my appetizers and drinks.  I didn't pay much attention at first but then did a more thorough review of my receipt and was appalled by what I found.  Upon speaking the restaurant they didn't care.  Considering it was happy hour prices and I walked out spending over $60; let's just say I won't be back or recommending this place to anyone.  I would also encourage anyone who reads this to stay away, you are likely to face the same issues with their creative billing that I did."
1,"Maybe I'm easily pleased, but I love this store.  From the Starbucks, to the sandwich counter, to the bakery, to the vast array of gift cards I can give for birthday's/anniversary's, because I don't have much of an imagination.\n\nI love their Eating Right line of frozen foods, and the produce is pretty good.\n\nToo bad I moved too far away to make this a regular stop."
0,"I was driving through and decided to spend a night here. The rooms are ok, yet the casino is a total scam. Homeless people roaming around with plastic bags, just waiting to jack your phone or wallet. Dealers allowing complete scams at their tables, barely speaking english, and not being able to count the chips (requiring managers assistance). Never coming back here again."
1,"Ahh yes, the Cabana Suites. Pretty awesome room, I loved the decor. Honestly, I picked this place just for the room decor ;) You don't really spend much time in hotel rooms in Vegas anyway!\n\nIt was a little off Fremont St, which was nice so we didn't have to listen to white trash drunkards all night. It was right across the street from the El Cortez where we like to gamble, so that made it central for us.\n\nThe front desk person was friendly yet quiet and the security guard that stood at the front of the building was always friendly. \n\nNot really any qualms about this place at all. Don't know that I'd stay here again just because I have vowed to avoid Fremont St any time I'm in Vegas now.. it's changed.."
1,"I went with a group of friends and we had a lot of fun. I enjoyed all the things I could do, especially the laser maze, the 3-d shooting and the motion-effects theatre. I would compare this more to an interactive museum experience rather than a disneyland-esque experience, so just go with that frame of mind when going."
1,"Flawless check-in: Front desk staff greeted me promptly, told me my room was ready and I was given vouchers for breakfast, welcome letters from the manager, and directions with a little map on how to navigate the grounds.  I had also forgotten my phone charger at home, so I got directions to the closest Verizon store (but not before the concierge checked to see if he had an extra charger in the stash of chargers people left behind in their hotel rooms).\n\nThe common courtyard/garden is spectacular- there are tables & chairs that surround one side, fire pits at night, adirondack chairs on the edges, all overlooking a showcase water fountain, grass, palm trees & flowers.  Great landscaping!  There are also little nooks between hotel & villa/cottage buildings- I stumbled across a giant lawn chess set as I was trying to get to the parking lot one day- very cool.  Room service rides around the property on big tricycles- very cool.  When I was here, there were lots of families and older folks- there was a golf tournament & Passover event so I'm guessing those are the drivers of the weekend demographics.\n\nHotel room was very standard and almost a disappointment if I didn't read it already in the other Yelp reviews.  I got a good deal too so I wasn't too bummed...just know that the rooms are a little dated and don't really match the Wright style of design that dominates the exterior and the common areas.  The A/C is also very loud- I ran it during the day while I wasn't in the room and turned it off at night so I could sleep in peace.  Bed is alright- mattress is a little too springy for me, has a cushy feather bed on top and a good amount of pillows- but Westin bed it ain't.  On my last night, there was a giant and bright full moon, which I enjoyed by opening my curtains and letting the moonlight shine into my room.  There are quite a few options in different price ranges- the cottages look fun and have patios where you can sit outside...I'm guessing those cost quite a bit more.\n\nHuge con- parking.  Valet costs $20+ a night, and Self Parking is $12...there's definitely not enough space for self parking so you're left to stalk guests who are leaving, or suck it up and park in the valet.  It's also quite a trek if you end up parking at the far end of the lot...I didn't mind since I could use the exercise, but if you have luggage or can't walk that far, be prepared to valet or be dropped off at the front entrance.  \n\nAnother con that I ended up being happy about- their spa was completely booked for Spa Week and they couldn't possibly fit in another treatment, even for a paying guest like myself.  It ended up OK, b/c I spent the day at another resort and spa, which i liked even better.  I took a stroll though the spa area- it was attached to the main pool area which was very loud, and didn't seem as lush or pleasant as the spa I ended up going to.  The pool areas get very full- try checking out the multiple pools they have on property to see which best fits your style.  Cheap thin small pool towels too- you'll need at least 2 to cover your chair.\n\nReally convenient- near Biltmore Fashion Park for shopping & restaurants, and not far from the highway and airport.  \n\nAll in all, it was a nice place to stay with beautiful ground and great service- I'll probably go check out another hotel the next time I'm in town, but if I find an incredible deal to the AZ Biltmore, I wouldn't hesitate to take advantage."
1,"I am in love with this place!\n\nFor such a little place, who would of think it would be so much fun!\n\nEvery time we go, we have a blast. \n\nThey have great selection of wine and beer. Did I mention a great selection of grilled cheeses that they have? They are absolutely delish. Order up people. \n\nThe atmosphere is always awesome. People that work there are extremely friendly and have great knowledge of their products. You are never ignored at this place. Even if you went all by yourself, you would feel like you are in a company of so many friends!\n\nThey have several fun games all around so you are never bored at this place. Also, take an advantage of chalk wall and leave your prints. \n\nI forgot to mention that this place has been most yelped place in the entire USA! Yes, entire USA. You must check it out and believe me, you will not regret it!"
0,"for one of our bachelorette festivities we ate at fix restaurant & bar in the bellagio.  we had a fixed menu which consisted of kobe sliders with fries, ceasar salad, yellowtail sashimi and spicy tuna appetizers. strange mix of appetizers you say?  well, as the meal went on, the combo got weirder.  for the main entrees, we had a choice of roasted chicken and mash potatoes, sea bass over risotto or penne pasta with prosciutto.  during our main entree, the waiter brings over a plate of large fried squares that looked like large fries.  turns out they were fried mac & cheese sticks!  omg!  where did that come from?!  and for dessert: donuts with chocolate and peanut butter sauces for dipping.  so the yellowtail sashimi and spicy tuna were really good, probably the best things on our fixed menu that night.  the penne pasta was also surprisingly delicious and although the sea bass tasted ok, they had put some tomato paste on top of it which was weird - it was as if they had run out of ways to make it taste good so they slapped on some tomato paste.  the donuts turned out good but the chocolate sauce tasted salty and the peanut sauce was like eating dry roasted peanuts.  not creamy and rich like you'd think it would be.  this was the strangest combo of food i'd ever seen.  it was like they gave the menu to a kid and asked him what he wanted to eat that night and they slapped it all together.  the combination of all these foods gave some people stomach aches and i think the people who ate the sea bass got the worst belly aches b/c none of us felt right the next day!  if you're going to put a fixed menu together at least match up the foods better so they blend well with each other.  don't spin the roulette wheel!"
1,"It takes only one word to review this place... \""MMMMMMMMMMM.\""\n\nAs far as Texas style BBQ in the valley goes, Joe's is the best that I have had out here.  I'm a big fan of the brisket!  \n\nThe inside decor is what truly makes this place awesome though.  From what Joe says, the place used to be a church that he bought and converted.  Everything inside the place is a visual treat, including an actual tractor and a building inside of the building (where you can sit and eat in a little more privacy)."
0,"I just called to ask for an estimate of price and had the poorest customer service in my life. Even if you don't know exactly what needs to be done you can explain the differences in cost over the phone. James was extremely rude and kept cutting me off before I could finish a sentence!!!!\n\nI have never in my life been treated that way by an establishment over the phone. At no point did I raise my voice or ask anything inappropriate. James himself got flustered and hung up the phone. A man like that who claims to give excellent customer service should not be in business. \n\nI come from the service industry and definitely know what it means to respect your customers. I would never ever in my entire life talk to someone like that. \n\nBy the way, called many other alterations shops and they were all happy and willing to give me an idea of the cost. \n\nPlease do not go here. Ever. It may be more affordable but you get what you pay for."
1,"O is all the things you love about the Olympics rolled into 1 show: Diving & gymnatics. And if syncronized swimming and clown acts are your faves, well, added bonus.\n\nDo yourself a favor and read the website or wikipedia about the show. Almost everyone in my party was confused about what the hell was going on. There's a back story, but not.\n\nHave ADHD? This show is for you! There are sooooooooooooo many things going on at the same time - I wasn't sure where to focus my attention!\n\nThe auditorium is supposed to be a sort-of replica of an ancient theater. Unfortunately, if you're in the 300 section, row 2 and above, you miss some of the show. The clowns do something down below, I could only see a bit of it without risking falling to my death. Good thing I hate clowns!"
1,"Finally got to eat brunch at the Morning Glory cafe and it was fantastic! The only downside was the cost of Bloody Mary's...$9??? That's steep. For this time of year, the setting and the weather definitely enhance the dining experience. Our waiter/host was fantastic, especially when he offered my friend a great-smelling rose. I wish I had more opportunities to make this my weekly brunch spot."
0,This is the most disorganized Walmart that I have been to I purchased two TVs on Thanksgiving night for the one hour guarantee in because of their mistake it's been over a month and I still haven't received my TVs. This is BS and I'm stuck here cause I don't know what else I can do.
1,"Our eyes couldn't focus quick enough, coming in from the bright Las Vegas sun, into this extremely dark and cool (as in vibe and temp) dive bar off the beaten path, miles off the strip.\n\n38 Special's \""Hold on Loosely\"" was  jamming from the jukebox, locals were seated at the bar and our eyes focused just enough to see the \""Please Seat Yourself\"" sign. We carefully made our way past the 70's-style booths and found a cozy two top.\n\nBefore we could sit, a voice echoed from the darkness, I'll be right there. That gave us time to awkwardly gawk and gaze around like the tourist we were. This could be a seedy local refuge for undesirables or one of the best kept secrets in Vegas. We soon found it to be the later.\n\nOur server Nicole came over, bubbly as gas in a hot tub, decorated with a bright smile and oozing with local charm. We felt welcomed, comfortable and wanted to know more. She dropped off two glasses and a bottle of water, no...not Fiji, or Evan...a bottle...with a cork...that had water in it. The bottle may have come from Al Capone's vault. Classic. (and no tad poles).\n\nShe gave us the back story of the joint, ex MGM chef from Buffalo cranking out authentic buffalo-style and east coast cuisine with some of the smartest pizza combinations on the planet. Of course we were there for one thing...the Suicide Fries.\n\nHer face lit up, \""I love those, we now bottle the Suicide Sauce.\""  She explained the complex mixture of hot, hotter and hottest all brought together over a plate of fries. We were sold. She also suggested a great local brown ale (maybe from Sin City Brewery, but wasn't sure). The beer and the spicy fries were just what we needed. We were in heaven. The plate had spice, but more importantly, flavor. \n\nEvery bite made you want to have another. I worked up quite a sweat and was thankful for the cutlery...you don't want these spices resonating and breeding on your phalanges all day, then touching an unsuspected body part later...\n\nWe will definitely be back to try some of the other great sounding items on the menu, enjoy the friendly service and just to see if we can recognize any of America's Most Wanted sitting at the bar."
1,"Was so cute! A hidden gem :) In an old house lies this restaurant covered by a huge beautiful pine tree. We had the house brisket and biscuit on a food tour last night. Sat outside under the tree. Started with a glass of prosecco. Kind of reminded me of restaurants in Napa, local fresh food. Laid back atmosphere like a summer day on the back porch. 4 stars because we didn't try everything and well...After looking at the menu it is a bit expensive. Definitely will be back for a romantic date night though!! They need a happy hour to be a bit more affordable."
0,so I took my dog here 2 or 3 times for lumps that showed up on her because it was close to me and and they got good reviews however they were horrible they talked surgery to remove and even did a syringe to drain one and said that it wasn't infected with puss or anything just clear liquid and blood put her on a antibiotic and said well her white blood cell count is elevated but probably do to this lump then went back again for more lumps and they talked about surgery and removing them without doing any blood work oh and giving me shit about not fixing her long story short took her to s different vet and was diagnosed with valley fever now why would a vet not test for this right away since were in az and i even thought valley fever i had a friend that got nochels from it so if i had not taken her here i could have started treatment a lot sooner i would go somewhere else doctor ford at arizona animal wellness is great
0,"I have been here a couple of times because it's convenient to the surrounding restaurants in the same complex that do not have boba. Sadly every time I have received next to no service. Once we even waited 45 mins to pay for our bill.\n\nThe drinks themselves are decent but a little too sweet. The milk teas and teas (in which I usually get) isn't too bad. They do have a really large menu with tons of variety on both drinks and appetizers.\n\nIf you do plan to visit this establishment, expect to see your waitress when you take your order, when they give you your drinks, and maybe when they come to pick up the $$ for your bill. More than once I had to literally walk up to the register to pay for our tab since they were taking really long."

0,"Monte Carlo, why did I choose to stay here?  Must be that it is located right in the middle of the strip, next to Aria and the City Center.  This used to be my wife's favorite hotel in Las Vegas.  Don't ask me why because I honestly don't know.  With many newer and older but better establishments on the strip, there's really no reason to choose Monte Carlo unless you already knew that...\n\nthe POOL has a lazy river!  It's not as long as the ones you might find at MGM, but it is sufficient enough to relax and take a moment away from the busy casino noise.  You can also rental a tube as floating device at the service counter.  But really, that's all the highlights of this hotel, unless you enjoy...\n\nCHEAP FOOD COURT adjacent to the main elevators.  If I remember correctly, they have Starbucks, McDonald's, Manchu Wok, Rubio's, and Subway.  These are some of the choices that you might not find in other hotels on the strip.  Of course, if you want to drop a few hundred dollars, you can do at the casino, unless you knew to...\n\ngo to ANDRE'S, the fine dinning restaurant of Monte Carlo.  I have not personally tried it, but according to fellow yelpers, it's a traditional french restaurant that's hidden away inside the casino.  When food coma hits, you might just want to passed out anywhere on the casino floor, unless you already have a...\n\nROOM at the Monte Carlo, which is nothing spectacular, nothing more a than regular hotel room with regular beds, chairs, and bathroom.  Very regular, but adequate for your nap until the thin walls allow you to hear everything your neighbors do.  That's when you ask yourself, why did I choose...\n\nMonte Carlo.  Must be its centralized location on the strip."
1,"\""Gross.. someone bit mine.\""   Don't despair, it's their trademark.  \n\nA fantastic place to pick up a nice dessert while you people watch or window shop out and about Tempe.  Its at the center Mill's, so it's the ideal local to pick up a treat and wander.\n\nIf you don't like tart, stay away from anything raspberry related.  My favorite is the rich and creamy arroz con leche.  Stop by when it's triple digits or need a free pass to visit Mills."
0,i have been at pawsh before and was satisfied with the grooming my dog got.  i went back again for the third time but this time it was a total disaster.  when i brought the dog in i told this hillbilly that was behind the counter which i think is the owner not to cut the dogs belly more then 1/2 in. because the dogs belly is very sensitive  when i got there to pick up the dog i noticed that her belly was shaved and bleeding and her lip was cut. needless to say i am not coming back to this place in my lifetime . as i was checking out this woman asked me if i wanted to give her a tip  ( unbelievable )
1,"We used to go here all the time as a gang of ravenous undergraduates because BYO and a huge inexpensive mound of pasta within walking distance of your tiny crowded apartment just makes sense at that age. I hadn't been back in a while but Matt and Cindy's recent UYE (unofficial yelp event) brought me back and made me realize that inexpensive mounds of good food at a BYO never stops being a good idea, and is especially wise on Mondays. \n\nI ordered the Surf and Turf because at $24 this has to be one of the cheapest quality deals for steak, shrimp and pasta in town. The pasta was fresh and the sauce pure cream and butter goodness. The shrimp were really good, not fishy at all, and the steak was kind of amazing, super tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare in a light wine gravy.\n\nAll in all a very satisfying yummy meal made better by the vines and stained glass and the exceptionally adorable company."
1,"Best steak place in Charlotte, hands down.. service is excellent. .. can be pricey.. Try the VIP drink and the Long bone steak."
0,"I took my husband here for his 35th Birthday. We ordered Calamari for an appetizer we were completely disappointed, it was rubbery and the sauce was overpowering with sweetness and made everything mushy. It was obviously frozen. Their Ginger Alcoholic beverage was disgusting, too much ginger. One thing I can positively say is that the Prime Rib was out of this world!!! I highly recommend the Prime Rib to anyone who's looking for a good quality dinner!"
1,"Came with Yelper Scott W. for lunch since he was in town. \n\nI haven't been here in years. There's other Thai in the area I usually hit up and if I want to eat at TSNH, there are other locations closer to home. It seemed they painted and it looks cleaner in here than what I remember. \n\nWe started with a appetizer of potstickers. It's standard potstickers, but good. They do a trio of sauces swirled on it, not the typical soy based sauce. \n\nI got a rice plate of spicy thai basil with pork at a 6 level which wasn't that spicy so I doused it with hot sauce. I like my spicy, Thai level spicy and since I haven't been here in a while, I wanted to go middle of the road to gauge it. Still the flavor of it was good though.\n\nScott got red curry I believe with chicken and I took a bite and it was rather good. It was oddly more spicy than mine even though he got less spice level.\n\nService was decent enough. My water was refilled which is appreciated in this crazy heatwave. \n\nFor a appetizer, 2 entrees and a drink for $22, this is some cheap eats. Definitely the prices are great since most is about $7. I don't think the quality suffers from it either as both entrees had food flavor and a decent amount of food."
0,"This place has a complex about what ethnicity is it. Plaid skirts are Scottish, food from the U.K. only includes Northern Ireland, and the boxty this place served me came in a potato tortilla. Really. just like at the Old Town Tortilla Factory. For the record, boxty isn't entirely irish. In fact with the exception of a burger and mash potatoes, nothing on this menu would appear on a menu in ireland, not even at the airport. \nand even if boxty was a reguarly served food there, its always done poperly by shredding potatoes. Thats in fact the only part of the dish that makes it the dish. That aside, even what what in our \""boxty\"" was gross. I didn't expect a lot, but this place dissapoints."
0,"DO NOT GO THERE. I lost 6 inches of my hair because of this place!! I went there for the first time and had my hair done with Tee. I asked for an ombre with darker roots (my hair is dark brown) and I already had highlights on. I spent 4 hours there and my hair came out ORANGE with red roots! I looked absolutely awful and it wasn't anything close to what I asked for. I went back an hour later and asked them to fix my hair. Spent more 4 hours at the salon and left looking even worse. My hair started to fall out while I was at the salon and they did absolutely nothing! I left there with my hair falling out and looking absolutely terrible. They literally cooked my hair, and I lost 6 inches of it! I went to a different place on the next day and all the hairstylists were terrified with what happened to my hair and said they had never seen worse job in their lives. It was all damaged and the color was so ugly. I had 6 inches of my hair cut off and I used to have really long, pretty hair. Now my hair is half of its old length because of Mark and Anthony Salon. Not only that, but when I called they said it would cost $60, I ended up paying $150! I asked for a refund and they gave it to me right away, but they can never give me my hair back or all the money I had to spend at the new salon and with all the products I have to use it now to fix what they did. It's going to take about an year for my hair to grow out and not to be damaged anymore. I've never regretted something as much as going to that place. By any means, do not go there if you care about your hair. Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,"XS is the best!\n\nXS, Thryst, The Bank, Foundation Room  and TAO are the best club in Vegas. The rest is crap.\n\nGreat music and not to loud. Next to the XS pool.\n\nPretty awesome place. A very classy place."

The delivery guy apparently didn't know the area at all. Instead of traveling to my office on the University of Illinois campus, he ended up traveling to ANOTHER CITY. When he called and asked me for the cross streets, I gave them to him. And then the kicker, he BLAMED ME for getting to the wrong address!\n\nSo he finally arrived at the right place, AND HE DIDN'T HAVE CHANGE!!!\n\nI said that I only wanted to tip him $2 but he recommendend that I give him the whole $20 bill. I was so pissed and hungry that I gave him the bill. I doubt you're reading this delivery guy because you couldn't even frikkin go on Mapquest to get the right directions... but I hope you figure things out.\n\nI ate my empanada cold = not cool :("
1,"The best nightclub I've been to in Vegas. It's a must go! They really put forth a lot of effort with the lasers and everything inside, its a pretty big club - indoor/outdoor and two dance rooms. The only thing is that it gets sooo crowded. It's tough to actually get on the dancefloor and be able to move...I'm not exaggerating, if you guys check it out you'll know what I mean lol but if you love to dance like me, you can always find a spot - like at someone's table while standing on the seats? lol\n\nI love the dayclub here too. They have cabanas with a private hot tub which my friends and I got comped in for (woohoo!!) which was a lot of fun! It's a beautiful pool area\n\nfun stuff- thumbs up!"

Drove up to the window, 6 employees were standing behind the counter. I honked the horn several times and tried to waive them down. They ignored me like I didn't exist. This wasn't the first time I arrived before 9pm which is the time that's posted that they close and they closed early. They could of at least had the decency to tell me they were closed, don't ignore me when you know I'm there. Now I see why Tacos El Gordos next store remains busy. It's not just the quality of food, it's also the appreciation and respect of your loyal customers!"
0,"I usually go to Kathy's Alterations and she is great.  I usually don't buy dry clean only items, but I had a dress that needed to be dry cleaned.  Took it in and was told I needed to pre-pay, which was fine.  When I went to pick it up I was told they were unable to clean it due to a built in belt made of leather which they said could be ruined by the dry cleaning process. What I can't believe is that I wasn't issued a refund. I paid cash.  Not much, but I don't want \""credit\"" since I can't bring that item back and I don't wear clothes that I have to have dry cleaned.  The teenagers working there were not \""authorized\"" to do anything and the owner is \""out of town\"" and a manager is \""not available\"".  Learn to run a business. I am always able to call the owner for help at my job if there is a problem. I won't be back. I should have checked other reviews first."
1,The salad was excellent.  The bread and butter was incredible.  I thoroughly enjoyed the main entree of fettucini Alfredo.  It was obviously made from scratch and tasted so good!  Dont let the location fool you. What a great find.
0,"It has been so long since I did a review, I feel badly that I am doing this for Jack In The Box. Especially since I had done one a year ago for this same location... But my experience today was so bad I feel it needed to be documented.\nI arrived at 5:05pm. There were two people in front of me at the register. When the man who was ordering was finished the cashier/manager walked away without saying anything. A few minutes had passed and she was still gone. I was 2nd in line and stepped to the Kiosk to place my order. Smart thinking on my part, not waiting till the cashier was back from break (or maternity leave).\n\nMy order was placed and I waited, and waited and waited. Being tall made it easy to look at the display monitor and see that my order had been in for a little over 10 minutes. But I kept waiting, and waiting.\n\nAt 15 minutes I flagged down the Drive Thru cashier. I told her it was obvious I was not getting my food, so could I get my money back? She called to the manager in the back that she needed a refund, then looked back at me and said \""your food is ready. Do you want it\""? I told her I would take the food.\n\nShe scrambled for a moment, then told the manager she better give me the refund. \nAfter a couple minutes of pushing buttons I was given my money back without an apology or even an explanation as to why I wasn't getting my food instead. I did get a snotty comment from her about them being short of help and how she needed to give the cook a break. (Seemed odd that the cook gets his break at 5pm dinner hour and the dining room closes, but like my brother says, \""you can't argue with minimum wage\"").\n\nI went home and began cooking dinner. As it cooked I took the online survey at \""talktojackinthebox[dot]com\"" and gave a pretty bad review. Oddly enough, I had little problem with the slow service time. My gripe was the poor way my complaint was handled. \n\nNow, for the total shocker. In under 5 hours from submitting the online form I received a call from the store's General Manager. At first thought you would be impressed at just how important that feedback is to them. You might assume that someone in the corporate office saw that and called the GM at home to deal with it. As for me, I was thinking \""Who the #@&# is calling me at 9:48pm\""?\n\nBeing in that restaurant for more than 20 minutes without a single employee acknowledging I was there has me suspect they are out of touch with the customers. Calling me at 12 minutes to ten to talk about it just proves it.\n\nSo Jack, here is my summary: I love you commercials, but the customer service is worse than deplorable. If being short of help is the problem I will do everything in my power to assist you. By NEVER returning to one of your restaurants you will need less staff, therefore, you are no longer short of help. Problem solved!"
1,"OK, I'm just going to say this first off.  This is not my type of place.  I don't go out of my way to eat organic. Chemicals are how I obtained my mutant powers.   I'm not a vegan. The cuter than animal, the better they taste.   I'm not gluten free.  I'm a pasta freak.  \n\nHowever, my wife is gluten free.  And the dietary restrictions her nutritionist has put her on means lots of lettuce wraps.  So, when she found this place on Groupon, we had to try it.\n\nAt first sight, I wasn't impressed.  The decor, well, it is in a Mall.  So, pretty much what I expected.  However, the food was good, the staff was super friendly, and the gluten free options were remarkable.  Everything, and I mean everything, on the menu could be made gluten free.  My wife's pita sandwich was delicious.  The pita tasted a little sweet, as most gluten free bread do.  But, other than that, it tasted just like a regular sandwich bread.  Her spicy potatoes were freakin' fantastic.  I kept steal them.  My sandwich was also good.  Not amazing, but definitely good.\n\nOverall, I liked the place.  And would give it 3 stars.  But, knowing how hard it is to find REAL gluten free options, I appreciated the place all the more.  So, I'm kicking it up to 4 stars just because of the amazing options they offer people with dietary restrictions and choices.  My wife is an incredible baker.  And she has created some delicious recipes for gluten free baking.  So, I know how hard it is to make good tasting gluten free breads."
0,"NO NO NO. First off, we did not stay here because we wanted to. My husband and I are both active duty and we were staying in base lodging, but had to move here when there was no longer availability for us on base (were waiting to close on a house). When we called to make reservations, the women who we spoke to was pleasant enough. She had told us that there were utensils and other things provided for the kitchenette. We walked in and i swear i wanted to turn right back around. It reminded me of an 80s massacre movie/porn film. The \""kitchenette\"" had a butter knife, 2 forks and 2 spoons and a few glasses. We went down to the front desk and they said they'd try to get something for us and we had a few pots delivered the next day. Needless to say we ended up buying a cutting board, some knives and other essentials for cooking a meal. Our refrigerator was broken and didn't work, luckily they came out and swapped it that same day. We also wanted them to check on our AC because i swear that thing is possessed. They came to \""look\"" at it but said there was nothing they can do unless it stops working. It wakes us up every few hours with groans and pounding noises and screeches. Its not fun at all. The towels are a joke, if you want to call them towels. On the plus, the internet is pretty fast though. we were stuck with a room of 2 double beds. We thought one of the mattresses smelled of urine but nope, come to find out, there is an amazingly strong odor of urine just under the bed on the carpet! Yay! it smells so bad. The other double bed wasn't as bad..we only found one bug crawling in it so far. UGH! This place is not worth the money even with the sorry excuse for a military discount. I was considering moving into my coworkers RV instead of living here, but we are so tired of moving all our stuff around. Oh yeah- and the housekeeping only comes once a week- if you want it more often it costs extra..i think they said $40. NOT WORTH IT! Do not stay here if you have kids you care about or don't want to witness drug possession. On our way to and from the pool there is a lovely couple of people sitting at their couches rolling/smoking blunts in there with the door open. i wish i could not give any stars. The people at the front desk are so rude as well."
1,Good food..portions were small but food was up to my standards
1,"We just moved out here this year.  We've been to 3 indian restaurants in Vegas so far, and this one is the best by far!  Soups are fantastic, the vindaloo, rogan josh and curry dishes are awesome, and the drinks are reasonably priced.\n\nBest indian restaurant in Vegas IMO."
0,"So, disappointing, I can't tell you. I live in walking distance and wanted for months to stop in. I finally walked in yesterday (Sunday) at around 4:00pm. Sat outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot and road. Ever since My Big Fat Greek Restaurant closed near by, I've been desperate for a consistent \""go to\"" for noshing and drinks. Perfect Pear is a faux bistro with no bar, no charm and zero ambience. The restaurant smelled like smelly cheese - maybe cheap grated romano - so the patio was the escape. The menu offers typical easy-to-make, low risk, but high profit dishes. The drink menu is pedestrian and boring. No buttery chards and warm room temp reds. The waitress thought Pinot Gris was a misprint and apologized !?! So, the foodie in me already knows the pasta selections are embarrassingly ill conceived, so think American corporate like Chili's or Carraba's. So, what to do? Well, order something that few restaurants can screw up --- bruschetta!!  Trendy, high profit, easy with fresh ingredients. The Classic came on soggy focaccia, hardly toasted, with tasteless, off-red tomatoes with red onion and julienne'd basil (not torn). Then, (get this) topped with cheap-of-the-cheap romano cheese (see above). Any shot at being edible was ruined by the grated romano. The Chef must have zero culinary instincts or just doesn't care because there is no real competition in the area. Unforgiveable. The Lolita was actually worse. Please don't say \""avocado\"" when you really mean a brown guac spread. We ordered the olives and pesto goat cheese. Why ruin pesto with goat cheese? The crostini with the olives was the best part of the meal. My partner reconstructed the bruschetta using the crostini and the edible parts of what was served. I marvel at new owners who seemingly don't avail themselves of the basic \""how to's\"" and \""do's and dont's\"" of culinary. \n\nPlease -- owner and chef -- do a dine around in Phoenix, take the entire week and then re-vamp your concept and menu. I'll be back in (3) months because I refuse to go to Native New Yorker. I'm serious. \n\nMuch luck.   D"
1,"Egg & I has become a recent tradition with the future in-laws.\n\nIt's a nice change-of-pace versus the Strip and a mere ten minute drive but not worth the added expense if you plan on cabbing.\n\nParking is plentiful and there is a delicious bakery with some of the stickiest baklavas in the same strip mall to warmup while you wait (ranging from 10 to 30 min).\n\nPrices are reasonable, service is shoddy, and luckily one cannot mess up eggs.  Food wasn't greasy for whatever's thats worth.\n\nAs you may have guessed menu is egg-centric but fear not.  I decided to change things up during my latest visit and ordered hawaiian food.  Yep, you read that right and my internal organs as of a week later remain intact.  They offer: loco moco, spam and eggs and portuguese sausage and eggs.  Ordered both the spam and portuguese sausage and had no regrets.  Forgot the name of the breakfast burrito with the chorizo but it was dense AF and subsequently awesome.\n\nTheir homefries are also a must."
1,I went to this location as they were in my network providers and conveniently located in a shopping center I frequent - their cross streets are Eastern & St. Rose.  Upon entering I was greeted by one of their sales associates and I found throughout my hour in the store every customer would be greeted warmly and asked how they can be assisted.  I was directed to the reception desk for the doctor and promptly checked in and given forms.  Within 10 minutes I was brought in for my annual eye exam.  Each step of the exam went smoothly and I never waited longer than 10 minutes for either the doctor or tech - the hour went by fast. \n\nHaving insurance I was clearly explained how I could use my benefits and given their opinion how I should use it based on my needs i.e. use my credit towards contacts vs a new pair of eye glasses.  I was never explained this before so other stores would just get my money out of pocket and I would never know about my benefits and how to maximize it!  Really nice to be able to trust their services at this store.  Will be coming back for my new frames in a couple months.  \n\nMy appointment was on a Monday morning - not sure if this is a peak time but when I was there business picked up to about 10-15 customers in the store and everyone was being taken care of in a timely manner! I also saw a little girl about 6-7 years old getting an exam and was crying and seemed scared - everyone was patient with her and coaching her through it.  Parents seemed at ease and the staff is very friendly! Highly recommended!
1,"Just got back on this saturday afternoon and I am extremely impressed with this shop. Its clean, great floor plan, clean cases. The staff is excellent as soon as they finished with their current customers I was greeted immediately. Told them that I was looking for a Ruger SR40 which all they had was the compact version, the employee I worked with suggested a FN FNS40 and wow, it fit me perfectly. I mentioned I'm really just looking around until I have the funds and he continued to answer questions and even suggested using them as a FFL dealer if I still wanted the Ruger. We BS'd for a bit, shook hands and told me to keep researching until I found a gun that would work for me and said our good byes. I'll definitely be using this shop, and its worth the long drive to north scottsdale."
1,"I went here around 10:30 on a Tuesday. There were no other customers, and they cleaned and vacuumed my car in about 15 minutes. I asked for the basic, full-service wash for $11.99, and they didn't try to sell me up to something more expensive which I appreciate. The waiting area was clean and roomy, and there was a movie playing on the flat-screen TV. The volume was up pretty loud. They did a great job cleaning the outside of the car and a decent job on the inside. They wiped it down, cleaned the windows and vacuumed the floors and seats. My only complaint was that there was still dog hair on the backs of the backseat - otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. I'll definitely be back though, and next time I'll point it out beforehand."
0,"been to burger bar in san francisco and I am a HUGE fan. The service here however was terrible. It is obvious that  servers here DO NOT split the tips by the way every single waiter but the guy who took my order ignored me when I was standing up out of my seat waving a waiter down for a check. Not once did my \""waiter\"" come and ask how the food was. NOT once did i get a refill on my water. Worse service I have ever experienced anywhere in Las Vegas."
1,"We went to Ocean Prime the other night and it was delicious.  I don't know if it was worth the money but it was definitely good.  The setting is as attractive as any restaurant I can remember, with classical contemporary decor and a very cool display of alcohol bottles in the bar.\n\nI was in a party of seven and the prevalent dish was the bone-in filet.  We had heard it was better than the steakhouses in Chicago.  Well I'm from Chicago, and trust me, you get a better (and bigger) bone-in filet at Joe's.  But it was still a delicious steak.  The sides were terrific and the salads were good too.  But those prices!  Wow, value is not this restaurant's strong suit.\n\nAbout the only other thing I'll add is the service was below average, a concern considering what the prices were like.  Our server tried hard but he was too slow and didn't get our order right."
0,"I wanted to get out of Las Vegas and go to San Diego. Really bad, it was too late to get a good deal on airplane tickets by the time I started planning it, so Greyhound was the next best thing. A lot of people were warning me against it and no one likes to travel by bus anymore but I figured it really couldn't be that bad.\n\nTurns out, it wasn't that bad. It was worse.\n\nI love Downtown Vegas and have been desensitized to the seediness for the most part, but despite the ~glamorous neon-sequin facade, this station freaked me out. I can go to the Gold Spike, stay in a room at the El Cortez, walk back and forth to the DTC(at night), wander around in alleys surrounding the Arts District, and take a drive on Fremont east of 6th St. all without a problem, but this station scares me. The thing that makes it even scarier is that the LA station is actually nicer(granted, I was there during the day, but it was much larger and spacious, there weren't as many drug addicts and scumbags hanging around and it was MUCH cleaner. HOWEVER, they also have no idea what they hell they're doing at this station, I'll go into detail about that later). It's loaded with questionable figures who quite possibly were just hanging out(or maybe even LIVING there) instead of waiting for a bus. It smelled like a bleached sewer and our bus ride was even delayed due to cops coming in to investigate something. The staff was nice and helpful at this location though(but that's really not enough to warrant another star). \nAnyways, I got on that bus, and it sucked so much. I'm about 6'1 and these seats were incredibly cramped, I believe there was a point on the ride where EVERYONE on the bus was asleep except myself because I was so uncomfortable.\nSo after about almost 6 hours of leg discomfort, we FINALLY get off at the LA station so we can transfer. One problem though, there were TWO buses scheduled for San Diego and both of them were late, there were people waiting for a San Diego bus for up to 3 hours. Since the buses didn't seem to ever pull up to the right door anyway, whenever we asked a ticket agent if a bus was going to SD they would get very rude and impatient with us. We weren't trying to scapegoat them at all, but our bus was 2-3 hours late and we were looking for answers. Just tell us whether or not the bus was going to San Diego, simple yes or no question that doesn't require being handled in an unprofessional manner.\nThankfully, this bus was much more spacious. My legs finally had room, but this was already such a shitty experience that pretty much nothing could have made up for it except finally getting off at my intended destination.\nNo wonder no one likes riding the Greyhound bus. Very shitty company with very shitty service and very shitty procedures. If I ever need a quick travel fix again, I'm looking up a charter."
0,"After reading a few reviews and desperately searching for the One Pizza To Rule Them All here in AZ, I decided it was time to try Sauce (also, I didn't want to study any more).  I'm not sure exactly what I expected, but Sauce wasn't it.\n\nIt was good.  Not great, but decent.  The food was fresh and hot.  It tasted fine, I just wasn't really thrilled by it.  I just felt like I could have ordered a pizza from the school cafeteria and would have gotten only slightly less quality (and no wine).  Oh, and the wine servings are very tiny.  Not a way to earn fans."
0,"One star is way too high a rating for this place.  It might be cheap, but it is not worth the saved cash.  Stayed there on business.  My first night there they placed me in a room on the strip.  \nFirst problem was that the wi-fi did not work.  How do I do business with without wi-fi?  Second problem was the 80's band cranking right outside my window. \nIn th morning I asked for another room.  This room was better, but but still damp, plain, old, ugly, dark, and a maze to get to.  That night I came back to my room, but the key didn't work.  After several trips to the front desk they had to get security to let me in.  \nThis place is a disaster plain and simple.  The casino smells like an old Chinese restaurant and the rooms are putrid.  Even the elevators are slow and rusty.  Price and location are not enough to justify the Imperial Palace."
0,"Disappointed. :( \n\nThis has been my favorite car wash. I've been going here for 7 years. No, they do not know me, but the service and quality have been good and consistent. I go out if my way to go here. About 15 miles out if my way, each way. \n\nThe problem? \nFirst... I always got the platinum car wash for $27 (it used to be $25). Today the same services cost me $31. \nSecond... They were severely understaffed. I was informed after going through the wash that they were running behind. It took 44 minutes in total for a services that usually takes about 25 minutes. \n\nIf you are that understaffed let people know before they pay for the service. When you increase your prices by 15% in my case, you are raising the bar. You missed it!!!\n\nSorry... I won't be back. There is a full-service car wash much closer to where I live. It's no longer worth it to go out if my way to use this facility."
0,"We received a flyer on our door for this place and thought we'd try it out. My boyfriend and I love our pizza and wings and are always willing to try new places. Too bad, we didn't look this place up on Yelp first. I called the Scottsdale location to place my order and the employee who answered was just generally rude and rushing me on the phone. When our food came 45 min later we were baffled by how disgusting and flavorless it was. It even smelled funny! We got an X-Large cheese pizza and 20 Wings. The wings were dry on the inside, soggy on the outside, barely had any sauce on them and smelled gross! Our pizza had too much sauce, the cheese refused to stay on the pizza, ridiculously greasy, and even though they tried to redeem the flavor by putting a huge amount of oregano and pepper on it, still tasteless! The only descent thing about this place was the prices but we discovered, in this case, you can't even get what you pay for. I really hope this place doesn't survive to kill anyone else's appetite."
0,I love Denny's but after eating here I think I have to stay away from Denny's from a while. The service was terrible and there's no nice way to put it. We were given a bad attitude as soon as we walked in the door....way to set the mood!  I was mostly displeased with the female security guard for being so rude and off. I don't know maybe the terrible service is due to the fact that we visited this place late night...but  that is no excuse to treat customers so horribly.
1,"Pure is clutch man. Went on a Sunday night this time and the party was poppin'. We were originally at XS, but that place is just too big for its own good sometimes. So we cabbed it over to Pure and it was well worth it.\n\nSuggestion: do a little legwork and grab some free passes during the day. Even though we got there post midnight, we just gave the passes and got in, no cover. Also, no line really either. \n\nOnly the rooftop was open, but that's like the best part of Pure anyway. We got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone seemed pretty friendly, and my buddy got in a C-walk battle with some Eastern European man. A good time was had by all."
1,Very authentic. It was refreshing to find this spot when I lived in LV. Goooood eats. I think its hilarious how theres way more stuff you can order if you look at the walls. Good eats and its open late.
0,"Ok. Simple. This is not for a lack of trying on my part, or any decor, service-related part of this restaurant, but this review is purely food based. Particularly of the menu variety. Because a pho soup is definitely made using a meat stock ( along with meat in the soup ). We know that, we really do. (us vegans that is!)\n\nThat's the problem with listing a pho in the vegetarian part of the menu. When you use a BEEF stock, it no longer is a vegetarian offering.\nPlease stop misinforming through your menu's listing."
1,"Best Thai place on this side of the country.  I've been going to Lotus for over 5 years now and every time I swear it gets better.  From the friendly staff to the amazing food, you cant go wrong here."
0,"I used to come here all the time and I made sure I always made it here when I came to Las Vegas. However, on my most recent visit, the food was just not good. The pastas were bland and the crepes were only as good as one you can get at ihop. On a brighter note, the coq au vin was quite good as well as the prime rib. I probably won't come back as there are so many better buffet options here."
0,I have been at Laser for less in Scottsdale twice. The second time was about a week ago and I was burnt. Now I have 4 dark marks on my skin. I went back to the place and they told me that they might have applied the laser too high and they gave me a cream to apply it to the damaged area but it is not working. I am going to wait a few more days If the marks dont go away I will seek legal advice .  Laser burns should not happened. Definitely I do no recommend this place to anybody. Technicians seem to be too young and lack of experience
0,Extremely disappointed. Enough said.
1,"I like this place. It is quite authentic and I know authentic, trust me.\n\nOkay, they have some of the funky things fo the Western palate, but they have geat Clams, steamed fish, ox tail soup, and fried frog legs. You gotta be geat to have this stuff, and this place is one of my favorites to go to when I can't make it downtown.\n\nLots of Asians dine here, which means it is good."
0,"$50 later & I've got that sinking feeling again... This was an awful meal. I ordered some grilled shrimp plate w/ broccoli & corn. The broccoli was cold mush, the corn was just cold. My shrimp was cold as well & smeared with a disgusting \""mango pico de gallo\"" they called it. I, however, tasted nothing you could decipher as mango. My husband's dinner was just as disappointing. Crispy panko chicken should be CRISP & not smeared with cheese sauce. I don't understand their menu, I don't agree with their flavors, simple as that. Save your money."
1,"My hubby and I got swedish massages here. I got mine for $99, since there was a summer special for Vdara hotel guests. Not too bad for a brand new, Vegas spa massage for 50 minutes.\n\nYou can use the facilities up to 8pm the day of your service, so feel free to come back whenever you like. They have your basic amenities like everything you need for a shower, freshening up (hair brushes, hair spray, lotions, etc.), snacks, refreshments, sauna, jacuzzi, and steam room.\n\nI've been to Qua and this place is a bit smaller, but more \""up to date\"". The only thing that this spa has that Qua doesn't is the Meditation Lounge. This is where you can take a nap after your services. It literally has several beds with blankets on them. Nice to lay down after a relaxing massage, and listen to water flowing. =)\n\nThe price of a day here for guests is $25, and $50 for those not staying at the hotel. It's a lot less crowded here than other spas I've been to, but I think it's because of the price. Nice for me, since there were at most 3 people in at a time.\n\nDefinitely worth $99 for a facial and massage. Next time I'm gonna get a deep tissue massage..."
0,"If i could give less than one star I would!!! God help you if they file any information you give them it will only seem to get lost, and they will deny up and down ever getting it!! I could handle paying 650 for four driving courses, what I couldn't handle was them coming a day in advance while I was at work, did they some how think i would drive using telekinesis??? No they called my phone a thousand times supposably!! The problem with that i had changed that number a week after i scheduled my appointment and while i called the day i had received my new number so they could list it for future use they decide it against listing it, when i called about the confused date they denied it up and down saying i had scheduled that day and gave no number apparently i had scheduled the drive only to sit at work and have them do a scavenger hunt, so now i have to pay a fee of 50 dollar to schedule a new drive all because they didn't feel the need to write down a simple number. You would think with customers paying 650 they would be a little more attentive apparently they stop caring once they receive that check."
0,"I love the concept of this restaurant and I was really excited to try it, the decor is cool and fun and the menu is interesting.  The service was friendly.  Kudos to someone who has a great idea and nuts up and goes through with it so I was glad to give them my business. \n\nThe two sandwiches I have had weren't all that great though, in a word greasy.  Now I love grilled cheeses and I have made some good ones myself and I load them up with butter and they get toasty, buttery, crispy, and gooey (AKA delicious).  Here it fell short and was limp and greasy.  The bread was barely toasted and I don't think they use butter but some type of oil instead.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on one were grey and not brown and caramelized like they should be and they were also greasy too.  The cheese was barely melted so the sandwich wasn't held together by the melted cheese, a lot of the filling slipped out.  The salami I had in another sandwich was real low quality but worked out ok because it was soft and easy to bite.  \n\nIt really reminded me of the quality of some greasy diner and I had hopes for something more from the self proclaimed gourmet grilled cheese place.    \n\nIt is so true, with a simple thing like a grilled cheese the most important component is the execution and that was the biggest downfall."
1,"A wonderful experience from beginning to end. Delightful wine, fantastic food and truly remarkable service.\n\nI was intimidated to take myself out to a fancy dinner alone when I found myself in Vegas with my man who was tied up in meetings most of the time. My experience at B&B washed away all of my solo dining insecurities. My server was so sweet and gave me just enough attention to make me feel taken care of and not so much to make me feel like he was trying to be my date! \n\nThe food: an amazing roasted tomato salad with fresh burrata. I could take a bath in this burrata. DE-lish. My entree was the blue crab ravioli and it was absolutely worth the copious consumption of carbs. \n\nThere wasn't a thing I would change about my trip to B&B."
1,"Ha, this was surprisingly good.  I ordered the Banana Berry Cinn and after a reasonable wait, it was ready to go.  It is not the prettiest crepe I have had, but it was flavorful and good.  Overall, very good."
0,Dick's was in the hotel we stayed in. We stopped by to check out the live music which was actually pretty good. The drinks were good but the bartenders were blah. No personality and not real attentive. The bar was rather empty so I would have expected more interaction. I really wasn't impressed but maybe on a more happening night I would have really loved it. I wouldn't go back even if I was staying in the same hotel.
1,Great place to drink some ale and watch Les Habitants!  Wings looked good too... I didn't try them because we were full from one of the delicious french bistro's in town.
0,"Pretty shitty place. Bad atmosphere, bad food."
1,"Came here to get quarters for the parking meter, but felt guilty asking for change so we decided to purchase something. The man behind the counter was SO nice, and when I started asking questions about what everything was, he very patiently explained it all to me. Zam Zam water is holy water, didja know that? You can buy it here if you want! \n\nThey also have quite possibly the BEST baklava I have ever had: hazelnut, drizzled in chocolate, perfectly made. LOVED it. I am going to see if they can ship it to me, I have never had baklava that delicious and now that I have I don't think I can live without it. \n\nYUMMMMM!"
0,"OK, so after 2 tries, I'm giving this a 2 star review, which is a bit negative. Place is colorful as all get-out, and fun, loud, and kind of exciting first time you visit. After the 2nd time though, I think it's a tad overpriced for all the fanfare. And, yet we have another fast food joint, made to be a restaurant, where you have to pick up your own food. \n\nNote to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food, bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line, I don't want to wait for my name to be called, just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting.\nI'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food, in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog. But I can grab a can of Hormel's chili for a buck, and package of hot dogs for 2 bucks, and with cheese and inions, I can feed myself and 4 friends for about a buck each. What's the difference between my deal and this place? About Ten Frickin' Dollars I tell ya'. I can get a better hot dog at Costco, thank you very much. Won't be returning.\n\nAnd all you people from Chicago... Always talking about your town... Selling out the Diamondback games when your beloved Cubs are in town... Welcome Chicago to the Desert, etc. etc. Why did ya'all leave, and why are you here, if it's such a gosh-darn great town?????????"
0,"Been a resident here for 14 months. New ownership right after I signed 2nd year lease in July. First I should point out at renewal the agent in the office quoted us a rate. When we came to sign the paperwork the next day, price was $70 a month higher. The woman working said he must have misquoted us. I fought with corporate office for 3 days to get then to honor the quote he gave. Since that time service has dropped to horrible levels. Shower head broke off - 3 days to replace. Sink faucet knob broke in half. Guy looked at it & told me he had a knob for it but needed to go to storage room to get it. Said he'd be back in 10 minutes. Never returned. 3 days later it was replaced after I had to contact the office about it again twice. The excuse? Only 1 maintenance guy on staff. Now, our washing machine is broken. It overflowed a week ago & flooded our hall. Went to office to let them know & she said she would send maintenance right over. Never came. Contacted them again next day & excuse was, again, only 1 maintenance guy on staff. Guy came and shop vacuumed water but was still another day to look at washer. Got a call from manager that it's fixed. Yay right? Wrong! So it isn't overflowing now. It just doesn't spin out or refill for rinse cycle. Doh! Went to office again. Will have someone look at it \""tomorrow\"". Tomorrow came & no one came so I called office an hour before closing (it was Friday). Excuse? Again, only 1 maintenance guy on staff. And no one will be here over the weekend so she'll have him come Monday. Not to be a dick, but them having only 1 maintenance guy is their problem, not mine. a week and still no washer? how about pulling a working one from an empty apartment for a quick fix? Or at least a credit to my rent for having to go to a laundromat 2 weeks in a row? Creative solutions & customer service people! But there is neither, just excuses. Hence this review recommending you STAY AWAY from this property."

1,"Effectivement, bon burger ! Tr\u00e8s abordable, viande de qualit\u00e9, grosses portions, beaucoup de choix de garnitures gratuites (oignons grill\u00e9s, champignons, moutarde de dijon,..) de plus les \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9s comme les frites \u00e9pic\u00e9es ou encore la salade c\u00e9sar sont quand m\u00eame assez gros. Donc, si vous voulez, un d\u00e9licieux burger de qualit\u00e9, c'est la place \u00e0 mon avis !"
1,Came back to this famous place after years of not going and ordered the appetizer fish and chips. It was the very best fish and chips I have ever eaten anywhere. Just wish the portion size were just a bit more and the price was a bit less. But will definitely be going there again to have something different on the menu because if they can make fish and chips this great the rest of the meals must be fantastic. The beer and drinks were served in smaller than usual glasses put charges the same price as if it were 12 ounces or more
0,"THIS PLACE SHOULD BE CALLED SCORPION CITY. The bugs are out of control! Crickets and scorpions are literally all over the grounds. Just last night we found 4 scorpions in our house.The floor plans are great, views are nice, however the amount of bugs and how poorly these aparments were constructed is ridiculous. The noise is awful...we hear every single step our neighbors take. Worst experience I have ever had renting in my life."
0,"I never wanted to be one of those people that give bad reviews but I just had to.  Maybe it's because I grew up in California and have had better pho's, but this place was no pho. I don't know if I came at a bad day or somebody was new but food was bad. No good service can compensate for the food. That's how horrible it was. Don't get the rice plates! Stick with the pho. I didn't try their appetizers but maybe that would be better."
1,"This is a real, on site laundry. My husband's dress shirts haven't looked this nice since they came from the store. Mastel has actually removed a lot of collar/cuff dirt from 2yrs old shirts, it's amazing. The press job is uniform and neat, no puckered areas, no blobs of seared starch and they fold & press French Cuffs. A blouse I thought was ruined, they worked on it, the stain came out and no damage to the fabric. As for regular dry cleaning, my clothes no longer have repulsive chemical smell, yay!"
1,"As a visitor from Chicago and only experiencing one froyo joint--I was looking forward to visiting Yogurt Land than any other activity we had planned. \n\nThis is the reason why I will move to Arizona. \n\nYogurt Land has a very diverse set of yogurt flavors, and an array of toppings.\n\nFor only $.30/oz. it was so inexpensive for such a large amount of goodness! They only have one bowl, so you determine the pricing. \n\nObviously, the more toppings/fro-yo you put, the more it'll be... but honestly who looks at price when you know you're about to indulge in greatness?\n\nGo visit, please !"
0,"\""weigH\"" overpriced and the food was mediocre at best...not much more to say...saw what appeared to be a comparable place at the Venetian - prices were 50% to 33% less than this place and looked good...will try that next time because this place sucked with a capital \""S\"" and that doesn't stand for Super(man) either."
1,"Now here's a good place.\n\nI didn't want to eat here; fish restaurant, weird location from my hotel, looked too trendy to have good food. I was wrong. Great meal.\n\nWe showed up with more in our party than in our reservation. \""No problem, just a minute to set up new tables.\"" Cool.\n\nI don't drink but we had a party of 12 and those that had cocktails loved them. There was the LV-usual menu of house cocktails.  The bartender was accommodating, but when one of our party wanted a house specialty without an ingredient, the waitress came back and explained that the bartender felt the drink wouldn't be enjoyable and would she like something different? She would and she did. They were good.\n\nI ordered an appetizer and then I asked the waiter for his opinion of a dish. He said that if I liked {my appetizer} then I would really like (his suggestion). OK, I'll try it. \n\nWait staff is young and smart. Not too chatty, but if you engage them, they'll talk. Just the right amount. They were quick, accommodating and professional.\n\nI had the lump crab cocktail and steak Oscar, both very excellant. I should have had the steak cooked more than medium, but that was my fault. I didn't mention it, but I think if I did, they would have helped me out. I got that vibe off them.\n\nDessert was chocolate something and good. Coffee came with biscotti and were yummy.\n\nNot inexpensive, but I got value, I think. Cool place, up-scale and comfortable. Not over-the-top good enough to be 5 star but getting close. I'll go back."
1,"Nice fun in the sun.  You can't beat the view!  Wynn, Encore and nice looking women!!!  Be prepared to bring lots of cash for drinks."
0,"Uhh.. had the worst experience here.\n\nMy cousins and I walked in and the waitresses acknowledged us but we waited about 10-15MIN. just to get seated.  I don't get why it took so long because we looked in the eating area and there were tables that weren't being occupied.  \n\nAnyway, we ordered and it took forever to get our food.  Almost 20 MIN!!  When we got our food, everything tasted mediocre and I was not a happy camper after waiting almost 30MIN. just to get ok food."
1,"The Signature is pretty nice and smoke-free which is a huge plus.  The staff was friendly and the cafe in Tower 2 had a very tasty breakfast!  When we would call down for extra linens or room service, it was very prompt.  The rooms were generally clean (see below for issues).  We had a bachelorette pre-party in our room and it went off without a hitch.  It connects to the MGM Grand and the other Signature towers through a tunnel like system complete with people movers to minimize walking.  We walked through the MGM Grand Lobby around check in time during our stay and saw what a zoo that was and were happy that we did not have to endure that Disneyland-on-a-Saturday-in-the-summer length line (or, Ramen-Festival-in-San-Francisco length line).  Free wifi!\n\nThere were some odd things that I kept saying, \""this is going on my yelp review\"" while I stayed there with some friends recently, though, that drove me nuts -- which is why I deducted 1 star:\n\n1) The doors to get in to the lobby are not automatic which is OK but makes it hard to walk in when you're carrying luggage & there is not a door person.\n2) No free early check in -- we arrived about 3 hours prior to check in and the only response the gentleman at the front desk gave us when we asked if our room was ready was that \""Check in is at 3.\""  I later found out from another friend that she called ahead to ask for an earlier check-in but they charged her for it.  We were not even provided with the option to pay to check in early.\n3)  Since we couldn't check in early, we opted to leave our bags with the bell hop, who was oddly located outside in the heat.  We all thought that was weird.  Luggage is placed in an air-conditioned room, though.\n4) You have to call ahead to receive your allotment of 4 plates, 4 forks, 4 knives, 4 cups, etc., and they charge you for it.  Booo.\n5)  We reserved a one-room balcony suite and they only provided 1 cup in the master bathroom and did not provide blankets/sheets for the pull out queen bed.\n6)  The TV did not work in the living area -- I would press the on button and the TV would turn on then off a few seconds later, press the channel change button and the volume would go up, etc.\n7)  When we got in our room, there was a dirty towel on the floor in the master suite and some prior guest left a headband behind that housekeeping did not see or forgot to pick up.\n\nI'd stay there again, even though the things above annoyed me."
0,"The line is not well marked, where do you start??, it's kind of important. \n\nThe coffee was generic, there were no coffee stirrers, the lids were clear plastic & I don't think their meant for hot drinks. \n\nI wasn't looking to be blown away, but I was less than impressed."
0,"Another mediocre brew pub on my trip to Montreal. The beer tasted like...generic beer. Nothing to write home about. I had the amber ale. Meh. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the burger. The only thing that was enjoyable about it would be the ciabatta bread that it came on. It's always worrisome when the server doesn't ask you how you would like the burger prepared, and, as a result, the burger was overdone. Not helping was the fact that it tasted like a pre-formed thawed beef patty out of a box. Womp womp. \n\nThe portions are also small for the price you are paying."
1,"I had the T. Rex poutine two nights ago.  I still don't think it has left my system.  I don't think I want it to, either.

0,"\""Udder\"" disappointment.  Really had high hopes for this place.  Ice cream was good.  Service was terrible.  It was super slow so no reason for poor service.  Every table was dirty and sticky.  No excuse for this as it was not busy at all.  Young guy behind the counter was more interested in talking with his friend than making it a good experience for the customer.   Won't be back!"

Then brought a 4 year old a GLASS to drink out of. Good took forever and when it did arrive, it was wrong!! Manager came over and I explained what was wrong and he stated he would \""remove the burger from the bill\"". Asked for the bill and waited another 10 minutes to receive that...which the burger was still on the bill. WILL NEVER GO GO BACK!! The staff does not give a shit!!\n#harveyamericanpubhouse #horribleservice #getnewstaff #food #eatingout"
0,"What a waste of time. I was in town, visiting with my sister and wanted to grab a quick snack. So I found a Groupon deal that read $7 for two waffles/crepe. With that said, you would presume that meant what it's stated. $7 for 2 (TWO) Waffles or Crepe. But nope, they take the cost displayed per item, which was about $5 - $6 per waffle/ or crepe. And then ended up ordering a mocha and a bottle of water. The total came out to be $25 (which the cashier subtracted $7), the total being $18. So not only did Groupon charge me $7 but the place charged me $18. I paid a total of $25 for two crepes/waffles and two beverages, which is the original cost. The cashier said he already took the deal into account. SO basically, there is no deal. \n\nIt's really deceptive advertising, and I'm a marketer myself. You don't lie like that. Crepe Shack & Waffles you should be ashamed of yourself!"

1,"I'm a bit of a tea fanatic, and the creator of http://ratetea.net so I feel I have high standards for reviewing this shop, and this place solidly earned 5 stars in my opinion.\n\nI was very pleased to find this place.  It has both normal tables, and cozy, low tables with cushions vaguely reminiscent of a Japanese aesthetic.\n\nThis place really specializes in high-quality, straight loose tea.  It's a place you would go if you enjoy your tea without milk or sugar.  The menu is large and diverse.  Most importantly, the people here know how to brew tea properly--including both gong fu brewing (small, brief infusions with more leaf) and using multiple infusions western-style (longer brewing times).\n\nThe tea here is also very good quality--which, alas, is rare here in the U.S., even among specialty tea shops.  The selection is comprehensive.  You can find some esoteric teas that they don't have here if you look online, but you'll find this place carries all of the well-known teas and quite a few less-well-known ones.  In particular, there's even a good selection of oolongs, which can be hard to find in the U.S.\n\nWe had the Da Hong Pao and it was outstanding--each infusion had a totally different character.\n\nI'm not sure why the other reviewer objected to the bells--I thought they were very cute.  There is a little bell on each table and you can ring it when you want service.\n\nVery inexpensive to drink tea in, given how knowledgeable the staff is about brewing, and how the high-quality teas are good for making many infusions.  I definitely recommend ordering a pot.\n\nI am eagerly awaiting coming back to this place!"
0,Service was slow... We were standing at the register for like 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged us!  We ordered the Taro and Almond Boba and it was nothing special!
0,"Food quality: 2/5\nThe food here is so bland. I minus one star for the lack of selection, minus one for the taste of the food they did have, and minus another for not having any crab legs... Everything they had tasted like something made at a normal buffet like Golden Corral or Hometown Buffet; I'd expect better from a Vegas buffet. Sorely disappointed.\n\nCustomer service: 2/5\nI only give them some stars because when I asked a random person for some ketchup, she brought it to me (though it took longer than one would expect). On top of that, we received our drinks from our waitress and saw her maybe once more for the rest of our 2 hour meal. \n\nAmbiance: 2/5\nIt just feels like a place that will disappoint. You have to take the escalator downstairs to the dungeon. Inside it's somewhat dimly lit, but not like a nice steak house dimly lit... It just looks terrible and it's laid out so you can only walk along the food area to get from one side to another. This may at first make sense because they want you to see the food, but when you're getting food from across the place and it would be slightly easier to cut through, let them. Don't put up a wall half way through the place so you have to go all the way back around by all the food again."
0,"I'm born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to find the best ramen in Vegas.   I tried the top 3 per Yelp:  YK, Ichiza and Monta.  When I walked into YK I was greeted very well and the service was great.  I kept hoping the ramen is good so I will come back often.  Unfortunately the shoyu ramen was very average.   For me in Vegas ramen at  Ichiza was #1, and Monta #2.  Neither compares to the Santouka Ramen in Calif,  but until it comes to Vegas, I'll eat ramen at Ichiza."
0,"Our services was not that great . our dinner took forever. We maybe saw our sever twice, and even he acted as if he had better things to do..not very happy overall .was our first and last time at this location."
1,Really good clean food with great customer service - I absolutely will be back here when in the area

0,"I completely forgot about my experience 2 years ago and went back to eat  again...\nThis time, they didn't list the auto-grat in bill. Instead, they just added to the credit card bill after wards!!\nMy bill was $26.04, I put $28.00 in total, my statement says $30.04. They didn't like what I wrote for tip, so they gave themselves a little more. I left little for a reason. They didn't do anything to serve us! All they did was took the order, brought the food (not even at the same time. 3 meals came in 3 different times.) And the bill. No refill, no checking on how we're doing, or how the food tasted, or need anything else! \nKeep your receipt and check your account to make sure they don't add more amount than you wrote in.\nI'm not concerned about $2 they added more, it's the principle of the fact that they did it. Very bad way to do business. A scam."
0,"Totally cheap, nasty, gross food! Skip this place."
0,"Great espresso, delicious baked-goods. Beware, though, you MUST order very slowly, and be sure to enunciate. And maybe ask the counter person to repeat the order back to you. Otherwise, you may end up with a bowl of oatmeal swimming in espresso. And delivered to your table 30 minutes after you ordered."
0,"I've written this out so many times and each time it goes on waaayyyyyy to long. So let me put it this way. Truly the most disappointing experiences I've had with a health provider. They're so-called communication would be laughable if not for making my life so God damned difficult! Whenever they make mistakes, and in my case, they make a lot, they blame it on Goodman & Partridge being in a different building and so they get lots of things wrong because they can't effectively communicate. I'm so tired of that excuse because it has become clear that they have no intentions of making that system any better and therefore reducing confusion and their mistakes. They appear to like blaming all and everything on what I believe is try a benign inconvenience and one they really could fix and improve on, if they wanted to, but they obviously don't.\n\nAfter speaking to their triage nurse on Saturday, related to increasing pain due to my need for surgery on Tuesday...\n\nOh. Wait. I have to get this out there too. I'm told by Dr. Grier this past Wednesday that I need surgery. I ask when. She says they'll call next week. I return a call from their scheduler Thursday. No one calls me back. I call again Friday. She asks if I ate anything or took my medicine? Yes I have, why? Oh darn, she wanted me to come in for the surgery? WHAT? I don't have anyone to come with me as this is no notice at all. She says, but your in pain. I say, no kidding, still, I have nothing prepared. I was told next week. She says to go in on Saturday. Fine. I call my fianc\u00e9 and he gets the day off. She calls me back hours later explaining that while she was waiting on some other doctor to agree to my surgery, as it would not be dr. Grier, she lost my Saturday slot and now I'm to come in on Tuesday. I really wish she had her act together before putting me through all this bs but fine. Tuesday. Fine.\n\nSo the triage nurse gave me instructions related to pain medicine and assured me that she would note my record so on Monday Dr. Grier would see her notes and make the appropriate adjustments for me.\n\nI came in for my appt. At 11:10 for the sole purpose of taking care of my medicines before surgery tomorrow. My pain doctor already knew dr. Grier and had already okayed her writing me certain scripts as she had already done so only two weeks ago without a problem and before I had told my pain specialist about her. NOW, I had not only spoken to my pain specialist, I got the exact numbers of medicine that they were comfortable with her writing for.\n\nSo. Everything was in order. I was there for my appt and better prepared even than last time. So easy peasy, right? WRONG!! After nearly 45 minutes of waiting and watching patients who came in after me go in and then come out again, I asked about my appt. I was told that she was backed up, that there was no notes from the triage nurse from the weekend (but that was normal. Did I know this happens all the time because the triage and appointment people are at different locations? UGH!) and they didn't even know why I was there to begin with, although I had an appt at 11:10.\nI calmly explained (for the 4th time to these frigin people) that I was there to pick up my pain medicine as I was going to be a drooling fool tomorrow and I wanted to be certain that everything was arranged as my particular situation may make another doctor, as the surgeon who will care for me tomorrow might and who doesn't know me as Grier does, confused. I even tell her the okayed doses and amounts from my pain doctor are. I even offer that she can skip my time if she could just kindly write out the script, like she did two weeks ago, and I would happily return to my bed and heating pad.\nShe disappears for 20 minutes. Upon her return, I am informed that she won't and she said there was no explanation. Of course there wasn't, there was no reason to say no if she understood the entire matter. Which she didn't. Without being in the room I already know what quite likey happened. She mish mashed my entire message and as apparently the triage notes were gone she had no idea of the entire scenario. Plus, it was almost lunch time. I decided to stay and explain myself to her face to face. I was assured that my place in line was as it was before, she would see me next for sure. Appointment arrival 11:05 - Appointment time 11:10 - Told I was next 11:55 - brought into room 11:59 - Sat in agonizing pain until 12:50ish - Stormed out a minute later. Staff are shocked that I was not seen yet but helpless to do anything as the \""doctors do their own thing.\""\nI really don't know what the hell that means. You mean to tell me that no one could run back to the lunchroom and kindly remind her that her patient had waited two hours for her and was in too much pain to wait any longer? Apparently they couldn't, as they didn't even apologize as I exited the office. Truly horrible! If I didn't need this surgery 2 weeks ago I would completely wash my hands of this place!!"
1,The one restaurant a friend recommended we go to in Montreal was Jardin Nelson simply for their French onion soup. This place is in Old Montreal and the inside doesn't let you forget that with the stone walls. It's cool!\n\nAll we ordered was the French onion soup and it was amazing! One bowl was enough for each of us and we slowly ate it to savor every bite. It also helped that it was pouring down rain so soup was the perfect lunch!\n\nDefinitely stop here to try heir French onion soup if you're visiting Old Montreal.
1,"I regularly order stuff here.  I am a big fan of the Alfredo chicken and broccoli.  They do a good job at it.  Taste great and the seasoned chicken strip is good.  I like their spaghetti as well.  The hot sausage they have is pretty good.  I also like their Angus bacon burger.  Their fries are surprisingly good if it gets delivered in time.  The chef salad is good.  So is the antipasto.\n\nSome of their sandwiches are good.  Their steak sandwiches are not.  The meat they use sucks and the sandwich was bland in general.  Their garlic bread sucks too.  Doesn't taste like garlic bread.  It didn't even taste like butter.\n\nOverall, they got some bland dishes got plenty of good ones."
1,"Came here last night (Saturday) for the Reggae/Ska music with a few friends. The place was pretty dead but the DJ was playing rad music and the drinks were cheap! $13.50 for a round of drinks for me and my 3 friends? We're in! The bartender was a really cool chick, too. Thanks for digging out that Red Stripe for my friend. \nI'll definitely be coming back again the next time I'm in town!"
0,"I ordered the Korean Steak Quesadillas. Generous in portion, but sad in flavor. I am a huge fan of Korean style cooking, well aside from kimchi. However, this place realy fell short for me. I was really expecting an amazing flavor from the food. Instead, I was met with slightly seasoned steak. I had a small pile of lettuce, tomatoes, kim chi and sweet and spicy sauce in addition to the three quesadillas.\n\nI really have nothing terrible to say, however, I have nothing great to rave about. It just tasted like an average grilled quesadilla.\n\nBring cash, they prefer it. Very few people pay with card so the line goes fast."
1,The employees are all exceptionally friendly and appear to appreciate my business. It's very nice to be treated so well. The food is normally fresh but the egg white delight sometimes has a crunchy English muffin that seems a little older. This isn't all the time though. Overall I have had great experiences there.
0,"\""Where are the prices\"" my wife asked me when we started looking at the appetizers on the menu. We called our server over and she explained the numbers after the description were the prices, they just didn't include the \""$\"" symbol. Weird, since the entree prices were clearly marked.  \n\nWe started with the summer rolls expecting something similar to spring rolls we have had at many Thai restaurants.  These were very different due to the tortilla like wrapper that was fried crisp on the outside but was tough on the inside. The filling was mediocre and could have used some ginger or basil or any flavoring ingredient. $6 for six small summer rolls is overpriced in my opinion and I would not order them again.\n\nSpicy green beans with pork was my lunch selection and when it arrived I was stunned to see a 1/4\"" thick orange slice as garnish - something I would expect at the Sun City Denny's - but not on a gorgeous plate of peppers, green beans and pork slices. I dug in and found the food temperature barely lukewarm. My entree was nicely flavored with a fairly mild curry sauce and since this was our first meal at Tom Yum I had ordered medium hot and it was spot on for peppery heat. The sliced pork was on the tough side probably due to being cooked at too low a wok temperature thus sweating instead of frying.\n\nMy wife tried the cashew pork and her entree arrived (with orange slice) piping hot, the pork was tender and the onion chunks perfectly cooked.  The sauce was very tasty and the pepper level was just right - medium.\n\nEntree portion sizes were not overly generous but the rice portions were downright tiny: one small soup bowl of rice per entree. I almost chose brown rice for an additional $1 but was very glad I didn't when I saw the skimpy little rice serving."

1,"So you're walking through the mall by planet Hollywood and suddenly it hits you. You're starving. What should we eat? Oh, here's a quick taco joint, that'll probably be ok. If you walk down that path, you'll soon discover that Rockin' Taco is more than ok. \n\nFor just under $10 you can get a few tasty tacos, a side, and a beer.  You pick your toppings as you move down the assembly line style ordering station, pay, and find a seat. \n\nThe food is very tasty for the price point and you can decide to eat at rockin taco, order, pay, eat, drink your beer, and be back to walking the strip in under 30 minutes."
0,I've been here at least five times and the cupcakes have gradually gone down hill everytime I've come in.    The main reason I gave it one star is due to the girl/owner that works there.  She is very abrupt and rude.   She's like that everytime I come in.   I asked her about the cupcake special they had listed on their website and she told me the website is old and they are redoing it and don't honor anything on the website.   I also asked her about some of the flavors and she told me to look at the board all the flavors were explained there.   I will not go here again due to the poor service and cupcakes going down hill in quality and flavor.
0,"Been there 4 times, gotten worse every time.  Definitely don't go on a Sunday, they were out of several menu items but we didn't find out until about 15 minutes after we originally ordered. Service was meh, still up in the air about whether or not we will ever go back"

Because my daughter is a beginner gymnast, and I've seen the experienced tumblers at open gym, I asked if we could do it some other time, as she would be uncomfortable in front of everyone.  Paul said that since cheerleaders have to perform in front of crowds, maybe she should re-evaluate cheer.\n\nSeriously?  Does a cheerleader go in front of everyone and do a cheer they never learned before?  Of course not, they practice in private and perform when they are ready.  Do you know anything about my daughter except I said she was shy?\n\nNot the type of comment I'd want for a potential coach.  Not the smartest business move either...."
0,"I saw the mixed reviews, and thought, let's give it a chance.  It's close, it has delivery, and I might get lucky.  Even after placing the order with the lady who didn't speak a lick of English (and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times), I thought \""Hey, she can't speak English, it must be authentic!\""  Well, that logic fell short.\n\nThe sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while.  I'm not being a snob.  I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices.  As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh.  Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland.\n\nOn the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content!  So here's to my health."
0,"Good Food - Horrendous Pompous Service\n\nWe went to this place and ordered two pretzels and a crepe.  We were watching the lady make my crepe, not saying anything.  The crepe station is surrounded by glass so people can watch.  After a couple of minutes the lady said NASTILY - \"" you can sit down and we will call you when it is ready\""\n\nShocked, We walked a couple of feet away and still watched\n\nThe second lady put two pretzels in two bags and handed it to us, however she forgot the cheese and had to be asked for it.\n\nThe crepe was on the heater and I asked to Nasty woman did you forget to put ham in it.  She insisted she did, and I asked her to check.  Low and behold the Nasty girl realized she forgot and began to tear apart the crepe to add the ham.  I was not pleased with the messed up crepe, however I did not want to make them more upset because you know I am the paying customer.\n\nThey then gave me the crepe and I pointed out they forgot the sauce.  \n\nThis is getting a poor rating because of the above, the food was decent.  If the girls were decently nice I would have given it a three star.  I had to correct 3 mistakes and not once did they apologize for the mistakes or the outright rudeness.\n\nDate of purchase: 11/30/2013\nTime 1020 AM\n\nReceipt Number 546252\n\nThey should be FIRED"
1,"Trying to find a good hotel that fits the budget on a holiday weekend is a very difficult task especially a clean one. We decided between aria and this one and Vdara won our hearts so it was an easy decision.\n\nMy friend, his brother and I got to Vegas at the crack of dawn and were worried about their standard check-in time that started at 3pm. Since we were the early birds, the bell hop told us we might get our room early. So my friend gave it a shot and we got the room early with a free upgrade to a suite which made the holiday weekend a little sweeter.\n\nUpon entering the room, the key is not your standard room key but a card that you swipe over the round disc. Once we got in, there is a bathroom to the right, a dinner table, sink with microwave, a stainless steel fridge, and a washer/dryer. The living room area is spacious once you clear it and use the couch as a bed which is what I did. The room was reserved for my friend and his brother that had two closets, one filled with two bathrobes and one for your clothes.\n\nThe bathroom in my opinion is the highlight of the whole room and why not. In the bathroom, there is a bathtub, and a walk in shower with a place to sit down. Two sinks as well for couples if both are using it at the same time.\n\nVdara is probably not as great as Aria and not as swank as Cosmopolitan but I think it is a perfect place to stay because there is no smoke from a casino."
0,"I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. \n\nFor starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.\n\nImperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons."
1,"I always get the chicken tikka masala and it's always delicious.  The staff is pleasant and I haven't had a bad experience.  The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge."
0,"well, what i can tell you about this location. one word dishonest!\nthis location had many many issues, the service is terrible, the store manager (David) looks nice, but operate like he is in the open market.\ntheir staff is OK and less, service can be better.\nkudos to Abby who make the place better.\nOK, the biggest draw for any supermarket is the produce, here they run like an idiots!\neach produce sitting well over a week in the back (employee telling me this and more!) when it comes out to the shelf, in a day max. two its bad as bad can be.\nthey have so many returns of produce it isn't funny anymore.\nthey have bad apples, mango slice, watermelon and oranges that just sit there and rot and you know when one is bad in a bag then all the bag is bad as well.\nif you buy keep the receipt since you will need it to return it back!\nmilk and dairy products are changing price weekly, chocolate milk went from 2.90$ to all the way to 3.33$ in less than 2 months, that apply to other products as well!\nto me its very simple, the store isn't profitable, so therefore David the store manager increasing the pricing and trying to sell everything that isn't good.\nthat not why i bought membership, that one will cheat and be dishonest and operates location like he is in the open market.\nget your act together there and start treating people nicer and bring better quality products and produce!"
1,Excellent Peking Duck and other dishes. Service is no-nonsense but polite and courteous. Highly recommend if you're looking for a solid Chinese restaurant in China Town.
1,By far one of the best smoke shops in Az. Great friendly knowledgeable service as soon as I walked in. I would recommend this shop to anybody in a heart beat. They have a really good Vape selection as well.
1,"We went here back in October and I forgot to come back and write my review. I'm giving it 4 stars based on my feelings that it was 4.5 or 5 but my hubby thought more like a 3. He wasn't impressed. I actually really liked my cotton candy martini drink - it was very very sweet and pretty original I thought. Try it. The bartender really wasn't very friendly at all though. Our waitress on the other hand was super nice and really cool about us asking questions about the menu. We had a cool booth over by the window which had an awesome view of TI and the Venetian. I enjoyed and liked my food. It was pretty big servings. We had the cheesesteak dumplings and those were yummy. The pretzels they bring out are tasty, too. Being from Philly we didn't think the pretzels or the cheesesteak dumplings were \""that\"" out of this world though. We didn't have room for dessert so we didn't have any.  Overall it was a cool place. They had The Office on all the Tvs, too, which was a plus!"
1,"I can not say enough good things about this resturant. \n\nMy father took me here several weeks ago, for lunch one Saturday afternoon. \nNow, my father loves trying small, locally owned resturants WITHOUT reading reviews on Yelp... so when he picks resturants I am always nervous. \n\nHowever, I was completly blown away by this location. \nI had the chili cheese burger, and the chili was the right amount of spice, and the sweet potato tots were to DIE for. \n\nBut the best, BEST part of this resturant, are the sauces. \n(I had no idea what they call them... something-yokie?!) \nBut I was literally begging them to start selling the sauces to go, because the chipotle sauce of tasty goodness was so amazing. I dunked my tots, I smothered my burger. \nIt was so amazing. \n\nAdditionally, the waitress was bubbily, and fun, and very very attentive. \n\nThis is what a locally owned burger joint should be. \n\nIf I could give this resturant 10 stars I would. \n\nSELL YOUR SAUCES by the bottle! I'd go broke trying them all :)"

1,"I'm not that big into sports, but when my boyfriend convinced me that if I went to a Pirates game with him during our trip to Pittsburgh, I could pick the next activity, I just had to find something completely different from a baseball game haha!\n\nI fell in love with this place the second I saw it. What a great way to spend a few hours! Even my boyfriend, who isn't really into flowers, landscaping, etc. enjoyed himself. It was especially nice to see the different orchids, fruit trees, spice plants, the giant agave, and the butterfly area.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area."
1,"One of the best, BLT's I've ever had. Great find in PHX airport. Friendly & fun staff. You have some time to kill, waiting for your flight, then get here."
0,"Okay so...my first order here did not go well. Ordered from Eat24 and was happy to see a vegetarian section, but there is some lack of communication between the system and the restaurant crew. Both vegetarian dishes came full of chicken. I reported one (did not notice the curry right away) and Eat24 refunded and the very nice manager came by and apologized. Apparently the computer doesn't even tell them it's vegetarian, must be a software glitch. So make sure to be specific and redundant in the order details until its fixed. They say that I will have a free entree next time, so points to them and Eat24 for the refund. They also forgot my coffee but that was dropped off when the manager came by. So while my first order has turned out for me having rice and coffee I expect my next will be better."

0,"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because they have 5 star entertainment there. You get 10% off your tab for checking in on Yelp but they wont give it to you. The staff is rude. I had to convince secruity that I was going to the bar the to close my tab. The DJ came on at 1:20 and they kick everyone out of the bar at 1:30. I closed my tab finally and my discount was declined. I won't be back. I'll go see that band at a different, more customer friendly venue."
1,"Well, my faith in Claim Jumpers has restored! We had a group function today, serving our local support team. Our appetizers came out before our meal and we were given adequate time to eat then before the arrival of our entrees. We were served fresh baked bread along with our entrees, which as a very pleasant surprise!\nWe pretty all ordered the chicken pot pie which came very recommended by colleagues...and it was well deserved. It was very large and extremely delicious!"
0,"Terrible service. Management is terrible to say the least. We got to our room and it was 80 degrees. A maintenance gentleman came to our room and had to make some repairs. We explained the situation to Darrin (front desk manager) and he refused to comp the night even though we slept in 80+ degree weather! Little does he know we review hotel rooms for a living...the BAR will definitely be hearing about this as well as his boss, Gary Austin. Don't stay here!"
0,the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?
1,Great service. Mike was professional and courteous. Best of all they showed up on time. I'm normally navigating a jammed  packed schedule and punctuallity is premium fot me. The price was good and the service was even better. I have found my guys.
0,"I have been coming to this place for about a year now, and generally thought it was pretty good. But I don't know what has been going on lately but this place has gone severely down hill. The service before was okay, never really amazing but not horrible either.\nBut the last experience I had was some of the worst service I have ever had. We waited over an hour and a half after ordering our food, after being told \""it'll be right out\"" three times. Once we finally got our food it tasted old... like it had been sitting out on the counter while they served other people. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be going back. Don't make the same mistake we did!!! Just because they have a cheap 50% off menu does not mean it'll be good! There are plenty of other sushi places around. I suggest you go to one of those."
0,"Heard great things about Taqueria Guadalajara and expectations were high.  The decor and such are quitey basic but you know that going in.  Staff were friendly and service wasn't slow, unlike other reviewers' experiences.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre (my husband used the words \""uninspired\"" and \""somewhat bland\"").  He had sopes and I had tacos.  Prices were quite reasonable, but I won't be back."
1,"Janis Joplin sang, \""Get it while you can.\""  The bargains at Veloce won't last forever.  From $5 drinks to sushi or dim sum plates for $10 in the bar, there aren't many better happy hours in the Valley.  We're Henderson locals, so we're there a couple times a month.  Last night, we visited with a couple from L.A. on a quick get-away.  Carl at the bar is a gentleman and his accommodation to taste is terrific, adjusting my wife's margarita to suit her.  The sushi plates were perfectly adequate for a light meal while watching the NBA playoffs.  No better view in town with an outdoor patio for lounging and viewing, weather permitting.  What's not to like?"
1,"Perfect place for Sunday-Funday in Madison!  Especially when the packers are playing, this pub is rocking.  Great beer/cider selection, good whiskeys, and plenty of free shots for every packers score.  They also do some great raffle give a ways during the game with local meats and cuts.\n\nFood is also amazing; I would definitely recommend the standard burger (just really, really, good beef; doesn't need tons of toppings or sauces), the sweet potato fries are wonderful, and the fried cheese curds with the advocado ranch sauce are a perfect addition."
0,"This review pains me a great deal, as Onda has the chance to be a top contender for my favorite restaurant, but I can't imagine trying it again as it was a very bad experience.\n\nWe made 9:30 reservations to enjoy a relaxed dinner on my wife's birthday after seeing Love.  We walked up to the hostess podium with another couple waiting and no one manning the station.  As the hostess comes back, an older man walks up and says table for two, clearly cutting in line.  She asks if they have a reservation, he says no, and they are sat immediately.  I didn't say anything to the hostess as it was apparent he was cutting and if he was sat immediately, I figured it would be just a minute or two.  She comes back and puts the couple in front of us down on the waiting list, they also had no reservation.  Next I check in with her and tell her we do have a reservation, but she says we have to wait.  VERY ANNOYING.\n\nWhat I believe to be a manager then came to the podium while she was away and offered to seat us, ultimately having to stop in the middle when he saw that there wasn't a table.  Clearly the hostess gave our table to the line jumper without a reservation.  VERY ANNOYING.  He was friendly and professional and set us up at the bar and offered us a free drink (I don't drink and my wife is pregnant) so we just got a simple drink, but the gesture was excellent and we were ready to start over again with Onda.  After a few minutes, we were sat at a nice table and the seats were very comfortable (a bit too cushy for my wife, she had a hard time getting out since she was pregnant).\n\nAs it was, we ordered the two most expensive items on the menu, so expected top quality food.  I had the lobster milanese and can honestly say it was the best lobster that I ever had.  For those who don't like the breading exterior, just don't eat it all :-P.  My wife ordered ravioli, but it wasn't ravioli.  It was basically a flat noodle (as in lasagna) with some cream and seafood and another flat noodle.  I liked hers, but she didn't.  If that was all there was, it would easily be a 4 star experience.\n\nThe part that is unforgivable is that our waiter (Cesar) ignored us after taking our orders.  He didn't bring the food from the kitchen, he didn't refill our drinks, he didn't check in at all.  Worst of all, when he walked by our table, he looked the other way so we couldn't even flag him down.  At this point, the restaurant was mostly empty, as it was 10:30 or maybe a bit later.  Someone else took our plates and we sat there with no drinks and no food for around 30 minutes.  My wife wanted dessert, but was getting really annoyed at the actions of the waiter.  FINALLY, he came by and said \""Is there a birthday here??\"" bringing a piece of cake.  He didn't seem to know whose birthday it was and he didn't give us the option to look at a dessert menu.  Yes, the slice of cake was free, but my wife didn't like it and would have happily paid for something she did enjoy.  She was very upset and not the experience I had hoped for when I am paying over $50/plate.  VERY ANNOYING!!\n\nI still tipped reasonably well under the circumstances (15%) because in Vegas I am very superstitious and didn't want bad karma :-P.  I looked for the manager who was so friendly and the busboy? who had been refilling our drinks and clearing our plates to tip them a $20 directly for their service, but didn't see them.\n\nFor a place with such excellent food that I would love to try again, I can't imagine coming back after terrible, inept service, especially when we were celebrating a special occasion that they knew about.\n\nOnda, please class it up."
1,"My wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans so when we saw the restaurant as we walked the strip we had to stop in.  It was noon and the line was a bit long, however the wait was only 20 minutes. This might indicate that they were churning out customers, however that was not the case at all. We spent time talking to the hostess, waiter and manager, however Gordon wasn't there. We missed him by 2 days.  \nI was hung over so I opted for the Farm Burger which included an egg and duck breast bacon.  Perfect.   We also enjoyed onion rings which were the best I have ever eaten.  My only regret was that I was only able to finish 1/2 of my beer.  30 on tap.  \nThe service, food, prices and atmosphere are excellent for a casual meal.  \nWith so many choices in Vegas to eat its hard to go wrong, however I do not give out 5 stars often and BurGR well deserves all 5."
0,"We had a reservation at 7:30 for a party of 12 for a birthday party. We arrived at 7:20 and were told our tables were almost ready, that a previous party was finishing up at our table. Not a problem. 815 we were still waiting and the manager said she had an idea, she could place a table at the end of the booth, but it was going to be too cramped, then she suggested 2 booths, splitting up the party, which defeated the point of being all together for a birthday party. The manager was nice but the hostesses were very rude and snotty behind our backs as we waited to see if our original reserved tables were ready. We heard the hostesses bad mouthing our entire party, mainly the birthday girl, and were very upset with how they were talking about us with us right there. We addressed the situation to the same manager who was helping us and she apologized and said everyone was on edge because the owner was in that night. Really? I'd hate to see service on a night he wasn't there! About 830 we finally sat down at 2 different booths against what we wanted, but it was late and we were all hungry. You would think that with the problems this far service would be top notch, WRONG! We waited another 10-15 mins before our waitress even came to see what we wanted to drink, then took forever to receive waters, and a bucket of beer. We were right next to the bar, we would have had faster service walking up to the bar individually. We were promised free guacamole for our troubles with the RSVP but that too seemed like it would never come out. Our other table had a little better service then we did from another waiter. Our other table received their food before ours was even ordered, we finally got our food around 915-930, few orders wrong and the birthday girls food was nowhere to be found. Another manager walked by and we had had it at this point. We addressed the food and drink issues and how long we had been there, drinks and correct food came out very quickly after that. But before that our waitress came over and yelled at one in our party who's food came out wrong. She said it was his fault and she asked him 4 different times what he wanted, well why in the hell did it come out wrong then?! The nerve of her to yell at a customer! The original manager came over towards the end of dinner and told the birthday girl she hoped her night got better, laughed at us and walked away. Rudest service hands down. We did get some of our bill comped, but by then it didn't matter, food was cold, served wrong or not served at all, and all by the rudest wait staff in Charlotte. We will never attend Cantina again and plan on making a complaint with the owner and telling all of our experience."
1,"This place brings out all my favorite features of my ADHD.  There are things to touch, see, feel, experience, explore and hear.  You can sit on art.  You can watch videos.  You can make art.  You can learn about history.  You can stand in a room full of Mylar balloons blowing all around you.  You can learn all about how AW made art.  You can be in the exploding plastic inevitable!!!!!!\n\nMy inner beagle is satisfied."
0,"I normally would go to the Summerlin Best Buy but, they were out of Apple lightning USB charger cables so I went to the next closest one which is this store. Worst Best Buy I've ever been to. Workers seem to have absolutely no urgency to help customers. When I went to check out they always ask if you have a Best Buy rewards account, the guy at the register didn't ask so I asked him to please enter my info he said that's a stupid program. I won't be going back to that store ever!"
0,"I was very excited to try this place given the many great reviews. When I called to make the reservation a lovely man on the phone asked me what table I wanted, reminded me to bring a bottle of wine, was very funny and gracious on the phone. When we arrived we were promptly seated. We were off to a good start when they served us a basked of assorted breads and 3 spreads/oils for the bread. When I asked the server what the spreads were he looked at me as if I had annoyed him and quickly rattled off what they were. I actually did not catch what he said, so can't describe them. The salads were very good. The addition of the dates with the balsamic dressing is something I hope to repeat. The server, again with no personality at all, took our orders. We ordered the Linguine allo scoglio and Linguine di duminica. The seafood in the allo scoglio was good and the dish was spicier than expected, but with us that's a plus. I found the meatball and the sausage in the di duminica to be rather bland though. Both pasta dished were good by all means, but nothing that make me what to rush back to this place. I tend to like places were the food and the service are very good, and the server seemed bothered that he needed to wait on us the entire night. I kept wondering were the great guy was that had taken our reservation on the phone. There also were two women who were working and they certainly seemed friendlier. At the end of the night he brought us 2 biscotti with our check. We have a favorite Italian place already and I was hoping to add this one to the list since we live so close to it, but I don't thing we'll be back. Perhaps some of the specialties are the better items on the menu given their high price tag but these basic pasta dishes just didn't make the cut."
1,"Like it a lot!\n\nProbably quite a grown up bar. We headed here later on - closer to 11ish on a Friday night (V-night) and it was pretty quiet. It used to be the old Standard Bar - black frontage and from the outside appeared small but the bar is actually quite tardis like inside. Mix of chairs and tables, high stools and some booth areas which I'm sure would appeal to groups or those on date night alike. \n\nThe gin is the main draw here. They have a list of the common gins they do on a blackboard and with which mixer they should be served - Fentimans or Fever Tree. I had a Caorunn and a Botanist, both of which were very easy to drink. It won't be the cheapest round of drinks - two G&T's were about \u00a310 but very enjoyable. Other gins can be seen on the shelves - Caz opted for a Boodles and they also do Blackwoods gin too which is lovely. We missed on on trying the saffron gin as it had been their launch night the previous night and they were out of that.\n\nNice surroundings - wooden floors, tables and chairs with blue/grey walls. Not overly bright inside but good enough for a late night supping gin. They also do food - didn't see any menus as they'd probably been moved from the tables. There was a bit of an older crowd in last night when we were in which was good to avoid it being too 'hipsterish' and the 80's soundtrack was fab. I'll return to further explore the gin menu and try the food!"
1,"3.5 STARS\n\nFOOD: I love my sandwiches, and Dilly's always satisfies me. The sandwiches are pretty big. I like the Smokey Mountain because any sandwich with bacon in it is twice as good as those without! I think you get a free cookie with your sandwich, not sure though. \n\nPRICE: Around $7 for a sandwich\n\nATMOSPHERE: Nothing amazing, but definitely good enough to sit down at.\n\nSKINNY: For those of you who love your sandwiches for lunch, go to Dilly's Deli and you shouldn't be disappointed."
1,"This place is amazing!  I have been on holidays and non-holidays and I think the holidays are much better overall.  But that is not to say that non-holidays are bad but it is excellent on holidays and above average on other days.  The pricing is rather high but it has quite a few amazing stations to choose from including the standards of beef, american, pasta, salads and deserts.  If you wanted a place to compare it to I would say that Bellagio is definitely the inspiration for this place. And they are definitely comparable.  The only downside to Wynn for me is consistency.  Again if you go on a holiday the pricing is quite high but the food quality is also much higher such as the pure prime rib that they provide during the holidays, and fresh crab legs, and other delights.  \n\nDefinitely recommended if you are in Vegas and looking for something that is Bellagio level of taste and quality."
0,"I don't like this store.  The manager was condisending to me once because I brought a propane container into the store to be filled.  I'm 32, not a 6 year old kindergardener.\n\nThere produces IS good and there is a good selection.  Decent prices on booze too.  Their meats are poor at best.  I only come here when Albertson's, across the street, is out of something."
1,"An oasis of tastiness in downtown Vegas!\n\nEasy to find and park as the parking garage is right above it and cheap at $3.  PLus it is an easy walk to the Smith Center.  \n\nThe menu is seemingly small but confounding as there are so many yummy dishes.  They just opened but I have been there twice.  \n\nI loved the Chicken and Waffles, which I've never tried before and they have killer omelettes and pancakes.  Then there's the Fat Elvis.  French Toast with bacon, peanut butter, nutella and bananas.  So good.  The hash browns had me going until I realized they were crispy on the outside and stuffed with mashed potatoes inside.  Wow.\n\nDefinitely a must stop-by when dealing with anything downtown.  Or just because you want to check out the evolving scene..."
1,"Since I work in Food & Beverage here in Las Vegas(for over 14 years) and have opened my share of celebrity chef restaurants, I always make allowances for the \""learning phase\"" of a new restaurant during the first month or so. Surprisingly though, my comments on what could have been better during my visit aren't about the atmosphere, service staff, or the food. All of those were just fine...and I'm sure will get even better as the restaurant matures. The only serious issue I saw...\n\nElizabeth...If you are going to walk around checking on people's experiences (as you know a restaurant owner should!) make sure you stop and check on everyone....not just the people you already knew socially! You walked past my table (my GF and I) in the middle of the dinning room more than a dozen times without even a glance or smile to acknowledge us even existing...and yet went to every table surrounding us to say \""Hi\"" to groups you obviously knew already! Shame on you because this is \""Restaurant 101\"" and I know you know better!  Making new guests feel just as important as the returning ones is going to be crucial to building business levels you'll need to succeed in that spot longer than Nora's did!\n\nChef....really enjoyed all the different presentations of quinoa! Looking forward to coming back!"
0,"I've been to this place and it'snot exactly my favourite. The food's rotton in the refectory. When ever you ask for a roll w sausage or bacon etc you have to ask for the butter as the butter is not in the prepared roll. They give you a wee scabby plastic knife to butter the roll with as well. In the refectory you are not allowed to take a packed lunch, when i first heard that I thought wtf? If you want decent lunch advice go home then return afterwards."

1,"i love Maxim. from the general mood of the place down to the random Christmas decorations that are never put away, it reminds me of a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants scattered throughout Little Saigon in Southern California, where the owners are originally from. some holidays, they'll take random trips back to visit, so don't be surprised if you roll up and find a handwritten sign saying that they are closed for a few days. the service is always great though, even when lunchtime diners pack the place. \n\ni've been here lots of times but only ever get one dish - the mi (egg noodle soup) but ordered dry style so that the broth comes in a separate bowl. it's something i ate a lot in CA, but have trouble finding in Phoenix. it's not quite what i'm used to, but comes pretty damn close. if you like mi but have never tried it this way, definitely give it a go! \n\nthere are just a few things to watch out for. it's in a small strip mall so you might miss it if you blink. the parking lot can get a bit crowded and making a left turn into the lot is tricky. and for all the Thai tea drinkers out there, we found out they don't sweeten it with coconut here. other than those tiny details, maxim is an awesome place to get a good, inexpensive meal."
1,Very affordable and delicious. From the salad to the chicken bowl. The veggies are fresh and perfect not mushy at all.
1,"I've been to the Morton's in the Biltmore area several times and just loved it. Perfect every time. So when the boyfriend's mom wanted a steak dinner for Mother's Day of course our first choice was Morton's. Although we shouldn't have strayed from the Biltmore location.\n\nI'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.\n\nThe reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if \""everything was okay.\"" I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.\n\nThis location also feels much more casual than Biltmore's. I guess I'm old fashioned but when I go out for a steak dinner I get dressed up. Many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.\n\nNext time we're craving a Morton's steak, we'll be heading back to the Biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service, every time."
1,"I made an appointment online the night of a heavy downpour that really started to come in at the damaged roof area.  I selected to be contacted ASAP and indicated PM as the best time to call.  They got back to me the next day at around 1:30pm, asked me questions about the damage, answered my questions and scheduled  an appointment.\n\nThe pricing was tough but for the quality of service and craftsmanship they provided, I think the price was an excellent value.  It's been over a year and a half and I've had no leaks or issues with the repairs.  We've had some pretty bad storms in the past year and everything's held up.\n\nI would recommend them to anyone looking for quality roof repair."
0,"This place represents everything I loathe in the lad culture. It's chavvy, it's generic, it's cheap and it's really not my thing.\n\nThere's not much more I can say really.....personally, it;s a total miss. But it might be different for you..."
0,If I could rate it any lower I would!  My wife and myself went in and were seated after checking our menus we waited for our server and waited and waited. I tried to get one of the wait staff and watched two other groups get seated and then get their drink orders. After 10 min we just got up and left..we walked by the hostess and she just watched us go.  Never again will we go to this hooters
1,There's lots of good things to say about this cafe.\n\n1) Small but lots of seating. Cozy.\n2) Wonderful espresso\n3) Nice baristas\n4) Very convenient location\n5) Prices are competitive\n\nReminds me of cafes that I used to visit a lot when I lived in a smaller city.  I defintely recommend!
0,"After eating at Landry's in Orlando and figuring our poor experience there was just a coincidence I gave Landry's another shot and tested this Vegas location because anything this close to the strip can't be bad, right? Vegas is known for entertainment and food! \n\nWrong.\n\nLandry's is overpriced, overrated and lacks and resemblance of real seafood. I tried the same meal at had at their Orlando location to see if this was better and nope - the same dry and bland taste. The fish tasted like it was just thawed and a salad, my fish and an ice tea ran me into the $30s. \n\nAt par with Red Lobster. No better."
1,Just had to try this place after a ton of awesome reviews.  We went for a late lunch around 2pm on Sunday.  So glad we did because previous reviews have said how crowded it could get.  The ambiance is super fun (staff dressed in Halloween costumes and live DJ).  The music was bumping and the food is truly out of this world.  Not to mention the portions are HUGE!  PLan to take some home...left overs are delicious too.  Thanks for a wonderful dining experience!  Can't wait to bring friends/family here!
0,"Overrated.  Completely overrated.  \n\nI had read about this place in the Stip District magazine, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was so disappointed with the donuts.  I don't understand what all the hype is about.  They were dry and no terribly flavorful.  I got three different varieties.  Definitely NOT worth the price.\n\nWon't be going back.  Ever."
0,This place is horrible with customer service! I have come here a couple times at lunch and they have been packed so the host told me to make a reservation for lunch next time I came. I followed her advice and did just that. I came here at the time my reservation was due and our table was not ready. The hostess was snobbish and rude. I will not return here again. Not worth it. Food isn't that great
0,"Last Thursday I flew to Phoenix on business.  I had a reservation at Hertz.  I went to the counter and completed the transaction with the clerk.  Once she charged my credit card and returned my drivers license and went through all of the rules and restrictions, she announced that there would be a minimum wait of 45 minutes as there were no cars.  I heard several other clerks announce this to waiting customers who like me, had completed their transaction.  I had a meeting within an hour and was quite frustrated.  The clerk said she thought she could help me.  She (along with other clerks i over heard) suggested that she could get me a car if i wanted to upgrade to a high end vehicle which would cost be an additional $50.00 plus she would give me a 10% discount on the additional cost.  I was put into a position of missing my business appointment or taking the \""deal\"" she offered.  The cost of the rental car was now $200+ for a 1 day rental.  When i went downstairs to retrieve my car, there was literally over 100 cars on the lot.  I couldn't believe what i saw.  How could Hertz have so many cars on their lot, but not have a car, that i reserved in advance by 2 weeks, not have a standard vehicle for my reservation.  I had no time to go back and address this matter so i put a call into Hertz corporate offices the following day.  As of this writing i have not heard back from Hertz.  I would caution anyone renting a car at Hertz/Sky Harbor International Airport that this might happen to me.  There were at least 3 other customers at the time that I was renting a car, that were told the same situation. I felt completely taken advantage of given the predicament that Hertz put me in - either miss my business appointment or end up paying over $200 for a 1 day rental."
1,"Superb food, service, and decor\n\nI'm a fan of TFK.  Everyone in our family likes the food. It's a very nice setting for a meal and deserves some interior design awards. And I feel a tad better about myself after eating there-- as if the healthy menu someone cleanses me more than 30 Hail Marys and Our Fathers.\n\nOur girls usually are stoked to have the Watermelon Lemonade with Almond Butter, Strawberry & Banana Sandwich.  I love the Kale Salad with chicken added.  And my wife tends to go for pretty much anything on the Pizza or Entr\u00e9es menu that doesn't have mushrooms associated with it.\n\nService was the usual attentive standard we're used to.  The girl even had some hiragana tattooed behind her ear, allowing me to inconspicuously refresh my reading skills.\n\nWe'll be back, again.  I still need to try their juice bar options."
1,"I've had the pleasure of dining here for both business and pleasure. The resort itself is simply beautiful, providing plenty of views of our desert playground. Why I adore J&G is that it's not your traditional steakhouse. You have elements of French and Asian which automatically wins me over. The bar area is great for meets and greets before dining to ease any nerves while you nibble over the tuna tartare or cheese fritters. Uh-mazing.\n\nI am a carnivore and the deal breaker for me is always the Rib Eye. They cook it to perfection always and any of the sides will melt in your mouth. The asparagus paired with the risotto is so yummy. I prefer the Black Pepper Condiment with a side of brussel sprouts. But when you have good meat, it's hard to be disappointed. \n\nService is incredible. Attentive, friendly but always at a distance so you can negotiate the heck out of a deal. My biggest pet peeve is having a client dinner where we can't talk business without shouting and have a level of privacy. As for dates, it is very romantic getting to know someone over wonderful wine choices. You definitely have a wow factor dining on the patio catching the sunset. Here's my quip about other Yelp reviews regarding pricing. If you want cheap steak and mediocre setting, go to your chain restaurants. Out of fairness, you can't compare apples to oranges."
1,"Delicious diner food! The coffee was okay, but the food was great! As previously stated, the portions are huge. My sister and I read up on the place beforehand so we knew to share. :) We ordered an omelet, which was *so* good, and ONE pancake - which was also yum.\nDon't be afraid to accept the free photograph you are offered while you are waiting/eating! It *is* free. You can buy a couple paper frames if you want them. We did! And then gave it to my mom as a souvenir. :)\nSince we went in for breakfast, on the way out, we went into the bar area just to see the fireplace. Pretty cool! They let us take photos and walk around."

1,"Had to take care of some stuff in this part of town that I have never had any reason to visit.. On the way home, I spotted this place and had a sudden craving for a Mexican Seafood platter.\n\nMojarra Al Mojo De Ajo: A Whole Fried Tilapia sauteed in garlic  sauce and topped with more garlic sauce. Comes with beans, rice, salad green chile sauce and fresh handmade tortillas. \n\n - The fish was fried perfrectly and tasted fresh from the sea, the garlic sauce was no joke (smothered with Garlic!) and extremely strong but I loved it, the green chile sauce was intensified with spices/heat but did not linger (Very nice!)\n- Rice and Beans were typical and satisfying\n- The Tortillas were Mesmerizing!! There is Absolutely No Comparison with store bought tortillas and their handmade tortillas served here.\n\nCarne Asada Taco: Litlle diced meat, very soft, not much flavor but their red chile sauce, cliantro and onions, especially the handmade tortilla made it a success.\n\nThe Price was inexpensive for portion and taste, Place was decored surprisingly vibrant and server was helpful and kind. Would come here more often if it was closer!"
0,"Food was good but overpriced. There are other restaurants in town just as tasty for almost half the price. \n\nI had high expectations for the Lobster Tail XL and was extremely disappointed. The size, first, and then the shell of the pastry wrapping the custard. It was so hard I could barely chew it, much less finish it. The custard itself was good though. \n\nThe bake shop outside of the restaurant is all I'd ever go back for.  Their cinnamon cannoli's are much more worth the price for their quality."
0,"-Front door greeter was nice and cordial, of course it happen to also be the Store Manager.\n\n-Employee \""Ryan\"" provided cold, robot-like service and was quite condescending too! If you get this guy, then ask for someone else, unless you like that! (IMO, Ryan would be better suited working as a TSA Gov't Worker.)\n\n-Parking was convenient.\n\n-Wait time not too bad.\n\n-Located in the Target/Kohl's shopping center, near the car wash.\n\n-My third visit to this store (whenever I'm in the area), the service is not impressive at this location. \n\n-I always get matched up with a MEAN employee, while I observe the customer next to me being helped by a friendly employee! Inconsistant service. Avoid. :("
1,"It's so nice to stroll around this old pecan farm. You really feel like you're in the rural country side. I love the garden, the towering trees, the shade. It's lovely. \nBest chocolate cake I've ever had is from here. And amazing soup and sandwiches. A little more on the pricier side, but worth it. \nI've been a couple times and have never had a bad experience with service. It's too bad they shut down in the summer. I understand during the day, but in the evening this place would be delightful to have dinner."
0,"First let me say I will never come back to this place and they jacked my Coach sunglasses!! I was impressed upon initially walking in b/c it smelled great. They offer you a free taste of bread as you walk in. My bf went w/ red, white and blue. It was good but not spectacular. I went w/ Coconut Walnut. OMG really good. but the service RUINED it for me. \n\nWe came in for a brkfst sandwich of which they only have 2 options eggs and ham or eggs and bacon - seems simple enough right? you also (acc'd to the paper you write your order down on yourself ) to add tomato or green pepper. Odd combo but ok. mybf ordered \n1) ham, egg, cheese, tomato and green peppers\nme i ordered:\n2) bacon, egg, cheese and green peppers\n\nwell first she came back .. do you want cheese? \nyes.. i circled cheddar.. ok\nthen she came back.... we are out of wheat bread do you want another?\nwell.. yeah (i dont want to eat a bread free sandwich)... what do youhave?\nher: we have xyz and soudough\nme: ok Ill have soudough (my bf ordered white)\n\nwe finally get our order - both were on sourdough I might add.. \nNeither had tomato or green peppers... \nmy bf took his bk and asked about it and she just looked @ him and said well.. what do you want me to do?\nthe BF: he said well can you fix it? \nshe started  um... well.. um.. and um... er... \nfinally my bf just said well can you give it to me on the side? \nHER: yeah that's a good idea. you can see the photo on the side.\n\n\nI walked out and realized I had left my Coach glasses on the table. I went bk in and they were already gone. This was not a place I'd ever go back. After this neither of the girls would look us in the eye. it seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing.. One of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread.. um.. so that means its ok to mess up our order b/c you start your workday early? \nThe fact this place was empty should've tipped us off. As we left there was an elderly couple walking in, I said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are TOO COMPLICATED for them to make and they've been working since 5 (she said it, me.. so this was not an insult, just a disclaimer I was passing along)"
0,"probably really entertaining if you're drunk or on something (like the group of girls behind us). if you're sober and looking for a show worthy of a $100+ ticket, go elsewhere.\n\ni went with a few friends and the four of us all agreed this was a total waste. blue mimes who play the drums and throw paint around. it feels like half the show is them just staring at each other. a quarter is them just walking around, and the last bit is them playing the drums on pvc. \n\nit's a like an extravagant high school production."
1,"Love this place, great games and library.  Great local art.  Oh, the drinks are awesome also.....  my favorite is Evil Monkey,"
0,"Customer service is really lacking in this KFC. They messed up my order and when I called to complain the manager told me  to bring back the old food even if I couldn't come back until tomorrow. Really bring back the old food, I have never heard of such a thing. What happened to the customer is always right!!! won't be going back there!!"
0,Food is Ok but service is very bad.. They do not even give water glass to customer and we have to buy it. I would never go there again.
0,"Pizza is very good, havent tried anything else yet, however their service is just as bad as most new yorkers, they charge 50CENTS for refills! bunch of cheapskates! only on the strip you can get away with that!"
1,Not sure why I have not reviewed Manuel's. We have been eating with them for the past  maybe10 or more years. We eat there at least once or twice a month. Why do we keep returning?\n1. They are always very nice and make you feel they are glad you are there.\n2. The food is good and you always get more than you should eat at one sitting.( We always take food home with us. \n3. The food is priced reasonably. \n4. They are a neighbor hood family owned business and I always try to support this type of business. \n5. There is something on the menu for all tastes. (Some people that go with us like hamburgers.)\nWhen we go there is usually at least 6 people in our group. No one has ever complained about the quality of food. It has always been good. \nThey have always treat us as a valued customer. I often recommend Manuel's to other people.
1,I think this store is best option over Charlotte area for indian grocery. I have been other stores also  on this place but all are very expensive. I would definitely recommend Patel brothers.
0,If you want bland food. Eat here! We decided to try the place due to the great reviews. But the food and service was terrible.  First off we ordered tacos. My tacos came out with one corn tortilla and meat on it. Nothing else. No cilantro or onions. Nothing. So when we asked if there was salsa they said it was in the salsa bar. Nothing in the salsa bar except cucumbers carrots and jalapeno sauce (green spicy sauce). The meat tasted super bland like all they used to season it was pepper. We also got a burrito. Same thing beans cheese and Carne esada. Very bland.  No seasoning. They finally brought us some Pico DE Gallo for the tacos but at that point we were done.  And it wasn't even good. We ordered chips and salsa. We got no salsa and the chips were rubber. So terrible. Will never go here again!
0,"What a huge disappointment. Was really in the mood. First the guy gets the order wrong and is slow to correct the mistake. I order grilled chicken. Seems  simple.\nI have never seen or tasted chicken that looked more like sundries dog turds.\nDry, causing me to choke. You can tell I am loving this place. The man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order. The girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless. Sound good? Took two bites and left. Wondered why I took a second bite.\nSick. They could have cared less. Oh the rice was mushy. Slice of cucumber"
0,"There isn't much that can be said about the general nature of the hotel and casino that has not already been said: As KC D. put it \""Ok, here is where yelp might have saved me.\""  Exactly. Why did I not get help from yelp when I needed it?\n\nOr, as Tatjana G. put it it, \""Trashy people everywhere. Totally cheap, centrally located, adequate.\""\n\nThe first room we checked into (room 507) was so bad, we laughed our asses off. We were taking pictures of the late 70's decked out wall paper, bed, lamp, TV from the 60's, etc. I could seriously not believe it. We paid as much (through expedia) as we could have paid at the Paris, NYNY, or the Stratosphere. While those were not four star hotels either, they have to be better than this.\n\nThe bed was flat out broke. When you went to lay on the left side, you ended up on the floor. It was like a slippery slope down to the floor, not a bed. \n\nWe immediately called and asked for a different room. They moved us (at a $20.00 per night charge) to a \""completely renovated\"" floor, room 923. \n\nApparently, to the Imperial, a renovation includes new wallpaper and bedspreads. That was the only different thing about this hotel room. Same terrible everything else. \n\nAnyway, to wrap this up: There are many other places to stay in Vegas if you need to save your cash for the slots. Others will treat you better, not be smokey and terribly dated, and basically be less of a pile."
1,"Certainly one of the best values in the Las Vegas  area.  A short, but free tour with a free chocolate (or two).   Plus cactus.  With a live rabbit.  \n\nIt is worth going just for the wonderful aroma of CHOCOLATE!\n\nSure, we bought some chocolate on the way out, but it was still the cheapest attraction we visited.\n\nOh, and at the risk of offending my friends from Hershey PA - the chocolate is way, way better!"
0,"Let me start by saying if I could give this dive 0 stars trust me I would!!! \n\nThis by far was the WORST experience I have EVER had. The hostest was a complete idiot the server was sooo rude and the food was HORRIBLE with small portions and I dont eat a lot, so for me to say small portions is pretty bad.\n\nIt took us 30 mins to get drinks... just drinks, then when we finally get our drinks he takes our order impatiently and rolling his eyes while were giving him our order.\n\nWe had to flag different waiters down just to get refills because our waiter was MIA, oh and when we finally get our food an hour and a half after ordering it, its like 10 strings of fettuccine pasta and 2 pieces of chicken!!!!\n\nAfter eating our food we paid our $90 bill and left after being there for 3 hours!!! Please for the love of God NEVER go here!!! Over priced, Horrible service, Rude servers who obviously hate their job!!!"
0,"Me and the wife decided to give this place a try. We came in on a Thursday and the World Cup was going on,it was a bit loud but to be expected. I ordered the dozen oysters, seafood bowl, and chicken fajitas. We washed that down with hands down one of the best red beers I have ever had. \nNow onto the food. The waitress brought us out two waters which we didn't ask for and charged 1.50 a piece for them. The oysters were hands-down the worst oysters that I have ever tried in my entire life. They were not spoiled however they taste like River water smells and they were not cold even though they were served on a bed of ice. The seafood bowl was equally tasting like River water with a bit of saltiness however the broth was completely tasteless besides the hot sauce and salt and I put into it. The chicken fajitas were cooked well there was plenty of chicken fajita and also came with a side of rice and beans however the tortilla wraps or disgusting and fell apart in your mouth while you're eating. \nThe prices are absolutely ridiculous the chicken fajitas were $16 my seafood bowl was 17 ,two beers were seven dollars apiece you could just go and get the same quality food for probably a third or a half of the cost.\nThe only redeeming factor of this place is the furniture inside does have a Mexican island feel and the Mariachi band was pretty cool but the food is utter trash and the level of attention that the workers placed on the customers was also poor.\nI understand the World Cup was going on however these employees are being paid to serve customers but without the customers they would be out on the ass."
0,"I've never eaten at Hardee's.\n\nI've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell."
0,"I would love to give this place a great rating but what happened at the end of the meal won't allow me to.  Good food, good service.  However, we were approached by the bartender at the end of our meal and asked to keep our children quiet.  Keep in mind that the adults had to speak in very loud voices to be heard over the music!  Our children were actually very well behaved (and I would be the first to hop all over them if they weren't!).  It was a very disappointing end to the evening."
1,"I went to GB on Sunday to watch football with some buddies.  The happy hour is fantastic.  There are lots of things to eat and good prices on beer.  I had the slider sampler, which is a steal at $11.  You get 3 pulled pork sliders with cole slaw and 3 burger sliders with pickles and what appeared to be a mayo based sauce that had a little kick to it.  They are served with a good portion of their garlic fries, crispy and the taste of fresh garlic and herbs is heavy, which is a good thing.  I can see why the garlic fries have a solid reputation.  \n\nI'd say the food overall deserved 3 stars.  But, the comfort of the bar and the service bumps this place up to 4 stars.  Fantastic place to watch games, several TVs and if you are sitting at the bar, you can see more than 1 TV easily, so if your game is not on directly in front of you, it's not an issue.  It's a drive for me, but I'll return."
0,"This is my update after giving Jordandal a second try.\n\nThis time round I sampled the nachos with pulled pork which comes with two different salsas and a orange infused sour cream along with the friday night special of pork ribs with bbq beans, slaw, and cornbread. Dessert was a jar of butterscotch pudding.\n\nIt is with great dismay that I can not up-rate my previous scoring of 2 stars.\n\nOnce again I simply did not enjoy the food. I think the chef and I have a very different view on the flavors that jive. I simply thought the sweetness of the pork and flavors of salsa and cream did not compliment each other. The ribs, though fall apart moist, were covered with a dry rub and bbq sauce that I did not care  for and the beans were undercooked and the slaw bland (I could not finish the ribs, beans, or slaw).\n\nI wish Jordandal the very best and encourage folks to give them a try. Perhaps you will like it...? but I can not fairly rate them any higher."
1,"I don't really know where these poor reviews come from - I've been eating at Kiku for years and have never had a bad experience. Yes, the lighting is dim and it's not exactly chic, but the food is excellent. Kiku was where I had my very first sushi, and it's hard for any sushi to live up to it. \n\nThe tuna and salmon rolls are always very fresh with the perfect amount of wasabi and their entrees are great, especially for those who don't like sushi or even Japanese food. And one of my all-time favorite foods is their tempura ice cream, with its sweet buttery tempura crust and fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Mmm. Delicious."
0,"The food is a sold 2 stars.  It's not horrible, but it's not exactly good.  The banchan is a solid 3.  The potatoes, bean sprouts, and cucumbers were good.  The kimchi stole the show and was by far the best item I had. My veggie and beef soup was just okay.  Maybe I should have gotten something else.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad... but it wasn't great.\n\nThe service was about a 3.  The woman was actually friendly in a stand offish kind of way.  With all of this said, this is the best Korean place I have been to so far in Vegas-- this is no K-town in LA or even Buena Park in OC.  That much is certain."
0,This buffet is well known for one thing. The worst buffet on earth. It even has a bad odor. You will be hard pressed to find anything that looks worth putting in your mouth.
0,We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.\n\nWe will never return.
0,"I'm quite keen on service. Their service here was horrible. Maybe I could say bad timing for me, but regardless of time, it was still horrible service. Walking in, do find my own seat? I guess I do since there happened to be servers running to and fro and perhaps avoiding newly arrived customers. Whatever the case, I went ahead and pulled myself a chair. \n\nWaited quite a bit to finally get an order from a server, but I think at this time, I was already fed up with bad service. Fast forwarding from bad service, the drinks were all right. Tasted better. \n\nStill on the hunt on finding a nice place with decent service and serves delicious tea. If anyone else has, let me know."
0,"This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, of which has dents and scratches all over.  One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.  It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle.  I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle.  I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed.  The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more.\nRichard... Thanks for your response.  RR 543397190 has miles out 66,900 (9/21/14) and miles in at 67,054 (9/27)"

1,"My family and I went for breakfast and I thought the breakfast menu could be a little bigger but they have what you need to be satisfied. I had the chilaquiles , my husband had menudo and my mother in law had a sweet tamale and menudo as well. We ordered tamales to go oh and we also had coffee and the coffee is the type that is cooked in a pot and spiced with cinnamon.Will be going there again!"
0,"I started going here years ago thinking I would avoid being ripped off at the dealership, and Jack (the head mechanic) seemed nice. Well, I was wrong, they are as full of it as the dealerships! Jack was insisting I needed fluid changes that were in the $300-500 range on a 3 year old vehicle with less than 30,000 miles. He came up with an impressive list of what I needed to have done. I expressed to him that if it wasn't necessary, I'd prefer not to due to financial strain at the time. He insisted still that it was mandatory and needed to happen ASAP. So I found a mechanic in Tempe highly recommended on Yelp, and he did one of the services for half the price Jack quoted. The mechanic did the service and then stated it wasn't even necessary, and had he known, he wouldn't have had his guys do it in the first place. I told him about the rest of Jack's list and he stated that NONE of the things were necessary on a new car of my make and model with the low mileage I maintain. I was furious to say the least. Turns out Jack's another wolf in sheep's clothing...and it makes me particularly angry because after 3 years of regular oil changes and asking me for a ton of money, Jack never could manage to remember my name or my car. Horrible customer service. I highly recommend Gene's Auto Worx in Tempe...he's HONEST, straightforward, and doesn't take advantage of women who aren't knowledgeable of what a car does and does not need at certain points in the car's lifetime. I have a lot of interests, that is not included....I need someone I can trust. Go see Gene."
0,My nails chipped the next day. Gel was cracking. In after she did my nails they were very score but I think it's because she didn't clear the critic from under the nail. It was not busy so I don't know why she did a half job on me. Will never go back... Wait the pedicure was good but who wants to go to two different places to get their feet and nails done
0,"Like my first drunk sex experience- forgettable! This was public highschool cafeteria-grade ungoodness. \n\nThe only reason they got a second star was that the service was excellent (Cindy, originally from Montibello, CA, was an absolute darling), and they use real maple syrup for the waffles. \n\nEverything else....... prefer to pass. \n\nMeh to the max."
1,"very good coffee, quick service, and a lot of selection.  THis was a great coffee stop at the Phoenix Airport."
1,"I had high expectations of this place and they were met and possibly exceeded. It's been on my radar now since the pre-fix valentines menu. FINALLY got the opportunity and I jumped on it. \nIt is at the corner of a strip mall with a great not too big, not too small interior. We came an hour before closing so there was not much traffic and we were treated with superb service. The chef also stopped by to make sure we were happy. (love when they do that)\nBetween 3 of us, we ordered chicken marsala, shrimp and salmon scampi, chicken alfredo, lobster bisque, and the chicken wings appetizer. \nI was very pleased with everything, however I do prefer my bisque with a tad more texture. It was a bit runny. That would be the only thing I'd skip on next time. The salmon was one of the best ever. Cooked to perfection! My daughter killed the alfredo, it also was homemade and yummy. \nTowards the end if you want dessert., there is no menu. You just go over to the case and pick one. I was confused on the unique style desserts they offered. The chef was so sweet, he offered to take all 3 types of baklava, cut in small pieces of 3, so each of us could try them all. \nBased on the hospitality alone I would return here. The fact that the food rocks, just an extra plus. \nPS: parents with ones 6 and under, totally cool play area for the kiddos!"
1,"Been many times to Vegas and finally, I found a bar with A LOT of craft brews! Eat your heart out Yard House! This is a fresh new experience on the strip, and what separates them from the Yard House was not the beer, but the service! I came to the bar at the end of our first friendly waitress' shift.(She had a blonde streak in her hair but didn't catch her name) The next waitress to take care of me and my crew, Heather, was equally as friendly, yet another bar tender, Tim, seemed to just want to hang out and tell me and my friends the stories behind the beers we were drinking!  (Not in a creepy way, nor did he didn't ignore his own customers). I had a beer from Kenya, my girlfriend had one from Singapore, and my friend had one from Ireland we all never heard of. Tim sold, through his story, my friend the Irish beer. Service aside.. They have many beers from the states, as well from around the world. Currently, and as a fun hobby, I am making a beer top table, of the different beers I drink. Normally I receive awkward looks from bartenders on requesting the bottle top, but every bartender here embraced my request, and it seemed like they were actually having fun finding and looking for tops. The next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely come back to the Tag."
0,"This place sucks...... no seafood..... service is not great and people are not too friendly.after asking the waiter if they offered any seafood at all he just replied with\"" you have the menu,read it,I will be back\"""
1,"Everything was very, very good.  As it should have been given the price and Bobby Flay's reputation.  I was hoping to be blown away and that didn't happen....but there is nothing wrong with very, very good.  I had a margarita of some sort, the blue corn tortilla with duck, and the pork tenderloin. Two of my medallions were cooked perfectly, the one of the medallions was a bit over cooked...but luckily that was my last medallion and I was already stuffed.  Overall, great staff, great atmosphere, and very, very good food.  I'd go back."
1,"A girlfriend and I hired Dianne for our \""hot mommas\"" birthday party. Dianne did an AMAZING job. She painted all of the children's faces, then all the moms. Most of us had images from websites we wanted her to recreate (think Cirque du Soliel) and they turned out better than the original! We got  a lot of attention when we went dancing. Very talented. Awesome personality. We'll be calling Dianne again."
1,"An incredible place to go for breakfast (I have only been on the weekend). Make sure you are ok with waiting to be sat, there is always a waiting list (20 to 35 minutes). The food is cooked with love and the Red Velevet pancakes and kahlua  egs benedict are both incredibly memorable. When a place like this can consistently deliver me eggs benedict with slow roasted Pork on it and the english muffin is crunchy every time it's impressive. As is the fact that the RV pancakes are more like a pancake then a breakfast sugary cupcake you will wish you got 2 orders. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the wait to sit down. Not sure if that is fair so consider this a 5 star if you are less of an ass#$(* then I."
0,"As a bonafide half mexican-american hahaa..I want 4 things from my carne asada 1.grilled charred taste  2.tenderness  3.a hint of citrus  4.proper accompaniments\n\nAmerica's carne asada is NOT the best carne asada in Phoenix, not even today, on National Taco Day.  \n\nNo need for anyone to suffer the same disapponting let down, not to mention the total rip-off, that occurred tonight.  Spent $3.50 on a bottle of mexican Coke and $1.50 on a can of Coke.  $5.00 on drinks at a freaking taco shop is ridiculous.  I will say America's carne is tender and has the charred grilled taste, but that is where it ends, INCOMPLETE.  On a good tortilla, they serve their carne tacos with a stingy 1oz of salsa (not hot), grilled onions (wtf), guac, and lettuce (again wtf).  You have to douse it youself by squeezing the entire life out of your lime half, and even then it doesn't have enough flavor.  The meat is lacking its perfect marriage to sharper onion flavor,cilantro,hotter salsa.\n\nThat being said, don't go to America's, please.  Let the weirdos who think this place is the greatest support America's.  Oh and they also let people smoke on their patio...MMM smoke and weak carne in my mouth was tasty..nooot.  Trek about 7 miles north and you will find the best carne asada in Phoenix.  Funny how the restaurants that actually have the best carne asada in Phoenix are on the same street, yet are way out of the imaginary ballpark, of great carne asada that America thinks she is in.  Go to 7th Street & Mountain View.  Mountain View is just south of Peoria Ave.\n\nBest carne asada street tacos = Tacos Jalisco (nw corner)\n\nBest carne asada burrito = Vaqueros (sw corner behind CircleK)\nPERIOD"
1,"One of the best bean and cheese burritos ever. Great salsa verde. Drove through after work two nights in a row (after the first night I was hooked.)\n\nI was skeptical at first, but they are friendly folks who know authentic Mexican cuisine. \n\nSuper bomb burrito! I bet the rest of the food is pretty darn good.\n\nOnly downside-limited English so if you have a lot of questions or need custom orders you're kinda screwed."
1,"Nice friendly service.  Its a family owned business and the people seem rough and rude but once you get to know them you realize it's just their strong personality.  They have the best wings in town and my whole family have been coming here for the past 16 years.  I have tried other places but nothing beats the wings here, not even buffalo wild wings which to my opinion not so good.  Family from out of state either come here to eat when in town or ask me to take them some when I go visit."
0,"Let me first say, that I have worked at a zoo and my entire educational life is devoted to animal behavior and physiology, therefore my critic of each and every animal park I visit is a little more intense to say the least.  Firstly, this is a private owned zoo and I know a few people that work or have worked here and believe me the so tires i hear is not pretty, but that is another story entirely.  This chapter is about my visit to the park.  I tried to leave as much bias judgement aside, since my girlfriend was with me and I didn't want to ruin the trip for her (well she told me not to).  The Zoo itself is well organized, clean, and can experience everything in one day. Here's the bad news; all the mammal exhibits are incredibly boring and small providing almost no enrichment for the animals.  The reptiles exhibits are extremely out-dated, albeit they are a wild selection of herps; their exhibits make me feel depressed for these animals.  This is a zoo that shows really easily that ones an area is built, it is no longer taken care of, instead just building on the next big thing.  There is a shining star in this review however, the aquarium is nice, they need more variety (there predator room as green iguanas in a huge enclosure.. GREEN IGUANAS!! HERBIVORES in a PREDATOR AQUARIUM!)..ugh pardon me... Given the small amount of choices you have to visit here in arizona, they do have penguins (oh yeah).. this aquarium severely trumps az sea life and any other faux aquarium we may have in this state.\n\nin conclusion, i ranted too much.  It's a zoo, go outside, visit it, enjoy nature and see cool animals.  Downside..there are many many many many better zoos out there."
1,"I always enjoy eating family style with a group. That's the way to do it when you visit Blue Nile. My first visit was a few days ago, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Luckily I went with some people that knew what to get.\n\nWe ordered a platter with some meat in the middle, and vegetarian sides around the outside. You eat by tearing off pieces of this spongy bread they serve with the food, and grabbing what you want off the tray with that. The food was simple items that were liberally spiced. \n\nI enjoyed my experience, and would gladly return."
1,"Let me start out by saying if you go to Carmine's thinking your eating at a Mario Batali type establishment, well then sure you'll be disappointed.   if you go there however, thinking you're going to a casual, fun local bar with an Italian menu, I have no doubt you'll enjoy yourself.  \n\nCarmines is an interesting juxtaposition of sports bar and restaurant.  I love sitting at the bar and grabbing a couple cool suds on a hot night and exploring their tasty and simple menu.  One of my absolute favorites is their greek salad.  Its nothing fancy but is chocked full of fresh veggies and tasty feta cheese.  If Im feeling a bit more ambitious, I'll sometimes venture over to sandwiches of which I really enjoy the eggplant parmigiana.  Its huge and topped with tasty marinara.  The fries are nothing amazing but always come hot and crisp, which for most restaurants is a challenge.  I also really enjoy their various pasta dishes.  The kitchen staff understands the concept of al dente and the portions are generous.  My only complaint is their pasta trends a little on the pricey side whereas I find the other sections of the menu (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) very reasonable.  \n\nThe bartenders and servers are always accommodating and as an added bonus the video poker machines at the bar seem to payout better than some other local places.  Overall, Carmine's is not reinventing italian food nor are they even claiming they have the best stuff in town.  What they do accomplish is simple, delicious Italian in a sports bar/restaurant concept that is usually dominated by the same ubiquitous fare like chicken fingers or wings.  \n\nIm thrilled to have Carmines in the neighborhood.  Id probably be thrilled to have a Batali place in the neighborhood too, I just couldn't afford to pop in as much as I do at Carmines."

1,Great place for quick pho take out!  I love the fresh spring rolls and the Thai Iced Tea!
1,"Friday lunch with the wife and we wanted to try something different. Looking to stay on the healthy side we opted for Preto Cafe. Just off of Trop on Rainbow it's in a small area of businesses. I looked at the menu online before going and decided to split a veggie sandwich. When we got there we noticed a salad bar with different healthy options, some with fruits, some with cous cous and some with a mix of both. We had the sessional special salad with seared ahi, avocado, tomatoes, quinoa, tomatoes and a vinaigrette. It was so good and I wanted more but didn't want to over do it. The veggie sandwich was equally good. It is stacked with roasted eggplant,roasted peppers,olive tapenade, and some other veggies. Just recently started eating eggplant and this is one sandwich I would order again. The prices are a bit on the high side but these are fresh ingredients so to me it's worth it. Service was on point and all the staff said hello, went out of their way to greet every customer."
0,"ehhhh.  Compared to their cousin, \""Charlie's Down Under\"", this place stinks!  The food quality and quantity is skimpy and cheap.  My BLT literally consisted of two pieces of microwaved bacon and I had about a dozen loosely gathered fries on my plate.  Last time going there."
1,I love going to this place to get a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. The prices are great.

We had a real good time. \n\n I had the Pisco Sour as my cocktail, the petite lettuce wedges, filet and mash potatoes.

0,"I thought it was over-hyped for what  I spent and received service wise. I was overall very disappointed. i went there to celebrate my BF's birthday and told the hostess it was his birthday, then told the waitress, and even told the water guy....and my BF still DID NOT receive the birthday dessert. :( I ordered sweet potato tempura and a king crab California roll and could not believe how dry the rice was. I get a better California roll at my local place back home for a quarter of the price. When we finished eating, it took them 30 mins to bring us the check!? I was so annoyed at this point. I always tip, but in this instance i did not. I did explain on the receipt why I didn't tip too. For how much hype this place gets I am sad to say I was not impressed."
0,Meh. I've experienced better. The staff is friendly. Just basic chinese food.
1,"I just cant help myself, I love farmers markets. In California I was spoiled with choice and amazing produce... really anything my little heart could desire was there. Here its been only getting better and better. The meats, cheeses, produce, breads, food, beer, chocolate, etc. Its all of the highest quality and taste! \n\nWe try to go every Saturday. Its not cheap, there are definitely items that you look at and think, yeah right, thats not happening mate! Like, last Saturday I saw some Italian sausages (why on earth is it so hard to find Italian sausages in this country!??) anyways, these sausages cost \u00a34.76 and there were only 2 of them! Yes, they were pretty big but not big enough!!! But, we did find some beautiful Aberdeen angus burger patties (4 of them) for a wee bit over \u00a34. Now, that is perfectly reasonable and in fact quite a good deal!! The burgers are fantastic and the sellers rear the cows themselves! There is nothing like buying your food from the farmers themselves! \n\nAlso highly recommend the Clyde valley tomatoes!!! Really the best tomatoes I have had since moving to the UK and they have started making their own pickles too!! They are well scrumptious!  All the bread and food stalls are also really good. You can find all kinds of treats from: olive rosemary focaccia to german dark rye or wonderful sourdough and pretzels! There are also some amazing brownies lurking around! \n\nActually, there are way too many lush and delectable treats to mention here! I would recommend going and having a wee wander for yourself, its so worth it!"
0,"Came here kinda late (9:00pm) waited in line for almost an hour.  There was still a lot of people behind us in line.  Food was good, not exceptional.  But for $45/person, including kids, they should not have taken the food away around 10:00, those poor people behind us in line probably didn't get much food to eat!  Wicked Spoon, Wynn's and others are better, for less!"
0,"Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables.

0,"Always bumpin' the music, and I can hear it right as I step out the elevator. They play some good music though. \n\nMajority of the population there = people over 40. \n\nYou sit yourself down, wherever there is an open table/seat..and wait for service....however long that may be. 5 minutes later, we finally saw a server, and had to wave her down ourselves. \n\nI ordered a Bloody Mary, and bf got I think Jameson on the rocks with a coke back. \n\nMy B.M was not yummy. I asked ol' girl if I can have some more tomato juice in there. Which she forgot about, so I had to ask again, and she brought out a cup of it. \n\nEven when I put a good amount of tomato juice in the drank, it still wasn't yummy. :/ \nHmm. \n\nThe Spanish olives that they provide in the drink were EXTRA salty as well. \n\nNo gusta! \n\nWent here on Halloween night to get a drink with the parents..service was much better that night."
1,"The Cupcakery is amazing!!!\n\nI was in Las Vegas with my family recently and we were on the hunt for cupcakes on Christmas Eve. Thanks to my handy dandy yelp app, we found The Cupcakery, and it was definitely a lucky find!\n\nFirst of all the shop is adorable, it's bright and full of character. The staff was awesome and extremely helpful. They were really patient with us as they explained their menu. They have a box of fresh samples and they give a generous sample size. \n\nThey have lots of different cupcake flavors, many of which were decorated in the holiday spirit. Some were so pretty that I didn't want to eat them....but of course my family and I did. We ordered a dozen cupcakes: Red Velvet, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, Brown Derby, their Chocolate and Vanilla Cupcakes, and a Cucumber Chocolate Chip cupcake. I tried the Red Velvet, Brown Derby, and Cucumber Chocolate Chip and I thought I hit the cupcake jackpot. They were moist, delicious, just the right frosting to cupcake ratio. The frosting complimented the cupcakes perfectly with the right amount of sweetness. \n\nGreat cupcake place! We will definitely keep this place in mind."

0,Nobody likes a long wait for food and soggy fries :-/
0,"I hate leaving bad reviews, but I feel I must, in this case.  I will absolutely never eat here again. \n\nI've eaten at this location with my mother several times, as she enjoys talking with the  owner's family, who are from the old country (Italy/Sicily). I've never been terribly impressed with the food, and the spuds/fries are just awful. \n\nI hadn't been back for over a year, and I was nearby and decided to give the place another chance. Big mistake. I ordered one of the cheeseburgers and went to take a bite when I noticed tiny green flecks in the interior of the bun. I inspected the bun more thoroughly, and saw a larger (about 1/4 inch diameter) patch of light green mold. \n\nI called my server over and informed her of the problem and that I would not be paying for the meal. She was very apologetic and offered to replace my meal with something else from the menu. My appetite was gone at this point, so I elected to leave. As I was gathering my things, I saw my server showing the manager (one of the managing family) my burger. The manager actually said to my server: \""I don't know what that is, but it isn't mold.\"" \n\nReally? I know what moldy bread looks like when I see it, and I'm sure as heck not going to eat it!! I just hope that the manager didn't take my bill out of the server's check."
1,"After rafting at the USNWC, I was craving some OTB chips and salsa, so we had a late lunch on the way home.  We found out OTB has drink specials on the Brunch menu, but those end at 2pm so try to stick to \""normal\"" lunch hours on the weekend to get the best bang for your buck.  That being said, the lunch menu is active until 4pm and it includes some discounts on the normal dinner entrees."
1,"BOUchon = BOUrgeois... talk about fine dining... Bouchon is simply amazing!\n\nOn our company trip to Las Vegas this weekend, one of our planned activities was a dinner at Bouchon. There was about 20+ of us, so unfortunately, we had a set menu but the menu was the best of the best they can provide! \n\nFirst course - Corn Soup + Salad. I had the corn soup and I must admit it looked like a full bowl of mustard. Let me just say - it was quite simply AMAZING!!!!!! There was not one person in the house that didn't love it. \n\nMain Course - Steak / Salmon / Chicken. I had the steak and that, too was just decedant! The mashed potatoes were great, and the carmalized onions served on top.............. Ahhhh to die for! \n\nDessert - Caramel Custard or Lemon Tart. I had the caramel, it was good but not my favorite but don't think too much into it as I usually am not a dessert fan. \n\nLastly, to end the evening... we had ABSINTHE DRIP. Yes, the alcohol that is illegal here in the US. It tasted awful, but I did it more so for the experience. \n\nDefinitely try Bouchon if in Vegas, but most fitting for a special occassion (anniversary or birthday, etc). You can thank me later..."
1,I went Monday and I love going after work. I got my eyebrows waxed and a fresh gel overlay. I had to soak off the acrylic off my nails. The technician actually took the time to do and didn't damage or hurt my nail beds like other salons do.  My nails came out perfect and I'm happy. I'll be returning again.
1,"Nice sushi. Small building. Not designed for large groups. I went with a group of 7, and had it not been a Wednesday night, I'm sure we would have had to wait a long time. As it was, we waited about 30 minutes, which I think is totally acceptable. Because it is small, and packed with people and tables, the place was very loud. It is also BYOB - so make sure you pack some!\n\nAbout the food - we ordered A LOT. Appetizers, salads, soups, hot entrees, sashimi and a boat full of sushi. Everything was tasty. My only complaint was that all of the food arrived at once. We didn't have any room on our table to hold everything, and I would have preferred to eat in courses, even if they were ad-hoc courses. \n\nI love the \""neighborhood hang out\"" feel that Hana had. There were obviously many regulars, and it felt friendly and casual. If it was closer to my house, I would certainly return, but I don't think it is remarkable enough for a long drive (for those in the east valley)."
0,"I was looking forward to the shows after reading the reviews, boy was I disappointed. First, right after you get seated 2 guys come over to your table and try to sell you DVDs, T shirts, programs etc.. for about 5 minutes. I was annoyed, but thought oh well show will start soon.  Frank came out as Joan Rivers, which was funny and had good jokes. This was the best part of the show in my opinion. The Divas all performed and I was disappointed, they did not dance good or lip sync good. It was like I was in a karaoke bar, not worth paying for at all. Most did not even look like the stars, Liza was a little short guy and Beyonce a very very large guy. They male dancers were all in good physical shape but they did dance in-sync with each other, I thought maybe it was their first night performing together. Then when the show was almost over Frank came out and tried selling all his items again for about 5 to 10 minutes, way too pushing for a show I just paid alot of money to see. Like I was in a timeshare or something. \nThen when you are exiting the show they line up on each side of the isle yelling at you to buy their products and squeeze the isle down to one person so it is really slow getting out. I would never ever see this again or recommend it. Very unprofessional and annoying. My worst Vegas show by far!"
0,"I wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it. \nThe place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday. \nBut the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again."
1,"Dropped by here to watch This is The End.  The theater was huge, the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable.  I will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area.  Also, this place has bowling, pool and eateries.  Give this place a try if in the area."
0,"The woman had family visiting from Switzerland, so they decided to Vegas it up.  We visited the Miracle Mile shops while her Aunt struck it big at some slots.  She decided to treat us for a meal and Cheeseburger Las Vegas, aka Cheeseburger At the Oasis was the recommendation.\n\nSeating was prompt and the ambiance was cool - pseudo Hawaii/surfer/L&L/Ultra-Hawaiian look...which for me...is blehh..

I also had the notion to be adventurous and perhaps try a DIY Golden Bowl (http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-bowl-charbroiled-teriyaki-6-long-beach) style burger:  Their cheeseburger with Avocado and covered in Teriyaki sauce.\n\nBUT NO.\n\nWe arrived at 9:00pm, so the night was still young (and this was a Thursday).  Explain WHY the waiter had NO gusto in his service and not happy at all to serve us.  I WANTED to try the DIY burger, but when he came to me his respose :\""{sigh}..what did you want...{frown/look/awkwardness}\"".   My response dropped from a full fledged custom burger to \""the alili burger\"".  He doesn't acknowledge me and walks off to the other member in our party.\n\nBeing Vegas, I would have thought that I could have a \""Vegas Burger Experience\"" - ie meat cooked the way I want it, toppings the way I want it, dressing and sides the way I want it, but I guess this wasn't burger king:  I couldn't have it the way I wanted it.\n\nWe sat and waited...and waited...and waited.  Drinks came out, their iced tea tasted like water...something was wrong with the mix I suppose.  We brought it to their attention, but instead of fixing it or trying to see what was wrong, our waiter simply said \""This is how it is\"".\n\nLovely.\n\nWe waited...and waited...and waited.  He never showed up until our food came out (1 hour later....really.   The woman's family were still in conversation.  They mentioned the long wait, but I was really hungry and did notice).  \n\nThe food was awesome.  I can't deny it.  The burger, even though it was cooked on the medium well side, it was good.  I preferred a bit more pink, but i wasn't given that option.  The cheeseburger was done well.  I could careless for their coleslaw actually...i didn't taste any dressing on it, and it seemed as if they wanted the pineapple taste to come through into it...but I didn't get that flavor on my palate.  \n\nOverall:  The food, although EXTREMELY long on a Thursday night, was worth the wait, IMO.  I would have appreciated better customer service, because lets face it:  It is apart of the dining experience.  This is the main reason as to why I did not give it a 3 or four stars.  Simply put, as the 2 stars state \""Meh.  I've experienced better\"".  \n\nHad the waiter been more friendly and explained the menu, I would have opted for the Cheeseburger Challenge, as my burger was small.  (And I could have gotten a tshirt!).\n\n\nIm confused though.  The guy seemed like a total douche...but offered us free cups as we left for the Cheeseburger: Reno location.  Im guessing they had closed down or something and gave the cup for free.  The woman used her charm and asked for another cup, which he smiled and hesitantly said yes to.  \n\nHad his simple smile then reflected during his service, we could have had 3 stars.\n\n\nAHH and dont be fooled by their \""Cheeseburger\"" brand ketchup in a squeeze bottle.  Its only Heinz. ."
0,"My *last* experience was such a disappointment. Before that, my beau and I were very happy with our past dining experience and dishes, as well as the super cool ambiance. The past Sunday,on top of being sat next to the dirty wooden blinds that trapped two huge flies, my eggs had a blond hair in them - GRODY to the max! No more Zada Jane's for us!"
1,"This is the main branch for the Carnegie Library and it is needless to say, HUGE. \n\nThe place holds more books than you can imagine, and even if they don't have it, you can bet that one of the other branches have it. They'll request a copy of anything that your heart desires and it'll be sent right away. I requested a copy of Steven King's It and it came in around 2 days (don't judge my taste in movies). \n\nI love coming here to study, relax, browse, or even just to hang out with friends.  They don't have a great selection in movies but hey, I should just go read a book anyway."
0,"The pancakes are not all they're cracked up to be, far from, actually. My one star is for the fresh orange juice. I had the saddest hash browns ever, lousy sausage, mediocre eggs and some toast I didn't even care to touch. Could have had the same meal at Denny's for half the price and with better service. On top of that, we had to wait more than half an hour for our meal which of course arrived right at the moment where we had almost decided to leave the god awful place. Unacceptable and below all standards."
0,"Stone crab was nothing special and not worth the price. Steak I had was overpriced, overseasoned and overdone. Service was ok  With so many awesome restaurants in Vegas.  I wasted time, money and a meal here."
1,"Hands down best place to eat in Shadyside.  Here's what you do: Grab a six pack across the street and head over to Chica Loca.  Nancy will take care you (WHAT UP NANCE!) The chips guac and salsas are all fresh. I order all the tacos on flour but you have the option.  The brisket taco is serious.  Although, everything is good and I will guarantee a good meal/good time.  Re-think your destination, especially if you are headed to Steel Cactus for food (mexican around the corner) It is not even a fair comparison.  I love Chica Loca."

0,"EDIT2: They charged my card AGAIN. I have now been charged four times for a one night stay. I've put a charge block on my card. Here's the saga on Vegas Chatter: http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2012/9/4/162713/3521/vegas-travel/If+You+Stay+At+Golden+Nugget%2C+Keep+An+Eye+On+Your+Credit+Card+Statements\n\nEDIT: So, I'm fresh back from my stay this weekend and here's the rest of the story.\n\nA representative from The Golden Nugget called me on Friday and explained their billing software was not jiving well with AMEX and that's why the double charge again. He then told me I would receive $300 off the bill when I checked in.\n\nFlash forward to Saturday (my check-in day) - my husband and I check-in with surly employees at the VIP lounge, go upstairs, have a lovely stay in our suite. \n\nThen we checked out this morning and THAT's where the issues come up.\n\nThe employee who checked me out informed me we were booked to stay until 9/3. I replied to her that we had only booked one night. She then said, \""Well, whoever booked this online booked two nights. If you want to check out today there will be a $50 early check-out fee.\""\n\nI simply replied, \""No.\"" She did some typing and then, lo and behold, we didn't have to pay the fee anymore.\n\nI am utterly AGHAST at the amount and degree of billing errors I have experienced in booking one night with The Golden Nugget. From reading other reviews here, I believe this to be a systemic and reoccurring issue in this casino and hotel. \n\nI'll be calling the number of the gentleman who promised me everything would be fine during my stay to alert him to this. Even though I received a reduced rate, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone give these people their billing information.\n________________________________________ \n\nI wish I could give this hotel NO stars. \n\nThe Golden Nugget has now charged me $530 TWICE for a stay I haven't even HAD yet! Watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information. \n\nThe first time was when I originally booked my stay in July. I noticed a duplicate charge on my AMEX and called them about it. I was informed they had double charged almost everyone that day and were working on getting people refunds.\n\nThey did refund me but then...\n\nOn August 27 (two days ago), I received ANOTHER CHARGE for $530 on my AMEX from The Golden Nugget, THIS time it was filed under \""Specialty Retail,\"" which a customer rep told me meant someone had charged my card in one of their shops. I haven't even stayed there yet, so this means someone has either taken down my info and used my card to charge something or they have a dangerous glitch in their accounting system.\n\nI informed them of this and after more than 20 minutes on hold, I received NO apology, no compensation, nothing. They told me I have to talk to their accounting department. The hotel manager (Roxanne Yun) said they could do nothing for me and that she \""had no knowledge\"" of the SECOND duplicate charge on my card.\n\nBasically, they told me since it didn't show up on their screens (which, why would it? It's not attached to my reservation. It's a charge on my card from an unauthorized purchase in the gift shop.) it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me.\n\nI offered to send them statements, written instructions, etc. and she repeated to me that I would just have to talk to accounting. \n\nAgain, I would not recommend you give these people your credit card information. I'm reporting them to the FTC tomorrow morning."
0,No its not $$. Its way more expensive thsn that!! Go somewhere else that's worth your money!!
1,"I go here often . I have followed them from all the numerous locations in Las Vegas they have been in from Planet Hollywood, Four Queens, and tonight Ballys. They have great comedians most of the time.  Thats why I go back so often.  I also get deals where I can get in either free (Showtickets 4 locals)  or prepaid Houseseats.  Even then, if the show worth going to I wouldn't return.  Not sure what the venue is like at Ballys yet but, Cabo Wabo was small and cozy, I guess you can call it that.  The downtown location was on the dumpy side.  It didnt stop me from going though. I guess you can say its the comedians that bring me back !!!!"
1,"I came here three times in 10 days. That should say something! Not your typical Americanized Mexican-type food. Very authentic, and their carnitas and carne asada grande tacos are fantastic! I also got the carne asada burrito bowl with no rice. The red and green sauce here is far better than many of the other Mexican restaurants I have attended.\n\nThe best thing here is that they appreciate individuals who observe lent by offering grilled fish and shrimp in taco, burrito, and bowl form(s)! Their jalapenos are the best! I love this place!"
1,"I went here last night to attend the show Stars in Concert.  I had been to this theatre about 7 years ago for another show.  The theatre has been changed some since that time and the changes are good.\n\nThis venue is really a great, smaller venue.  There are about 40 round tables on the floor each seating 4 people.  In addition, there are 5 rows of theatre style seats in the back.  I sat in the first row here, and it was very comfortable and I had great sight lines.  Again, it's a small venue so you can see well wherever you are.  The theatre has good sound and the lighting was well done for the show.  \n\nThere's a lounge area with bar before you enter the theatre so if you're early, you can have a drink and relax.  Seating was done promptly 15 minutes before show time.  The employees I came into contact with last night were all very pleasant with great smiles and were very helpful from ticketing to seating.\n\nThe only drawback may be finding the place the first time you go there.  You need to remember you enter a small alley just north of Walgreens and before McDonalds.  Parking is available behind the theatre and it's a short distance down this alley.\n\nA word about the show.  I came to see Stars in Concert which is in its first week at this theatre.  The show was very good.  Rotating impersonators sing live music of famous people.  There was a 4 piece band on a platform raised above the stage.  Last night, there were impersonators of Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, and the Soul Brothers.  All music is live.  There is no lip syncing!  Not a bad show at all.\n\nI'll be back for another show which goes on earlier."
1,"If you like a neighborhood type of coffee shop with plenty of personality and local flavor, this is the place for you.  Even my wife, who isn't a fan of these places remarked that it was a great hangout.  \nI had a latte and she had a hot chocolate.  Both beverages were excellent.   We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Next time we're in town, we'll be back."
1,"It is nice to have a friend that is as enthusiastic as you are about a cuisine. That is what I have found with Katrina M. Being friends for as long as we have, you tend to sync on certain ideology and preferences, for us, that would be Korean food. After coming back to Las Vegas after being gone for two years, my dietary needs and what my stomach can handle has changed quite a bit. For the first month, I was unable to handle all the grease and creamy foods that are so common in our everyday diet. There is a reason why Koreans are so proud of their food, it is healthy and delicious, not something other cuisines can boast about.\n\nSo Katrina M. and I ventured off on our quest to find delectable dishes that would stand up to what I had been eating in Korea. I know everyone says that food in the origin country can never be duplicated and it is true, but Soyo does a decent job none the less. While going over the menu, if I remember correctly; the names of the dishes are in Korean with a brief description in English. This makes it a little difficult to become accustomed to putting a name to what you are eating. If you are not familiar with Korean food already this will provide a challenge if you decide to go to a different restaurant.\n\nThe day that I went, my food buddy left me in charge of ordering. The possibilities seemed endless as my eyes darted to all the Korean in search of my favorite foods. Sadly, a majority of my favorite dishes are not served in any of the Korean restaurants I have visited. It was time to suck it up, stop pouting and order.\n\nWe ordered the kimchibokeumbap, the Korean equivalent to how the Chinese have fried rice. It is simple and an easy way to get rid of an abundance of leftover ingredients. I would say that it was not bad at all, I enjoyed Soyo's version. The only downsides I can find with it was that it was a little sweet and the only distinguishable ingredients that stand out in my mind was the pepper paste and fried egg. It definitely needed a little more variation in texture. I would have loved to see nice chunky slices of kimchi and lavers in it. I don't even remember if they had any in there.\n\nThe second item we ordered was the maewoon galbijjim; a spicy version of a soy sauced based steamed beef ribs. The first thing I noticed was how tender the meat was. It separated from the bone as soon as you scooped it up with your spoon. The aroma took me back to Korea, but that was dashed as soon as I took a bite. There was no kick to it at all. The sweet and savory factor was delightful, but not what I had wanted. It was delicious, but it made me think of a friend in Korea that I had debated with about which version was more traditional. I seceded from that argument with my tail between my legs. I found out that the style that I favored is a specialty of certain regions.\n\nOverall the food is delicious, the kimchi is good, the decor reminiscent of a much cleaner version of what you can find in Korea, the staff warm and friendly, and the music is fun. It was an enjoyable experience from beginning to end."
1,"This was my first time at a Vegas buffet.  It was delicious and had an amazing assortment of food.  For being on a buffet I was impressed with how delicious everything was -nothing overcooked or dry.  They don't let too many people in at a time so I never had to wait in a long line for anything.   \nI had crab legs, oysters, some different meats and yummy vegetable and fruit salads.  They have an excellent cider on tap.  The desserts were really fun and I tried many different ones including Tiramisu and Cr\u00e8me Brulee.  The coffee bar at the dessert line is also included and I had a lovely Cappuccino with Amaretto.  \nI can't speak to price because someone else paid for our party and I never knew how much it was. But really, yum!"
0,"The place is a dump. Very small space. Not friendly staff especially in the check in counter. A/C don't give enough cold air. The place is not pet-friendly & they charge $15 per night for it. No pet area. Smelly bathroom, actually the whole room smells. I will never ever stay here again. It was stupid of me thinking of saving money when this place is a dump. I would not recommend this hotel. Worst hotel I have ever been."
1,"What a unique find! Yummy tapas galore, friendly server, cool interior. It was a wonderful dining experience. My boyfriend & I came on a Saturday afternoon thinking it'd be crowded but we were wrong. We were actually the only ones there which was pretty neat.\n\nWe started off with a Blueberry Lager Beer Float which was delish! Beer & Ice Cream? Of course it was good. Haha. Then we ordered a few tapas for both of us to share. \n\n1. Salad w/ Garlic Goma Dressing-- OMG! It was delicious! I daydream about that dressing all the time, wishing I could have it in a bottle for my own salads at home. It was recommended by our server. So good! \n\n2. Chef's Braised Belly-- You have to try this, definitely. I think there's one that comes with rice but we ordered just the belly. The sauce was sweet and tangy, not too salty. Came with more salad w/ garlic goma dressing, which I was extremely happy about.\n\n3. Gyoza-- They were very unique, shaped like raviolis. Sauce tasted similar to the braised belly, which I didnt mind since the belly was deeeelicous. \n\n4. Ribs & Chicken-- This was actually an entree. Ribs fell off the bone, chicken was tender and juicy.\n\n5. Shrimp Waffleyaki-- My boyfriend liked it. The sauce was spicy and yummy, which really made the dish amazing since you couldn't really taste the shrimp.\n\n6. 28Go Rice-- I wasn't a fan of it because of the seaweed mix but my boyfriend enjoyed it. I felt like it tasted too fishy? Idk, if you enjoy seaweed that way, (not nori topping), then by all means, go for it. \n\nI wish the table we had wasn't wobbly & the chairs were more comfy (back was way too slanted, you couldn't lean back). We were also seated all the way to the front against the hot, boiling sun, next to the window. We were profusely hot! Haha. Place is not completely 5 stars but it has the potential. Will try it again for sure!"
0,Me and my family came here to rent a hotel at the HARD ROCK hotel and one of the workers just came up to me and basically keep wanting me to show my id many times I felt very discriminated by them. I talk to the AFRICAN AMERICAN security or whatever he is he thinks he owns this place and felt an anxiety from him. I felt harassed and discriminated by this place and I don't recommend the Hard Rock to anyone bad customer service and the staff needs to be retrained.
1,"I still can't get over how I paid $2.99 for a coffee and 3 doughnuts! What a deal. I was debating whether or not to go to Krispy Kreme or Winchells but decided on the latter since it wasn't a chain and I could get Krispy Kreme elsewhere... .\n\nWinchell's shares space with Subway which was a little random but I didn't have any problem with it because the woman helping me and what I assume to be the owner were both very nice and sweet. I hadn't eaten doughnuts in a little over a year so I decided to go with a boston creme (one of my favorites) and got a chocolate glazed chocolate doughnut for my sister and a glazed for my friend.... \n\nThey were by no means the best doughnuts I had eaten before, a little doughier than I had expected but it definitely hit the spot. They hadn't skimped on the cream and it oozed out of the doughnut with every bite and I was more than satisfied with my choice. I didn't try the other doughnuts but all my sister said was that it was okay as she scarfed it down. \n\nWould I come back again? Sure, why not. I will probably be back for EDC 2013 next summer so till we meet again Winchells. Keep up the friendly service! \n\nYELP 365: 159/365"

1,"Saw Dr. Richardson on 8/23/13 - I was experiencing some sensitivity in the tooth he did a root canal on two months ago, and was concerned that there might be a problem.  \n\nThe staff was able to get me in right away, and although Dr. Richardson was very busy, he took the time to COMPLETELY evaluate my situation, and reassure me that everything was fine.\n\nI cannot say enough about this business, and about Dr. Richardson.  I have seen both offices, and everything is TOP NOTCH in my book.  They deserve SIX stars, but yelp only allows five, so that is what they get!\n\n5/5 - 100% satisfaction - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"
0,Pizza was not that good. Beer selection was weak at best. The vibe of the place was really bad compared to what it was just after being outside. Waitress even seemed depressed. Wont eat here again and definitely wouldn't go out of ny way to eat here...Good concept gone bad and poorly executed.
0,I went here on a Thursday evening after running around all looking at new furniture. I decided to give it a try. My first thought the service was great. The waitess was outstanding. Well here is when things go downhill. I tried the doubledecker sandwich which is a sandwich with pork on the bottom and beff brisket on top. The meat was ok the bar-b-que sauce was just ok. The fries were cold stuck together. I have had better. Will I go back probably not. But again I think the staff was great.
1,"This was my 4th visits to FF!  It was one of the best time being with Yelpers, yay!!!  Whenever I am in this event, It reminds me of  the town that I used to live in Seattle(Broadway Capitol Hill area) :p   So many things to experience with your eyes; the gallery walk, handmade jewelries, street musicians, dancers, magicians, antique shops, & great snacks of course...  There were many great original art pieces by local artists including photographs that you could purchase with affordable price.  It seemed the dry heat didn't really matter to anyone-a dry heat is more bareable than humid heat to me anyways -.-;;;  I had 2 tasty sliders & a glass of Fat Tire beer with me as I walked through the street event. I had a blast with all the ppl from YELP & love to do it again in the near future!  Oh, we all eneded up going to DCR for Summer Cocktail Drinks~~it was very refreshing!!  Made home safe with one big happy smile on my face :p ***"
0,"My wife and I were trying to decide what we wanted for dinner so we took a drive to downtown. As we were walking around we remember a friend recommended this place. We did not have reservation, so we went to see if they had any open tables. We got there at 6:30pm and the host said he needed to wait until 6:45 to see if any reservations did not show up. So we decided to wait. At 6:40 the host said he had a cancel. \n\nI like to rate my food items on a 5 star scale. The number of * is my ratings\n\nWhat we ordered/items came with entrees: Caesar salad*, NY Sirloin*, Tomato/ pesto stuffed chicken*, dessert plate (we did not eat any of it)\n\nPositives:\nLemon sorbet that is served between the salads and entrees.\nNo ordering of sides separately (also listed on negatives).\nBuild your own salad tableside.\nService for bread and water\n\nNegatives:\nAtmosphere: Very dark, old feeling, and very small place. They have too many tables for the table side service for the salads and desserts. We sat at a table and when the gentleman was preparing the salads for the booths behind us he kept bumping into us.\n\nService: The waiter had broken English so it was hard to understand him. He did not make any recommendations. Right after we ordered the guy came to make our salads. The gentleman did not recommend any salad or describe any of the dressings. We heard him describing everything to the tables behind us after we ordered. \n\nFood: \nSalads- Terrible dressing was very very fishy (anchovies).\nEntrees- First, my steak. The steak seemed like it was from a caf\u00e9 that serves the $1.99 steak and eggs. This was not a steak from an expensive steakhouse. My wife's chicken was something that you could also get at a cheap caf\u00e9. \nSides- This was very disappointing that the sides came with the entr\u00e9e instead of us being able to order what we want. The entr\u00e9e sides were a stuff tomato, veggies, and mashed potatoes.\n\nThis was the most disappointing places we have EVER been to. We have been to many expensive steakhouses and this by far is the WORST. We are locals there are many other great places to eat."
0,"Terrible, terrible service, ....hey.. Thanks Beth!! I'm not coming back. There are too many good restaurants in this area to put up with poor service and management that is to arrogant to make sure their dinners enjoy their meal and evening,."
0,"OK...I just walked back into my hotel room after a meal at this place. I think I'm being overly generous by even giving them one star.  Fact of the matter is I had no choice but to give them one because there was nothing lower.\n\nI had the #5 combination which consisted of one cheese enchilada (which was 1/100th of a percent decent), one shredded beef hard shell taco (which was perhaps the best thing on the plate), and one bean tostada (stale tostada).  I also ordered an overpriced ($7.95) chile relleno a la carte that tasted more like an \""effen\"" omelette.  C'mon now!!! The consistency of the egg covering the chile relleno should be fluffy and quickly fried.  This thing looked like and tasted as if they first made an Omelette and then wrapped it around a steamed chile....the chile wasn't even fire roasted!!!! \n\nFriends, I know real Mexican food....FINE Mexican food for that matter and this place IS NOT IT!  With all due respect to those of you who have written rave reviews about this place and of course to the proprietors, BUT I think I would have had a much better meal at the nearest taco bell, gladly paying the $25 bucks I laid down for a less than mediocre meal.  My recommendation to you all is .....DON'T BOTHER.  They should really consider dropping the \""FINE\"" from the name of this establishment.\n\nOn a good note - The lady tending bar that evening was very very nice and attentive.... unfortunately the service alone can't hold this place up."
0,We were excited to try this place as we have been hearing alot about it.  Lee's smells like a hospital and it's a bit of a turn-off to the appetite.  We tried to get past it and try a sample...the girl gave us barely a speck of ice cream and the bit we got tasted stale and freezer burned.  The girl kept saying you want some ice cream with alcohol? Come on we are adults it's not some big deal to get alcohol...ugh we left ...I give the place only a few months:(
1,Great resort and great pools. They treat their VIPS right!
1,"I really love this little business.  They are true to what real Mexican Paletas are supposed to be - fresh fruit ingredients, no preservatives, all natural with no fake flavors or fake colors to account for cheap ingredients.\n\nI wish the owners the best with this business because I think they are approaching Paletas the way I would - upscale target audience (ie. they are not .99c paletas like at the grocery store) that appreciate the work and ingenuity they bring to the flavors and combinations of their paletas\n\nThis evening, we tried the Cereze (cherries *baptized* and wading in brandy, then mixed with home-made roasted almond milk) and the Zarzamora (blackberries with a hint of lavender) - my sister and I were both on cloud 9 with the flavorings (she liked my Cereza waaay more.... I found hers was equally awesome).  Their price point is 3ish, depending on what the ingredients are.\n\nI will keep being a fan and loyal here, as long as they keep to their clean, natural, creative ingredients."
1,"Venzezia's, Venezia's. My boyfriend and I eat here at LEAST once a week. AMAZING food. We love it. The pizza slices are large and very filling, the salads are just delicious, and the sandwiches and calzones are some of the best ever. \n\nI would def recommend coming here for the pizza though. In my opinion, the best slices are the chicken pesto, BBQ chicken pizza, and the Italian Stallion. Add 6 medium wings and a drink and you cannot go wrong. I must warn you though, the wing sauce is a little bit on the HOT side so if you like things more tame, I would go with the mild sauce. The only place that has better wings is Zipp's (and that's a yelp review for another day). \n\nOne drawback, any extra dressing is 35 cents. But let me tell you, the ranch is so worth it. YUM!"
1,"This hotel was a lot of fun. I love the focus on celebrity chefs. Food was great,,,,, don't eat at the buffet though."
1,Not Only do they make the absolute best donuts and pastries in the whole metro area the couple that own and run the business exemplify the meaning of American small business !!   Go there now. Spend all your money!!!!  Be happy all day!!!!!!
0,I've been to this restaurant three times now.... the first two were very good. However my last visit was not so good. \n\nThe waiter Brian was anything but attentive. The large version of the burnt ends arrived cold. I  finally was able to grab a manager to send it back to be heated as Brian was no where in site. I ordered coffee with cream and he never asked if I wanted a refill... nor did he ever bring the cream I asked him for three times. And he never checked on us or asked if everything was alright until the end of the meal. \n\nThe bottom line.... the food is always tasty (when hot) but the service on this trip was simply horrid. I'm not sure if I will go back.
0,"Maybe the current economy has forced Tacos de Juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food, because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had. We live mere blocks from here, so we felt it was about time we tried it. \n\nThe chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had, as was the relleno batter. \n\nI ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.\n\nWe've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return."
0,"Horrible experience more than once. Gave them a second chance and on another car and same thing. Didn't do work they said they did (alignment).  Did this to my friend as well. Replaced window and tint and the tint was obviously a totally different shade and they said it wasn't. I am not color blind. Like everyone else, my insurance company recommended them. Either they have some hook up going on or they actually are the best available and in that case God help us all getting body work done!"
1,"It's a pretty good CD shop, if you're looking for something in particular. One of my friends released a CD that was only available in the Tesco in my local home-town, but I went into Coda and asked them about it and I had it within 2 days. Great!\nThe staff are really knowledgeable too, and if you want to find something new then this is definitely somewhere to come."
1,"Possibly my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  The tacos are delicious, and the coconut margarita is a highlight as well."
0,"The worst staff you could possibly have for any medically staffed business. Dr ohriner is a  fantastic eye doctor with a great amount of knowledge, but the staff at the front of the  office is absolutely unprofessional and unorganized. I placed a call to the billing department and left a message almost every day with no return call as of yet (5 weeks later). Nothing but the runaround from multiple staff members. Unacceptable!!! I will not be back and that is a shame as Dr O. has been our doctor since 1994. I attribute all of the other negative comments about wait time to the inept staff."
1,Small Ramen shop with a simple menu of a handful of ramens all for about $7 a bowl. The service was fast and the food was great. Good food at a great value just minutes away from the Vegas strip.
1,"I've followed Keli from her previous wax studio to her new location. She opened her own mini spa in Salon 3121. \n\nI live between Phoenix, San Francisco and  Los Angeles. It's always difficult to find a good service professional. I have found the previous professionals didn't match up to my LA and SF girls. I went through four different estheticians before luckily landing Keli. She's detailed, fast, clean and a total professional. She also uses hard wax is easier on the skin. Almost pain free. I wish I could move her to LA! \n\nSince she's her own boss, her prices are great too. I have finally found someone in Phoenix that I trust for my skin care."
1,"I've been going to Fashion Nails for almost 5 years and they treat me like a VIP when I walk in the door!  Tina and Tom both do an outstanding job on my pink/white, and I get so many compliments - even from complete strangers.  They do quality work on their pedicures and waxing as well.  I have never been disappointed by this place.  Of course they always try to upsell (especially on the pedi services), but what self respecting nail salon doesn't???  The salon is well maintained, clean, stylish and staffed with friendly, talented people."
1,This place has:\n\n- Pulled pork sandwiches.\n- Artisan Roast coffee.\n- Nick Cave playing in the background.\n\nNeed I say more?
0,"Husband and I ordered a late breakfast. He had belgian waffle breakfast, I has the corned beef hash. \nThe bad: Corned beef hash was nothing special, tasted like the stuff you get out out a can. My hash browns were blond, rather firm, and possibly starting to turn bad... They had that slightly-off taste. My husband's scrambled eggs were watery (not runny, but surrounded by liquid). The belgian waffle was also cold by the time it came out... It had obviously sat in the window for a while while my food was bring prepared. \nThe good: fresh, hot coffee (they left the thermos pot on the table, which was nice), sausage links were fine, waffle was fine, my food was piping hot when it came out. \nThe total came to $26, which is more than the meal was worth, considering the poor quality of the breakfast food."
1,"I came here for lunch and what a pleasant surprise.\n\n4 stars for atmosphere. This is an old house (hence the name) set amongst a garden right around the corner from the Farm and South Mountain. This reminds of a place in Napa that you'd stop in for. A nice, rural out of town feel not to far from central Phoenix.\n\nWhile there was nothing on the menu that immediately jumped out at me, I settle for a ham and cheese sandwich. It was DELICIOUS!!!!! And the sweet potato chips were a fantastic side considering that I HATE AND DESPISE sweet potatoes.\n\nThe salads and greens all look amazing. I will definitely be back."
0,"gour*met (grme, gr me) \n\nn.  1. a connoisseur of fine food and drink; epicure.\nadj. 2. of, characteristic of, or designed for gourmets.\n3. of or involving fancy or exotic foods.\n\nThey should remove the word \""gourmet\"" from the restaurant sign. \n\nThe chips were pretty good. The service was lacklustre and ambivalent (would it kill you to smile, mr waiter?). The lighting was too bright. The chile relleno was soggy and swimming in tomato saucey water (whuuuut?). The burrito was huge but also swimming next to the relleno and a bit soggy (I felt guilty for having had an animal live and die just to go into that). \n\nI don't know what the high reviewers see in this place...maybe other reviewers have assessed it rightly that they just don't know good quality food. Maybe the giant portion sizes impress them; for me, it's just more bad food. I actually prefer Taco Bell to this overpriced underwhelming \""gourmet\"" restaurant. I was craving Leticia's but they were closed. Next time I'll just wait. This place has Leticia's prices but not even fast food quality.  Disappointing."
0,Another one star for this place.  Who makes the customers in line wait 5+ minutes to put together an order for a pick up order?!  It would make more sense to cater to the customers in line waiting.
1,"My team had a great dinner here one night. The atmosphere and the service were both extremely pleasant. \n\nThe meatballs that we shared as an appetizer were enough for 3 people to get a good taste. My toasted ravioli (a heavy dish, to be sure) was very filling and satisfying."
0,"I should have know when I saw the sign that said \""NO REFUNDS\""\n\n I have been to many many foot massage places and this, by far, was the worst. I got a groupon for a 90 minute massage for $28.00 - Great deal, right? Well - 30 minutes of the massage was being hooked up to an ion machine, 60 minutes was a massage. We paid $10 additional dollars for a full body massage. The massage was very bad. I paid $28 for the Groupon + $10 for the whole body rub + $10 tip (why did I tip??). $58.00 for a 60 minutes massage that was subpar...."
1,"A nice place to take a breather from the fun and frivolity of Vegas.  I've been here twice --- once for an exhibit of impressionists when the place first opened, then again for an Andy Warhol showing.  It's a lovely little museum.  In fact, it was Julia Roberts' workplace in the movie, \""Ocean's 11.\""   The admission is reasonable.  The place has a gift shop offering a lot of cool ways to introduce your kids to fine art. Definitely worth a visit.\n\nFind out more at:\nhttp://www.bellagio.com/amenities/gallery-of-fine-art.aspx"
1,Great atmosphere. Bar staff was incredible. Food was amazing. Highly recommend this sushi spot. They have a little bit of everything on the menu as well. And the surrounding area was incredible. Food was affordable for sure and tasted great.
1,New to the area and have already been here a couple of times. The cilantro jalape\u00f1o hummus is amazing! Other than that I've only got the Philly chicken because it's just so yummy :) My boyfriend likes the gyros! If you do take out it has always came out super quick for me.
1,"As previous reviews have stated, the portions here are HUGE! I ordered a Deluxe Chicken Burrito and certainly was not disappointed. We started off with their chips, salsa, and table side guacamole. The chips are a bit thicker than I like, but tasty nonetheless. The salsa is quite thin and the guacamole isn't overwhelming with lime and salt like some other restaurants. \n\nThe staff hasn't been very warm and welcoming, but I wasn't expecting southern hospitality from a traditional Mexican joint. They are attentive and refill beverage/chips/salsa. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas and I'm a little jealous of the flavorful sauce in which they've marinated the meat. The \""fixings\"" they serve along the fajitas are just the same as what is served on top of my burrito; guacamole, lettuce, sour cream, tomato with rice and beans alongside. He was a little disappointed with that, but it worked perfectly with my meal. \n\nAll in all, Don Pedro is definitely a location I will try again to see if there are even better GIANTS meals to enjoy."
0,Very bad experience of dealing with this company. I ordered 14 pictures of my choice and paid for that. Now they are saying that I have to pick pictures from photographer selection. WTF? If I want anything which is not in this list I have to pay 10$ per photo.
1,"Love this yoga studio!!  You can tell the minute you meet the owner, Karin, that she is passionate about yoga and wants to share this experience with everyone!  She is great as an instructor - caring, and so encouraging!  Ursula is another instructor that I really like!  Her voice is so melodic, she is very encouraging and the fact that she and Karin come by and \""spritz\"" you with lemongrass water during the practice, is so refreshing.  It is a great way to have the maximum stretch and after blowing out both knees, I find I can keep in shape and the bonus is how many calories you burn in the hot room!"
0,"No. Just... No. \n\nYes, the free wifi rules (with a $20 resort fee per night) and yes the dueling pianos are awesome ($5 cover just to stand inside, $15 if you want to sit...) but the pool is minuscule & has NO SUN (!!) until noon, there's very little people cruising the strip on this side, the food is mediocre and their customer service sucks. Hard.\n\nAt 6:45am the morning after we checked in a strange man walked into our room, using a key & turned on the lights. We are two ladies passed out after a long day of getting to Vegas & had the hell scared out of us. Probably scared him, too. \n\nI call to front desk, obviously very upset & confused and she tries blaming it on me saying it either didn't happen or we must have left our door open & he randomly walked in!!! She checks the computer saying no other keys have been made for our room & insists it was our fault. Then she suddenly puts me on hold for 5 minutes because he came back down to the front desk saying exactly what I said. \n\nShe offers no apologies, no making it up to us, just says it rarely happens & we can get a new key programmed. Like that makes a difference. Wow. When I ask to speak to a manager, she says she is one. When we ask for a room she says we have to wait until 9am to see if there is anything available. I ask if she'll be on at that time and no... I get to explain this all to a new manager. \n\nVery very very unhappy with New York New York."
0,Food was ok but it took so long to get our food we canceled half of it & went some where else
0,Would not recommend this salon to minorities because of racist workers. I love the clients at the salon but behind the scenes its very unprofessional and unsanitary however I still wish Peter and Holy much success in all they do.
0,"The food was tasty & much fresher than I expected. I was also surprised to see that our party of 6 could be seated right away considering we were there on a holiday weekend during peak dinner hours.\n\nHowever, what really bothered me was how scatter brained the wait staff was. The table next to us was waiting most of their meal for their order of fried rice to come out. So much so that when we got our order, they thought that it was their order (so did we...and even the waiter wasn't sure so he had to go back and check). We also asked for our sweet & sour soup to come out first (as it should) and yet it came out 2nd and only after we asked our waitress where it was. \n\nThis just seemed to be the place's MO. On several occasions we saw servers come up to our & others' tables with food in their hand not sure if they were to put them down or bring them to a different table. \n\nIf the are able to straighten this out, this restaurant would be a great place to check out while at the Rio. However, until then, if I want some good Chinese food, I'll just drive down the street a bit & visit Vegas' Chinatown."
0,"The carpet is completely unsanitary and a breeding ground for MRSA. The instructor only verbally ran the class, never demonstrated one pose OR even made rounds to correct those doing them wrong. Lots of people that hadn't done yoga before because of the groupon and it's unfortunate they have been thought incorrectly. This instruction method is going to cause people injuries. FYI never do a jerking twisting motion with your upper body to try and square your hips!!! The instructor even told me and another girl NOT to drink water at the moment we did! So not OK, always listen to your bodies needs."
1,"I could pretty much copy and paste my review for their previous location as Frostbites Shavery - but I'll just say the bottom line:\n\nThis is the best shaved snow/ice/stuff in town. They're open good hours, and everything is made fresh. The guys who own it run the front lines as well. They love to hear what you have to say and take pride in their product.\n\nBlack sesame is easily my favorite but that isn't to say the other flavors aren't delicious. The chocolate and fresh cantaloupe are also fantastic. Taro and egg pudding are often our go-to toppings. We're hoping and praying rice balls end up in the mix someday!"
1,"Normally, I would never go to a dealership for anything, but I needed a duplicate key for my Honda as it has a chip in it and required special programming. While there, I noticed that they do auto detailing. I had just bought a used Honda from a private sale, and it was filthy. I'm talking tan interior that was stained gray from years of smoking, sticky residues in all the compartments, stale smell from years of smoking weed in the car (there were weed bits all through the carpet). The engine bay had so much dirt on it that the car smelled like it was burning after even short drive. The car had not been loved. I felt like I needed biohazard wear just to sit in the seat.\n\nFor 125 bucks Honda West did a complete interior, exterior and engine bay cleaning. It came back sparkling, and smelled good without a residual chemical smell.  It looked like a whole new car. They even managed to get out some of the exterior scratches.  Definitely the best 125 bucks I've spent in awhile. My only complaint is that it was still soaking when I picked it up and I ended up with a wet bum on the drive home."
1,"We came here friday morning for crepes to celebrate my daughters birthday. We got the nutella/strawberry crepe, and the ricotta/citrus/berry jam crepe, they were delicious, large and had plenty of filling. My daughter wanted a caramel macchiato, and the lovely young woman who took our order suggested the caramel latte, since their macchiato was different than what starbucks has, so we ordered both. The latte was good and the macchiato looked good, in a tiny espresso cup, yet I didnt like its flavor so woulnt order again. Since it was her birthday, my daughters drink was free, and she loved the writing on the cup, which was just the drinks name, but very artistic.Great way to start her birthday! (they also had some delicious looking pastries!)"
0,"I hate having to do this, but:\n\nOne entree.\nThree completely different hairs.\nGag.\n\nMy husband stopped in and ordered to-go on Saturday night at 10:00.  Came home.  We were missing egg drop soup.  The cream cheese won-tons (crab rangoon) were good.\n\nI opened the lid on my lemon chicken and noticed a thick dark hair.  It ended up being very long and had been cooked in the batter that was on the chicken. \n\nI was very hungry and picked out the affected chicken and proceeded to eat some of the meal.  After munching on the broccoli that was under the chicken, I picked up a piece and discovered a curly white hair on it--it might have been a clothing fiber or a pet hair, not really sure, but I was SO DONE at this point.\n\nThen I glanced over at the cup of lemon sauce stuff I had been given and noticed an eyebrow hair stuck to the inside of the cup halfway down where it wasn't noticeable until some of the sauce had been used.\n\nMy husband had orange chicken and said that it was really tough and didn't taste good.\n\nHe ate one more cream cheese won-ton after they had cooled and said it didn't taste so good anymore and just tasted full of grease.  \n\nWe're both just sort of grossed out by this whole meal.  :("
1,"Not too long ago, I worked in Green Tree (no this isnt deja-vu of another review, I've literally worked everywhere!)  \n\nAs much as I disliked that call center job and the traffic on the way home, I always made sure to appreciate 'the light at the end of the tunnel' - or in this case the view at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIt's so amazing and something I always look forward too. We are so lucky to have that unexpected, breathtaking view of our city! \""The city with an entrance!\"""
1,"Mom, Dad, and I ventured out for a nice meal at the new Benihana at the Chandler Fashion Center, and it was a very good choice.\n\nHaving your food cooked right in front you along with a little chef artistry entertainment, makes this meal a little more special.  The meal is hand-crafted and fresh, adding a nice touch.\n\nI had Scallops, Calamari, and Shrimp.  Dad did as well.  We enjoyed it.  Mom went with the Filet Mignon and I was allowed a bite and mmm, mmm - delicious and tender, melted in my mouth.\n\nI now want to go to the one in San Francisco, as every time I try to go to it there, it is always busy.\n\nGreat Service\nNice Staff\nGood Food\nNice Ambiance\n\nYour own food, cooked right there where you see it being crafted, then dished out to your bowl was superb."
0,"Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.  \nWe get there and the hostess simply said \""follow me\"" she did not make eye contact or even ask \""how's your evening?\"" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nNext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\nOverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nFOOD:\nMy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\nI ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nWe also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nWe had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only \""new Orleans\"" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nFor the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nWe will surely never return."
0,I was very disappointed! It's not reasonable in price for what they give you. The portions are small and I couldn't even see the meat in my taquitos. I think business would be much better if they went down on their prices and gave you more. For what I spent there I could of spent less somewhere else and got way more food for my money.
0,"Worst meal I have had to date.  Orange Beef, hot n sour soup, brown rice all terrible.  How do you mess up rice?  The rice has some smokey coal bad water flavor going on....yuck...good bye 30 dollars."
0,"My parents used Sparklett's for years, so I went with Sparklett's when I moved out on my own.  I've had it for years and never really had any major problems, until now.  I've lived at the same address for 10 years with the same service and all of a sudden, I can't get my water delivered according to their schedule.  I've called several times and even put in for an extra delivery, but they won't drop off any water.  I'm on autopay and have a zero balance, so that isn't the issue.  I looked online and my delivery history has a note from a new delivery man stating that I either moved or died.  No such luck, Mr. Delivery Man. More phone calls to their 800 number and still no water."
1,"It was love at first bite. I was in the neighborhood and finally got the chance to check Suzuya out. The place was pretty busy, but luckily that gave me ample time to peruse the display case and figure out what I wanted to order. I couldn't resist the strawberry crepe cake and a red bean cream puff for my fella. \n\nThe ordering and payment process is very convenient and I was out the door in minimal time with my adorable little box of desserts. I made it as far as my car before I was compelled to take a bite of the crepe cake. Holy cow! It was absolutely amazing. The flavors were so subtle and yet explosive. The flavors were right on and I can't believe it took me as long as it did to give them a try. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but this place truly blew my mind. Not overly sweet and the all-natural flavors really shown. \n\nI heard after the fact that the crepe cake is hard to come by, only making me wish I had bought more than one when I had the chance. Have no fear, I will be back... and soon."
1,"I am new to Fountain Hills AZ and needed the windows on our home cleaned.  I called AJ at Steak Patrol because the Yelp reviews were so high.  He was not only an awesome person to work with but did an amazing job.  He not only cleaned windows, tracks and screens but tightened my sticky screen doors so they slid perfectly without me asking.  He worked hard, did a great job, and worked quickly. His prices are very good and the quality of work is excellent.  I highly recommend Streak Patrol!"
0,If ZERO stars were possible this gym would be getting that from me. My husband went to this gym today with the 14 pass and at the end of his workout inquired about membership. The lady he spoke to was extremely rude. She told him that he should not have come in without checking with someone first ( mind you that the staff does not show up till 9am and he began his workout at 7am). After scolding him for being at the gym she asked him to leave and said that they were very selective in the people whom the allowed to join their gym. I'm not the type to write reviews but obvious racism is a very good reason for me to break a habit. The lady was very condescending. She is Caucasian and my husband is Latino.
0,"I have eaten here three times in the last 3 years and each time swear it will be my last. As a Caesars 7* player we are supposed to get seated immediately, but Centrals hostesses don't allow this, and aren't nice about it. \nWe ate here on this trip because Caesars terrific food court is being remodeled and there was no place else to eat a late breakfast. Unlike when they first opened, the place never seems to even be half full anymore. \nThere were 3 hostesses on duty with little to do but talk to each other. Our waiter was matter of fact, not very friendly, and could never find him when we needed a drink refill or anything else. \nI ordered the chopped salad. Very small portion, yet very expensive. Bland and tasteless. Disappointing. They also don't serve any bread with salad or any other entree I saw. I had French fries, which were good but not worth $12. They give you a little container of ketchup and good luck getting more. You'd think for that price they'd have some different sauces for the fries. \nMy husband also said his food was almost tasteless, and he felt the variety of choices was very limited for 1:00 in the afternoon.\n$60 for a $25 meal which was missing flavor and missing good service and very uncomfortable seating. It is also loud in there since it's completely open and you're right off the lobby."
1,"love this place so much!!! the owner is so kind and all the workers make the best pizza i've ever had. hope this place goes big because the idea is great and their product is delicious!!! 7.75 for an 11\"" pizza is a steal! def recommend for pizza lovers and all you hungry peeps :)"
0,I bought a Livingsocial deal for Thai Orchid. It was a disappointment going to Thai Orchid. It was toally different than what I expected it would be.  This place have the pan fried noodle and it is very rare for restaurants to make the pan fried noodle right. The pan friend noodle was plain taste and nothing special. The noodle soup was bland taste. The vegetable they used in the noodles were cheap. Bunch of cheap onions and baby corn. There were big slice onions not thin onions.The wait staff was nice but honestly the food wasn't good.
1,"It was 1am on Monday morning.  We all had early flights to catch, and we just wanted something cheap and delicious to end another fun trip to Vegas.  Somehow we found ourselves in Bill's Gamblin' Hall because one of our friends could swear they had steak and eggs.  Luckily, they did AND it was only $6.99.  It came with eggs, hash brown, toast, and steak.  Our server (Ervin) was super nice.  Our orders came out just as we wanted them (and we all asked for different ways to cook the eggs and steak).  All-in-all, we left as very happy and full customers!"

0,"We had the Queso Fundido with Taquitos for an appetizer. The dip was great and the chips were great, but the taquitos were dry and boring. For entrees, we had the mole, which was good, but not great. We also had the mango, chipotle chicken and the sauce was great, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the flavor was soaked into the chicken, so it tasted bland.\n\nAs others have said, the entrees are very large, so that is a plus.\n\nWe would like to come back and try happy hour and some \""safer\"" entrees such as the chimichanga and hopefully they will be better executed."
0,"I hate Best Buy. How dare you even call yourself \""Best Buy\"" when you are nowhere near the \""best buy\"" on anything? Your prices are inflated to a point that I find offensive and your staff has to be some of the rudest, most entitled (to what, I cannot tell you) group of individuals I've ever met. \n\nWas there a couple years back with Collin S. to easily get the worst customer service I've ever received while trying to buy a giant HDTV. The main TV salesman straight up refused to help me. I asked for his assistance several times, he ignored me and was just a cocky son of a bitch like helping me was somehow beneath him. It took everything out of me not to unleash a YOU WORK FOR ME ASSHAT on him, but somehow I refrained, probably because I am a lady : )\n\nI ended up having to seek a manager who must've slapped his employee upside the head as all of a sudden he stopped being an asshole and was willing to help me. Thoughtful of them, don't you think? Willing to help me spend $1,000 at their store? That is really just soooo generous of them.\n\nAnyways, I do not like Best Buy. The only Best Buy I like is in a tiny little town called Anderson, South Carolina because everyone who works there is polite and I only go there once a year over Thanksgiving when I'm in town visiting my grandfather. It's in the middle of nowhere so it is the calmest Black Friday Best Buy in the world, I am convinced.\n\nTo make a long story short, if you must go to Best Buy, avoid the one on 20th St & Camelback like the plague, and hop on a plane to Greenville, South Carolina, you'll thank me, I'm certain of it."
0,i have no idea why this place has good reviews!  my salad was ok but the dressing was pure oil!!  the gyro meat was dry and had little flavor!  try yassous greek grill on buffalo and charleston or sultans grill on village center off town center and summerlin pky!
0,"Fellow Las Vegans if you EVER need service on your auto please do yourself a HUGE favor and DO NOT TAKE your car to Ted Wiens Tire & Auto on Warm Springs and Eastern. We took our car there .. it was supposed to take them 3hrs to repair. We now its 24 hrs plus into a 3 hrs repair . Because they broken a critical part putting it back together and had to ship it overnight to fix, then has stalled at repairing it was supposed to be complete at 10am and its 1pm now. So do yourself  favor AVOID like the Plague Ted Wiens Tire & Auto on Warm Springs and Eastern."
0,"August Henry's has a lot of potential - the location could be a prime spot for pre-theater diners, for post-theater drinks, for weekend lunch while out and about downtown.  But the service makes it pretty awful.\n\nI was staying at the Courtyard across the street on a recent visit to Pittsburgh and my brother and I ventured over to August Henry's to grab a drink and a snack as we prepared to do some bar/happy hour hopping.  It was about 3 pm on a Saturday.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  There were 2 other people at the bar, both drinking beers.  After we sat down, someone, who I assumed was the bartender came over and asked if we wanted some waters while we waited.  Um, sure?  I was a little confused as I was unsure exactly what I was waiting for.  I assumed a menu.  After about 15 minutes of not another single person even looking in our direction or speaking a word to us, we left.  I'm still not entirely sure what I was supposed to be waiting for.  Some communication would have helped.  I would have considered giving it another try on Sunday during the football game, but they weren't open.  \n\nI would possibly give it another try next time I'm back in town - but only if I can't find a better option.  Sorry August Henry's - I'm still wondering what we were waiting for."
1,CIIIIIBBBOOOOOOOOOOO I LOOOOVE YOU! I came here for the very first time this past Sat night with an out of town friend and my hubs!! and it was AMMMAZING! we arrived at around 7:30 and it was PACKED we would have had an 1.5 hour wait for a table!!! luckily though there were exactly three seats next to each other at the bar - which is also full service - meant to be!\n\nMATT MATT MAAAATTTTT - was our AWESOME waiter  - he was at the bar all night totally hanging out with us and tawking!!! it was just so fun!!! I had the roasted veggie app plate and it was packed with flavor and absolutely scrumptious (the carrots!!!) and then moved on to the veggie pizza - delicious!!! and ended up with the the nutella crepe!! (Um yeah I splurged... Karve anyone??)\n\nbut the best BEST BEEEEST part of all was the (accidental) entertainment... the nervous cougar who checked out my bff ALL night long and even followed him to the bathroom..finally she built up the courage to come over and talk to him (this is after asking our waiter Matt if I was his girlfriend to make sure the coast was clear)\n\n anyway she was chatting him up all night completely oblivious to the fact that her targeted cub has errr... hot pink fur..... what a grrreeeeat night!!!!

1,Love coming to Target. It's crazy busy here right now. I wish they had more lanes open.
1,I really don't know what this people are talking about.\nI have been her costumer more than 3 years now and never had any problems.
0,"I own multiple rental houses and I've been searching for a good plumber I can trust.  I decided to give Number One a shot when one house got a small shower leak.  For the 15 minute job installing an inexpensive part, they charged $225.\n\nI heard from the tenant that the plumber that showed up was very polite and efficient, but that isn't worth $800 / hr.  Number One foolishly priced themselves out of lots of future business with me and my family."
0,"After three and a half years working with business owners, planning events, trying to connect people to places worth praising, I've learned a lot. Now this is not to say I know everything there is to know about running a small business, I'd be running one if I did. But I do know a couple of things, and I'm about to reveal a million dollar secret that will take any business from bummer to bustling: \n\nPEOPLE FIRST\n\nHuge, right? \n\nNow what do I mean by this? \n\nIf you own a small business, you probably do so for several reasons... but your first should be people. You should want to turn on the lights, unlock the doors, welcome members of the community into your space and exchange something for the money patrons are spending at your establishment. People are your business. It might not be the only reason, but it's why you exist.\n\nI've been to The Library a few times now and each time I'm there I don't feel like I'm welcome. I understand the place is tiny, it's typically packed with drunk coeds, it's loud, there's little room to maneuver, all of this I understand. But I also understand that it doesn't take much to make people feel like you value their business and you enjoy them experiencing the things that make you so stellar in a hospitable way. The staff that I've encountered is anything but hospitable. \n\nI tell business owners, strive for 5, in other words control everything you can control and work to give people five-star experiences. You can't be 100%, 100% of the time, but a smile goes a long way. A thanks for stopping in, come back and see us again goes even farther. I'm not certain what they're striving for at The Library other than closing time, when they can turn the lights off, lock the doors and not have to deal with people until tomorrow."
0,"Funny thing, if you notice Janelle G.'s review, she mentions she was staying at a hotel room, and a variety of her reviews are from Southern California.  As a Las Vegas resident, I have to wonder just how bad the Wal-Marts in Southern California are, really, for Janelle to have had such a wonderful experience at the Wal-Mart here in Las Vegas, verily the same Wal-Mart that is most convenient to my current place of residence. I try not to encourage regionalism, but that really does say something very telling to me.\n\nI hate this particular Wal-Mart, plain and simple.  The only reason why I rate this store as high as 2 stars is because the people that I have come into contact with working at this Wal-Mart are pretty efficient, caring people doing a thankless, faceless job.\n\nThis Wal-Mart's prices are not competitive. The prices at this store are pathetic in comparison with what I expect out of Wal-Mart, regardless of their marketing. I imagine it is because of the large amount of tourist traffic. If you live in Las Vegas, like Rufus and Scott and I and others, shopping somewhere else is probably to our advantage.\n\nAt this store, I can almost never find pants that fit me, and I wear a pretty common size. I can barely find sweatpants in my size! \n\nCome the first of the month, don't even THINK of going during the day time. Illegal Immigrant City! There are at least 36 checkout registers, only 12 of which are open."
0,"Very loud clubs all around it.  If you are going to be downtown clubbing all night than this hotel would be great, but if you want to sleep at night don't come here.  The clubs are really loud, especially between midnight and 3am.  The AC is so loud you can't hear yourself think, although it does cover over the loud clubs.  The facilities are fine though they are kind of back in an alley and not as new and nice as advertised."
0,"I have seen a few Cirque shows and i was not really all that impressed with this particular show. Tired old sexual jokes and gags. I have seen and heard all this stuff many times many places before. I really did not like the skit about the Instant implants made with whiskey. Really dumb. Yawn. Not hot! . Not much of anything. The entire show was sort of flat.(in more ways than one)  I did like the water ballet in the huge glass at the beginning of the show, but it was downhill from there. This show has lots of talent and potential, but it is wasted by lack of creativity. It seems like they did a Slam Bam, lets put a show together quickly.much better Cirque shows in Vegas than this one....would not repeat , zzzzzz, caught myself  fake laughing and then yawning. good thing they did not get me up on stage for anything or i would have used the time to fall asleep. After seeing Bon Jovi concert the night before this was a bore."
0,"The best thing about going to the Peppermill was that I could cross it off my \""To Try\"" list.  Maybe we caught it on an off night?  We went at dinner time and the place was full.  I had breakfast as that was recommended to me by friends.  Pancakes were horrible.  Dry, crumbly and unsaveable even with a dousing of syrup.  Two cute little pieces of bacon cowering in a corner of the huge plate.  The friend across from me had the chicken fettuccine alfredo.  Two dry, overcooked pieces of chicken sitting on a pile of pasta and sauce that was at the point where you could stand a fork in it.  With proper fork placement you could have lifted at least half if not the whole serving of pasta at one time.  Had to go back to the Cal and have Chili rice.\nWell, lesson learned.  Peppermill, Check!"
1,"Brazilian BBQ is not a place you eat,  Its a place you go to test your  manhood.  The salad bar is perfectly serviceable with a variety of different seafoods and small fixings but only serves as a way to line your stomach for the real meal.  Once the peg is flipped to green your endurance challenge begins.\n\nThe meat is delivered in no discernible order other than whats hot out of the kitchen,  You're free to turn away anything you don't want (ham) to focus on your favorite cuts, but like I said, This is an endurance test and turning away food is a sign of weakness.  It's not cheap so earn your meal by cramming as much delicious prime rib down your gullet as possible.  Carve off chunks of sirloin, lamb and sausage until you start sweating and then slam down your drink and demand more,  Punish your heart for allowing you to live as long and healthily as it has for so many years.  These animals have given their life for you, make it a sacrifice worthy of the gods themselves.\n\nBut please,  save room for the chocolate mousse cake."
0,"Worse service ever. We were the only customers seated in the back area since we were 5 in the group. The waiters and waitresses never check on us if we needed something and every time we needed more bread or water we had to call one of them.  When we were done eating, nobody check on us if we needed dessert or more food. The service was so bad that we had to ask a waitress where to get our bill to pay for our food.  We should not have given them any tip but still gave them 10% in gratuities just for the food.  Food was okay except for the poor customer service."
1,"this place is dangerous!  not somewhere you can go for 'just a drink'.  for one, they give you the extra shaker with your martini, so it's really like getting two drinks at the same time.  combine that with happy hour prices, and the drinks come too easily!  if you like a fruity drink, try the mango madness - i rarely order anything else!\n\nas for food - the appetizers are always a big hit.  the cheese/fruit plate, the bbq pizza, and the chicken skewers are popular!"
1,"Great alternative to the traditional burger joint. I've been a Chef in the valley for a long time, and this place is one of my favorites. Great dinning experience, lots of nice menu items you wont find anywhere else. I suggest trying the bison sliders. Or if your adventurous the ostrich."
0,Poor service is the status quo at this place.  I came in and sat myself after standing in the door way for a couple of minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to seat myself because no one was their nor was their any signage  to direct people.\n\nI sat at the table and waited for 10 mins and one had even said hello or made any eye contact.  There was a person at the table next to me that was having the same issue.
0,"This eatery opened July 21st. This is the first visit my partner and I  had at this restaurant. I ordered the shrimp burger and he ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, with one order of large fries. We were expecting a great experience, based on the reviews that are here on Yelp, what we got was a mediocre experience at best. The Shrimp burger was great...great taste, excellent consistency, a very good choice, the bacon cheeseburger was dry. The order of fries in our opinion did not represent the large order that we had expected, and to make things worse, they were practically cold. We did speak with a \""mover\"" (Burger 21 speak) and although he  was not apologetic, we did receive another order of fries shortly thereafter. The fries, unlike some reviews on here are nothing to write home about. When the dining experience was over, we did have 2 staff members come up to us, and ask us how we liked it. I gave them honest reviews, telling them that given the overall experience, it is nothing more than an upscale McDonalds. I think that they are focusing on  the many sauces they offer, some of which are downright weird, and the many shakes they have, not focusing on the main product. Even the napkins they give out are very chintzy. One staff member was open to the feedback, offering us free dessert, while the other member, a member of management openly disagreed with my comments, and even stated that the chef would not like to hear what we had to say. Overall, we decided that it was not horrible, but yet, we would not recommend this restaurant, and would not go out of our way to return."
1,"First time here and I can't believe I'm saying this... but I love this more than Panera Bread (and I'm a big fan)! the layout is so simple. First, you enter the line and you order sandwiches, paninis or a salad with the first person, you roll over to the next and you order your soups. They have an amazing array of soups & it was delicious! Then, there's the desserts last and then the cashier. The food is so simple and so quick. It comes out right away! I ordered a half (a panini and soup) and it was less than $10! At the end, they give you a chocolate covered strawberry and bread. Knowing me... I'm a sucker for chocolate covered anything and that just put the cherry to my sundae! I'm definitely coming back and trying their salad next time.\n\nMy order:\nTurkey Spinach Artichoke panini- I love how quick it was made since I was rushing but I wish there was a little bit more artichoke!\nRate: 4/5\n\nLobster Bisque- mmm so creamy!!\nRate: 5/5\n\nChocolate covered strawberry & bread: complimentary with the meal!\nRate: 5/5\n\nI can't wait to eat here again!"
0,"This company has terrible customer service.  I contacted them about a repair that they had a warranty on.  The warranty was for 1 year.  The part broke after 8.5 months and they refuse to even discuss it with me.  The woman on the phone yelled at me like I was an idiot and said that since I called another repair company to fix it, they wouldn't warranty their work.  At the time my ceiling had water pouring down so I needed to get it fixed ASAP.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
0,"This Target has Phycho employees! I went into the fitting room area with my daughter, 13 and the employee, DESI was EXTREMELY rude to us from the start. She treated us like criminals as she grabbed the clothes out of our hands with force to count them. Apparently I do not know how to count to 6 in front of her. My daughter was trying on a couple of bikinis and was going to need help as well as was going to need my approval. Desi said it was Target corporate policy that we could not be in the same room. LIE NUMBER ONE! Believe me, I called. We went into separate rooms like she ordered. Each time my daughter came out to show me something, DESI stepped into the hall to watch us to make sure we were not in the same room. At one point my daughter was having trouble getting the latch hooked in the back of her top. I went into her room to help her connect it, and within 3 seconds DESI was there banging on our door violently demanding that I get out of her fitting room. It frightened my daughter so much she began to cry. I lost it. We got a manager involved in the situation and as I was telling the manager what happened, DESI was in the back ground laughing and rolling her eyes. My husband caught her twice and brought it to the attention of the manager. As we were talking to the manager, another customer came out and complained about the way DESI was treating her as well. \n\nAbsolutely nothing was done. I am so disappointed in Target as a whole. The manager has not called me back, and corporate was a joke. Now my daughter is fearful of that Target and hesitant to go into a fitting room. Thanks Target"
0,"I went here for a motorcycle battery and the guy at the counter was absolutely relentless in attempting to sell me a much more expensive one. At first I explained that I really only needed a cheap one and thanked him for his advice. He responded with \""I never give advice, I just provide information!\"". Then he became extremely testy and said that he just couldn't believe that I would decide on the lessor battery. Frankly, I simply wanted procure an inexpensive battery not a ration of this knuckleheads' hostile attitude.In all fairness the lessor battery does work fine, However, next time I'll buy my batteries elsewhere."
1,Why was my first time at the old town Tavern it was on Easter Sunday the place was packed but this girl Barb kicked ass and did a great job I would highly recommend this place
0,"I am writing this as my last will and testament as I am pretty sure I just drank poison. Upon the first sip of my non-fat Vanilla Latte, I thought something was off - way off. A subtle hint of coffee was present but something else was lurking as well. Feeling brave, I took another sip. Nope. Definitely poison. (Well, it tasted like hairspray which I'm pretty sure is poison if ingested.)  Too bad I was already back at work and no way was I driving back to DD. (What if I died while on the road?) Instead I dumped the whole thing down the drain. I then informed my co-worker that if I died to take the receipt from my purse and demand a refund to help pay for the funeral. He did not find this funny. \n\nI am giving this DD only one star as I did not actually die and the breakfast sandwich I purchased was just \""okay\"". I guess there is a reason why Donuts is in their name - it's the only thing they really do well. I definitely will not be back."

0,Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
1,"Took my nieces and nephew ages 2-13 for an open bounce session.  Two hours for $7 per bouncer regardless of age.  They all had a great time.\n\nIt is pretty much two big rooms containing eight different bouncers, some familiar, some not.  A few types of obstacle courses, the big slide, a boxing ring, basketball court, a tower, etc.  There was air hockey and some video games too.\n\nI was most impressed by the ability to have kids of all ages together in one room while most of the parents sat on the side reading or talking to each other.  It is like a big playground where kids can climb and do crazy things without any worry of injury.  My nephew has a knack for falling, he had a blast bouncing right up afterwards."
1,"My favorite Las Vegas Hotel. I've stayed pretty much everywhere and this is my favorite. (MGM, Mandalay, Wynn, Venitian, Palazzo, Bellagio, Encore...) THis is just a little bit more modern and the lines here aren't crazy. Every room is a sweet with some sort of living room and the bathrooms are all large. I believe this was orginally supposed to be condos so the rooms are bigger than most. Can't go wrong staying here!"
1,She's the best!!
0,"We checked this place out because we were really hungry and had to go to Greenland... And ugh no bueno... It was pretty empty inside and yet it still took 5 minutes to get waters and another 5 minutes to take our orders... \nWe got springrolls, chicken pho & oxtail pho.. \nThe springrolls were ok.. I thought it was so weird that they had shredded lettuce inside of them (see pic).. I've never had one like that it made them look cheap & weird.. The peanut sauce was pretty good though... \nThen it took another 10 minutes for the pho to come out.. Which is pretty long for pho\nThe chicken pho is not shredded chicken like how we like but weird tasting & fake looking chicken..\nThe oxtail was kind of dry & tasted old.. And the noodles were so over cooked that they kept breaking before I could get them into my mouth ... Lol \nAlso their little veggie plate that they give to accompany the pho ... Is so so sad looking.. It's like half the size of what other restaurants give. \n\nWith so many other options for pho in this city.. I probably won't be coming back here."
0,"SERVICE\nStumbled upon this place while shopping in Tempe Marketplace.  We went to dinner around 5 on a Saturday so it was not crowded at all.  That being said, to echo others, the service was pretty bad when there was really no reason for it to be so.  Ordered a salad and was not asked what dressing I wanted so I assumed it was already dressed.  Salad was served with no dressing and could not flag down a server to get dressing for about 10 minutes.  I sat there and made my companions all feel to awkward to eat because I couldn't eat the salad without dressing (literally, dry as a bone).   It was generally hard to get our server to our table and when we managed, he seemed irritated.  \n\nMENU\nLargely overpriced.  It's bar food with a little extra but at dinner prices.  My companion had the Sliders which were unremarkable but the beef was of relatively good quality.  \nI ordered the Chop Shop cobb which was again, overpriced (aprox $12 for something a bit larger than a dinner salad) which was fresh and had some good produce (although my avocado was not ripe) but again, not dressed and sort of boring in the end.  \nDiversity was lacking- a small selection of pretty generic offerings.  \n\nCLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY\nThis is going to gross some people out but I was given a straw without a wrapper on it and when I put it in my mouth, it was salty... as though someone had stuck a sweaty/dirty hand into a bin of straws.  My dinner companion had the exact same experience.  We were both really unnerved and grossed out.  \n\nATMOSPHERE\nIt's brand new so the facilities are generally clean and well kept but the atmosphere is ridiculous.  It's sort of Texas Roadhouse meets Coyote Ugly and neither work very well.  There's just something awkward about trying to eat dinner with a mechanical bull beside you."
0,Let me start of by saying that yogis grill got me to like sushi but this was at their chandler location. I recently moved so I saw that I had a yogis grill close by so my girlfriend and I went tonight and was so disappointed.\n\nCustomer service is everything and the girls working the register did not know how to treat a customer if it hit them in the face. One of them was so rude that she even did an eye roll to my girl. \n\nWe got 2 rolls. 1 Vegas roll and 1 crunch roll. The Vegas roll was okay but it was burnt and it only had 6 pieces instead of 8 like the chandler location. The crunch roll was also okay but nothing special. For the prices I'm paying at this location I would expect they would know how to make a damn roll right but I guess not.\n\nNever will come back here again and I'm currently looking for another place near by that will give me a quality roll like yogis grill once did.\n\nDon't make the same mistake I did.
1,"Eating here was such a unique experience. Since I'm a huge fan of Raku, the dessert next door was a place I had to check out. I went here not expecting anything much, except to be at a typical dessert cafe. Boy, was I wrong. \n\nThe decor is modern and hip, with a glass wall of bottles along the entry way. Everything's in white and the open kitchen that's set up with the best tools from All-Clad and the cutest utensils resembles my dream kitchen. \n\nI got the pre fixe menu ($19). If you share this pre-fixe menu, they bump up the price. So for whatever, reason the calculations added up so that it was best for my bf and I to get one pre fixe menu plus 1 a la carte item. \n\nFirst, the menu was edible. Without having read the reviews, my instincts kicked in, and I asked the waitress if the menu was edible to which she responded, \""try it.\"" I smelled it and licked it and then thought they were playing some practical joke on me so I stopped, feeling really embarrassed. I'm glad I was wrong. \n\nI ordered the Red Rock. I for some reason expected a chocolate flavor but it was something else. The cream puff was just an OK for me. \n\nThe other additional a la carte was the Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake) which is one of the most popular cakes in Japan. Since I've grown up all my life eating this cake, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. Normally the chestnut cream is yellowish as it's more condensed. Here, I think they use less and I couldn't taste the chestnut as much.  \n\ni think the best part of my dessert dish was the yuzu marshmallows. I was so amazed by the taste as well as texture. \n\nThe tea was awesome. Can't remember which one I had, but I don't think you can go wrong. I'm still curious about going back to try the other chocolate tower cake as well as the water that's imported from Japan. \n\nIn terms of creativity this place is a solid 5 star. I knocked one star off just because the taste wasn't up to par as the appearance/presentation of the desserts. (I hear the booing. Forgive me, but I'm keeping it real)"
0,"God help you when there's a wrestling tournament in town and you're checking out a grad program in CU.  No Union, no historic Lincoln....yes Super 8.\n\nNow, Super 8 is...a Super 8.  You are not expecting a bevy of Milanese opera singers, clad in diaphanous shawls and wet with the last cloying droplets of the spring rain, to entertain you with their siren songs in front of the tiny fireplace in the antiseptic lobby.\n\nBut, you aren't expecting to see smoking/non-smoking rooms (least if you're from California, a land where tobacco smoking results in summary execution by armed guards)--and being put up in a smoking room is not much of a boon, especially when it smells as if the entire room is an ashtray.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to the disinterested yet vaguely friendly guy at the front lobby, he pulled his head back from teh phone where he was chattin' with his ladyfriend just long enough to query, \""Hey, you want Pops to go up and Febreeze that for ya?\""\n\nHe then gestured in the general direction of a stooped, wizened gentleman, wrinkled and neat, who looked exhausted.  I gulped back shame as I reached for the doorknob to leave.  \""Um, yeah, can you Febreeze it?\""  \n\nThat night it smelled like someone had been smoking in a flowery meadow.  \n\nThe one additional star is for the free wireless in the room.  But I felt I had to taste the air, so I don't know if it really should get that extra estrella.\n\nI'm so sorry, Pops.  But thanks for the Febreezin' anyway."
0,"Awful branch. The employees are awful and deceiving, and Nicholas yelled when I asked him why someone was going in front of us in line when he mentioned we were first in line. \n\nLast time I was here, service took forever, and no one was the least bit pleasant. I thought that was just an off day, but apparently it's like that quite often."
1,"Well deserving of 4 stars--it would need a bit more creativity with appetizers and sides etc. to get another star from me.\n\nHostesses and wait staff were all personable and professional.  We were met, greeted and escorted to our table promptly.  Friendly but not overly so.  Efforts are made to employ good looking people and the female staff should please the lads and dads.  Service was polished and prompt.\n\nWe both enjoyed the steak very much--\""himself\"" got the filet mignon and I tried the Flank (or whatever it is called that is flatish).  His was so tender you could eat with a fork--mine which is a more robust/flavorful cut arrived sliced, and was very good,too.  They came with 2 sauces --worchestershire and black peppercorn--served on the side.  Neither cut of meat really needed any enhancement.  We both ate every bit.\n\nWe tried scalloped potatoes and asparagus.  Note:  sides are not huge as in some steak houses--if you are a hearty eater you may need 2 all for yourself!  Dessert was the bananas foster bread pudding with ice cream which was \""deconstructed\""  (i.e. do-it-yourself with brioche type bread pudding accompanied by sliced bananas and syrup),  and it was just to die for.  Big portion which --in all honesty--was so good I would eat the entire thing myself next time -calories be damned.\n\nThe room is dark wood, modern with emphasis and mood created by light and dramatic (spare) asian-style floral arrangments.   Good for a business party or for a date.  The room is open to the casino.  We sat further into the room--which would be my choice in the future,too--bit more private and intimate, and far from the noise of the casino.\n\nDiners were a diverse group.  This was Memorial Weekend Monday. Moms and Dads from mid-America, newly-weds and younger hip people.  It was not terribly busy.\n\nWe didn't spend time in the bar--it looked inviting.\n\nI would eat there again.  Note: the day after we had dinner--I saw special deals for dinner for 2--which would have represented quite a bargain--makes me wonder if the place is still trying to establish itself--hope it does."
0,"I come here because I'm a fan of this chain and because it's the nearest Church's near my house.  The place is fairly clean as it's fairly new.\n   Last time I came though they were advertising a family meal with 2 large sides for $10.99 right upfront streetside of the establishment and unbeknownst to me charged my card $11.99 a day before they changed the price the following day.  Strike one.  Then I go to order and tell the guy I want all spicy, he tells me he only has half my order for the spicy I was like don't worry I'll wait, I want all spicy.  Waited a good 8-10 minutes he tells me okay you're good to go.  Surprise I get home and half is regular.  Like W-T-F you make me wait and still give me what you wanted.  Strike two.  I'll update qt a later day in cqse I go back, their sweet tea tends to draw me in.  Hope I'm not in for strike three."
1,"This place was delightful! We went here for a late lunch and wanted to eat outside, and we barely had a 10minute wait. We ordered the baked goat cheese,the macaroni gratin and a caesar salad. Everything was delicious!! I wanted to go there again but my friend insisted on trying different places. I almost went there by myself when she left because it was so good. It is across from the Bellagio fountain so besides people watching (which you can do anywhere in Vegas) there was always a little fountain show going on. Highly recommend!"
1,"I was going to be in town on business for a couple days and this time I took some time for me to actually explore a little more of Charlotte. Pure Pizza popped up on my radar and I knew I would have to try them out. Especially since they were in one of my favorite places: the 7th Street Public Market.\n \nI went for the Pesto Pizza. Typically when I'm trying a new pizza joint I go for the trusty margherita pizza to get a nice base line of what a shop can do, but I switched it up this time and was very glad I did. I paid for my pie, got my number and found a seat in the dining area. Not too long a wait before it was time for me to dig in.\n\nThe pizza crust was crisp, but not charred. While I don't mind charred, but I know some pizza patrons do. Plenty of cheese & pesto drizzle to go around on each slice. If I ever make it back here with colleagues, I will definitely recommend getting several small pizzas so we can try a variety of flavors. I almost went back every day while I was in Charlotte, but I had to be fair and explore other options."
1,Great little place by Galaxy Theatre. Makes for a low key date night.  Yummy pad Thai and pad se-ew.
0,"i just don't see the big deal with this place. i've heard about it for years and was actually excited to go here. and i do love to bet on the horses as well and they have off track betting. yes, there is alot of sports memorabilia, mostly college. lots of helmets in display cases. the bar itself feels dirty to me. it's dark and no frills at all. the tables and chairs are below average or average at best. the tvs suck. they have small tvs up towards the ceiling so your neck is cranked up. they have 2 large tvs that are kind of dark. there will usually be a couple of groups hogging those 2 big tvs, so if you want to see your game, you'll be stuck looking up at a small tv and those are usually a little dark or blurred. they have a separate area for horse betters. i don't like that they charge you to sit in that room. the only place to sit in that room is at your own personal tv like the 2nd level at turf paradise, so they charge you to sit there. the food was ok. we were there on a friday for all you can eat fish. well, after ordering several rounds, we found out it wasn't all you can eat. we had to pay for all of it. come on, 99% of places have it as all you can eat fish fry on fridays. the beer was cheaper. i have no idea about mixed drinks. the only reason i would go here is to walk in, look at the memorabilia and leave. also, if you have a large group, i would recommend somewhere else. these tables are small and you would have to push together a few tables. the bar only has a small area of tables."

After these few incidents, I will not use any cab in Charlotte especially from the airport.\nA month ago, I called a cab to the airport early in the morning.  I made it very clear that I need the cab at my house at 6 am as I have a flt to fly out.  I asked if that was posssible, the operator said yes.  It was around midnight when I called.\nAt 6 am, I looked over the window, there was no cab.  6:05 no cab.  I got nervous as I was catching a flt to go to work.  I called yellow cab again, then she said there was no cab available.  I screamed as I would miss my flight to work.  She said she was trying but she had never notified me earlier.  I couldn't wait as the clock ticks. I had no other choice but to wake up my neighbor to give me a ride.  Thank God, with the kindness of my neighbor and my professionalism, I ran and ran and ran inside the airport and finally got to the gate be the last one before they closed the door.\n3 weeks ago, I came home at the airport to take a cab since my house was within 3-4 miles.  It was my first time using a cab.  I didn't know how much here but I had in San Francisco for less than $15 (with airline discount, they charge $12).  So I thought I better to use a cab instead of calling friends around.  I need to go to my house to get my car key then to the hotel right by the airport to get my car.  I explained very clearly to the cab driver who said nothing about the charge.  He didn't turn on the meter as I thought charge shown on meter.  As I got to my house, he said he would charge me double.  I asked how much and why double and what was supposed to be?  He started to yell at me.  Finally, I was charged $28 for a 6 miles ride.  I didn't know if that was acceptable.  I said  to myself I learned, if he overcharged me, I treated that as donation and God blesses.  I was too busy.\nLast night, I took a cab again from CLT airport just to go home that was really 4 miles.  The driver was acting like a wild animal, very unfriendly, talking everything I had no idea what he was talking.  He kept saying I had no idea how long people were waiting.  I asked what people?  Other passengers?  They were behind me and shouldn't be longer than me.  Or the drivers?  I even asked him to take me back to the airport if he didn't want to have the business.  He was driving crazy and I hoped there was a police car closed by.  Unfortunately when we want to see a cop, they were not there but when we didn't want to see them, there was always one.\nFinally, I was safe home.  I still could not understand what was going wrong with these cab drivers.  If someone can help to explain to me.\nBTW, if these cab drivers hate their work, find another one.  I was still figuring out what was their problem.  Perhaps, a few miles were too short the trip?  They were looking for someone who needs to go 100 miles or to another city?  For long ride, people will rent a car for $20-$30 a day and gas.  People need a cab if that is more economic than renting a car for a day.  Anyway, at least I understand why they are still driving an angry cab cos they don't know how to do maths."
0,"HORRIBLE Service and food!!! I would NOT recommend this restaurant! In fact, I would tell you to make reservations at many other fine dining establishments in Las Vegas. Ivo Angelov, the General Manager should be fired for the way he treats his customers. I am from San Francisco and enjoy fine dining and would definitely rate this as the worst experience I've encountered. On top of that, many in our party got sick from the horrible food and ruined our trip! STAY AWAY from Le Cirque in Las Vegas!"
1,"This terrific neighborhood steakhouse and butcher shop is a great alternative to the more upscale spots in SouthPark and Uptown, and a wonderful addition to South Charlotte's restaurant scene. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there a few weeks back, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Our filets were cooked to perfection, the salads were crisp and delicious, and our sides of Mac & Cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were both outstanding.\n\nFor a restaurant its size, Block & Grinder boasts one of the best wine selections around, along with a knowledgeable waitstaff who can confidently recommend the best pairing for each meal. There's also a terrific selection of local craft beers on tap, and a small bar for when you just want to drop in for some drinks and an appetizer after work.\n\nBesides the wonderful meal and attentive service, what I liked most about this place was its casual, laid-back atmosphere. Feel free to leave the jacket at home -- you'll do fine in jeans and a polo shirt. It's the trendy neighborhood spot you'd expect to find in Dilworth or Uptown, yet only minutes from the Arboretum and Stonecrest. \n\nMy wife and I will definitely be making another trip to Block & Grinder -- maybe next time, we'll even take home some chops for the grill."
1,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  I have been going to Pro Nails for the past 7 years and couldn't be happier.  My sisters and I enjoy going to get pedicures together.  Not only are they affordable, but who doesn't enjoy a good hot rock massage???  We also always get designs done on our toes and they do an amazing job.  Tracy (the owner) is absolutely delightful and always remembers our names, gives us discounts on various occasions, and gives us Christmas gifts!  The salon is clean, the staff are kind, and I have never been disappointed.  I recommend this place to all the closes people in my life and everyone who has given them a chance won't go anywhere else now!  Check them out.  I assure you, you will not leave disappointed!"
0,"Definitely gone downhill since my last visit. Enough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a review. I usually get the southwest chicken salad which is, or WAS I should say, amazing! They no longer carry it, or several of their other choice selections they once offered, so I settled on an old favorite, the vegetarian greifo. Unfortunately, it was lacking toppings since they've changed their ordering/service style, and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on. Pretty disappointed. Hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their name rather than actual product."
1,"I've been to Jacks about, eh, a hundred times now. A ton of games and my friends are use to me running out of change and asking for dollars by now lol.  If you go during the week, you can typically grab a table and have a chill time. If you go on a Friday or Saturday the place is usually rocking with karoake and the bar is packed. If I head that way on the weekends, I try to go early then hop somewhere else - the place gets slammed... no, no I mean SLAMMED. After this point, good luck getting to the bar for a drink. And you could throw a rock and hit a drunk person easily. \n\nThe patio is awesome and I love heading there in the summer. Jacks serves brunch on Sundays and doggies are welcome as well so pretty cool spot for that. Yet I've gone a few times at night and ordered food. Make sure you're not in a hurry as the food tends to take a bit longer. I've never had this issue during the day so not sure what the deal is at night. \n\nBut other than that, if you are looking for a liquid dinner, a fun game spot or a place with high energy, you found it here."
1,"This is my most favorite buffet in Vegas and I prefer this over the buffet at Wynn hands down! Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmo hotel and you will probably recognize this place because everyone loves taking photos in the life sized heels that are around the buffet.\n\nI came here for lunch and it was about $40 for lunch. It was a little cheaper than the Wynn buffet but if you want to go more all out, you can get bottomless mimosas for $9 more. I dont know why you would do that if you are already going to stuff yourself with allll those other items. Lunch closes at 3pm on the weekends and dinner starts at 5pm so you cant really linger so you can get the best of both worlds, unless you plan on staying for 4 hours at this place haha. The wait was longer than Wynn and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the front and finally sit down. It is beautiful inside as well and the chairs are comfy. I like the Wynn decorations better though.\n\nThe food is sooo delicious. There is so much variety but I really liked their tacos and their meat. I can describe all the food that they have but looking through photos will give you a better idea. I absolutely LOVEEEEE their dessert selection. They have so many desserts, cakes, macarons, GELATOOOO, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, and sooo much more. Surprisingly my most favorite item was the yogurt and blueberries in a cup made out of chocolate. I can literally eat everything! I felt like Willy Wonka when he drank the tea and bit into the cup in the field of candy. I probably ate 5 of those. I ended up just asking if they can just give me blueberries and they were more than happy to give it to me. The desserts and food here are just so much better than Wynn and next time I go to vegas, I am just gonna head straight here :)\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Save room for dessert! The selection is wonderfully delicious!\n2) Food coma will hit you bad. Along with lack of sleep, the food coma knocked one of my friends out at the table. It was pretty hilarious.\n3) Enjoy!!!"
0,"The owners of this place used to have the some of the best Thai food around.  For some reason the quality of the Thai place they also own next door has gone down hill.  I was hoping that when they branched out to Vietnamese that it might be better.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The pho broth was really bland.  My fiances vermicelli was a bit better than my Pho."
0,The booze is too expensive.\n\nIt gets waay too cramped and old too quick\n\nThe funny part of the ghost bar is drunk people trying to break the glass floor..
1,"Two words: Adobada Torta. If you have not tried Phat Phranks, it is imperative that you do so ASAP! The chile verde burrito is also wonderful - a little spice, and lots of flavor! The fish tacos are to die for, and if you like authentic Mexican So-Cal style, this is the place to go. \n\nBesides having a small-town Restaraunt atmosphere in a big city, Frank seriously makes every guest feel welcome. If it isn't right, he will make it right immediately. It's always refreshing to see the owner working behind the counter, ensuring everything is just right for his guests."
1,"Everyone in this salon is the BEST! Always willing to go above and beyond for any client, beautiful salon, and lovely ladies. Candace has been doing my hair for a few years now and I wouldnt go to anyone else! :-)"
0,"I've eaten at the Sahara location and been satisfied with Sammy's before.  This being my first visit to this location I expected around the same enjoyment.  Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.\n\nThe menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  \""Tapas\"" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.\n\nNo comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.\n\nFor those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci \""you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin\"" hahaha.  Overall, just didn't stick out as a place I would ever return to for pizza and its in the freakin name of the restaurant.... come on!!!"
1,"My 2 boyz and I really like this place. We share an order of their magnificent Meatballs, have a little conversation and then call it an evening."
0,"I went to Down Under the other night with my boyfriend for our date night. We've worked in the service industry for years so we hold the bar pretty high on food and service. We ordered a cheese plate, the Barramundi and some wine.\n\nWhen the cheese plate came out I almost laughed. Everything on there that wasn't cheese clearly came from a can and the cheeses looked like the ones you can buy pre-cut from Fry's or wherever. Fry's cheese plate may actually be a cut above what we received.\n\nAfter the blasphemy that was our cheese plate, we were both a little nervous to see the Barramundi. Barramundi is supposed to be a tender, flaky, white fish. What we got was a sad piece of ocean chum that looked like it came out of a microwave. To say it was bad isn't saying enough. It was totally devoid of texture and taste.\n\nTo round out the evening, our wines (and the selection of wines) were mediocre at best and the service was not worth mentioning.\n\nAll in all, this was the most disappointing dining experience and waste of $75 that I've ever spent since moving to Arizona."
1,"Blush seems to get a lot less attention than some of the other clubs around, which is fine if that means no cover and free champagne to soften us up for the bandit prices at Tryst.  It's actually quite nice inside.  Definitely smaller than the real crazy Vegas spots, with a dance floor that doesn't get too empty or too crowded, and a gorgeous lit outdoor patio.  The staff is courteous and the man who recruited us for free champagne shuttled us over to Tryst when we wanted to switch over there.  Because nice as Blush is, it isn't a full-night commitment.  If you're going all the way to Vegas, you can't very well leave without getting ripped off and elbowed in the face a few times - though on second thought, that doesn't sound too bad."
1,Excellent sushi. The service was outstanding. Quality and freshness superb! Will be going back very soon to this neighborhood gem!
1,"Watch noodles being pulled while you wait! lol \nThe thick noodles are the best, they are long, mis-shaped, chewy and just plain wonderful. However, the real gems on the menu have nothing to do with noodles! Their you choy (their spelling) and the green beans with garlic are phenomenal. The you choy is served in a delicate light broth, and steaming hot. The green beans are stir-fried whole with large cloves of garlic, worth the long drive to Mesa. \n\nThe service is not great, at all, but if you are looking for good customer service and cheery employees, you are shopping in the wrong plaza. Its part of the fun though right?"
1,"4 1/2 star!\n\nStayed here for my best friend's anniversary! We booked the fountain view room! The room is nice luxurious but traditional! The fountain view is awesome with music played on TV so you can enjoy the show from your room! \nThe casino is beautiful and classy... We got great luck here so it made our stay more pleasant! The hotel's atrium is beautiful!\n\nWe had dinner at chef Todd English's restaurant, Olives... Expensive and disappointed! The patio dinning area with direct fountain view was a highlight of our expensive meal! The circuit du soleil's O is a must see... It was amazing!\n\nWe saw quite a few celebrities during our stay here... Laker's players, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce...\n\nWhy 4 1/2 star?\nAlthough the hotel is beautiful, overall the decor is a bit old school comparing to other hotels in this area... And it is really expensive!\n\nDefinitely will stay here again!"
0,"A young guy w dark hair seemed interested in helping us but my husband said he wanted to take a minute to look. The guy said sure and went in the back. Quite a while went by but finally an even younger kid came out. I asked some questions and he said,  \""hold on I'll be right back.\"" After about 10 minutes of standing there with my questions unanswered we went to leave. Before we got to the door an older heavy set man came out and asked if he could help. I explained that I was already dealing with the kid. \"" oh, he's back there eating.\"" Was the reply. I looked at my husband in disbelief. Then I re-asked the older man the questions I had. He answered all of our questions but seemed very bored with us. He then said HE would be back and went into the back room- probably to eat. So we went to another bike shop and bought four really awesome bikes. The other bike shop made us feel happy and comfortable with our purchase. They also had a much bigger selection. Won't ever recommend bike world!"
1,"Nice little farmers market with lots of variety! It's especially great for a unique lunch spot complete with assorted food trucks and desserts galore. \n\nWorking downtown I sometimes am at a loss for where to eat. Casinos sometimes lose their appeal and lots of other restaurants are overpriced. This farmers market is just a few blocks from the Fremont Street Experience, probably a 7-8 minute walk from Golden Nugget and offers fresh produce and an affordable meal, depending on the food trucks that arrive.\n\nFrom fresh fruit, veggies, freshly baked cookies, herbs and spices....the market has no lack of variety. Housed in an old bus depot, the maze-like hallway takes you through the sort of tight space. At full capacity it must get a little stuffy! There are a few tables outside to enjoy your purchases. The day we went Fukuburger, Rusty Pickle and Grouchy John's were all in attendance.\n\nNice idea for a sunny day. Enjoy it before it hits 100 degrees!"
1,"OMG I try to watch my sugar and fat intake and this fat free frozen yogurt does the trick for me a couple of times a week!!!  Ive tried other Frozen Yogurt places and Yogurtland has THE BEST flavors hands down.  I always get Birthday Cake Frozen Yogurt and Double Cookies and Cream Yogurt side by side.  Not too sweet like other places.  Its perfect!  Doesn't have an artificial taste.  I find it hard to believe it's really fat free :)  They now have #keylime back.  PLEASE KEEP IT!!!!! This should be on the menu EVERYDAY!!!!\nClean place, crowded most days but they get you in and out.  Great selection of toppings, always clean and the staff is amazing!"
1,AMAZING! Not much to look at it doesn't matter when the food is perfect. I live close so I will be going ALL THE TIME. Such a great find!
0,Stood in line waiting for a quart of mac and cheese ($20!) and two dozen cookies for 20+ minutes. Bums in my personal space reaching over my shoulder demanding water from the cashier during checkout. I frequented Panera a lot when I lived in the midwest. It's not the same at this location. Will not return.
0,Very so so burgers. Best to head elsewhere for a burger. Lots of other options. Limited options. Service could easily be improved. Once at this place was enough. I won't be back
1,"My wife and I had to go here and try the Frozen hot chocolate, little did we know that it would take us a month to try them all.  We had the ffresh fruit on top of the wonderful frozen chocolate and we enjoyed it as an appitizer, to heck with waiting for dessert because it was exactly what we wanted on a day in the mid 90's.  We will be suggesting it every chance we get, and cant wait for our next chance to enjoy it."
1,Always love this Dominoe's!!! They deliver super fast and are always super nice! Their new pan pizza is fastly becoming our favorite. Their stuffed cheesy breads are sooo delicious and their chicken bites are yummy too!!  They have defenitly come a long! Keep up the delicious work Big D!!!
1,Bartender was awesome to help find a kind of beer we liked to drink.. Gave us a few beers to sample to find one we liked.  Great atmosphere
1,"Being in Edinburgh for a few days this week, I was bowled over by the choice of great drinking and dining options available. \n\nWe were at The Voodoo Rooms for an event downstairs and throughout this, the bar staff were efficient, effective, friendly and welcoming to our group. We had some cocktails in their 'Speakeasy' area, while also enjoying some food from the wide ranging and well priced dinner menu. All 3 of us went for the burgers which were obviously freshly made - plus they had a succulent flavour and texture that you don't get in normal run of the mill bars. I also liked the fact that although the Speakeasy bar was small, they still kept a good range of beers like Brooklyn in it as opposed to offering just a limited supply.\n\nOne of the bonuses of the Voodoo rooms is the fact that it's a labyrinth of rooms with loads of varying entertainment going on in different areas.  Their main bar upstairs is a real classic, quality long seating bar with a great vibe - the sort of place I'd love to spend more time just chilling out and relaxing in the afternoon with a nice pint and the newspaper. \n\nI also really enjoyed their 'Ballroom' which had an excellent band playing 60's and 70's psychedelic music - this to me was the icing on the cake of an evening spent across all the bars in this venue. \n\nI love places that are big enough to have loads of flow and give you the option to move around like you're at a house party, with loads of leisure and socialising options available - Voodoo rooms has this in abundance so check it out!"
0,"No one felt like going out in the heat, so we ordered in a pizza - thin crust, mushrooms, pepperoni and garlic. The phone service was great, the delivery time SUPER-fast,even though it was the lunch rush.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the pizza wasn't really all that, in my opinion. The toppings and flavor were alright, though quite salty -- the sauce was sweeter rather than zestier, but the garlic was cooked well and the pepperoni was sufficiently savory.\n\nThe cut it in squares (like Marco's, which is way better, IMO) and I do like that kind of cut.\n\nBut I didn't care for the crust. It's definitely a Chicago-style crust -- not chewy, not crispy, kind of airy and bready, even the thin crust. I think if that's your thing, you'll like this pizza -- it's just not my jam.\n\nThey're pretty pricey for pizza, so beware.  $17 for a large, plus $2 per topping. By the time we were done (added on cheesebread at the last minute, but received cheesesticks), it was a $33 pizza.\n\nMeh."
1,"love the location, love the soft sno, love that youre open on sundays but i beg of you: bring back polar berry!!!"
1,"What a fantastic find! Great toy store with so many selections in every age range. They have classic style toys for a toddler: riding/wheeled items, balls, dolls and building sets in every variety (duplo, blocks, magnetic).  Plus the bigger kid section with electronic games, board games, educational items, and kid crafting (yarn, jewels, rubber bands, paints, etc). Modest selection of reading books but many more activity/coloring books-an impressive variety with items I've not seen elsewhere. There is also a small selection of decor type items for a kids room or clothing accessories. \n\nYou can find many sales items and range of prices, but to give you an idea--$80 for large toy set, $25 for block set, $2-5 for small take and toss toys. Overall the prices range from mid to high, but quality is higher than you would get at local Wal-Mart. Totally worth it. \n\nGo, you won't be disappointing."
0,"The pictures looked great and given several of the reviews, I was really looking forward to visiting OBH. It was mediocre at best. Hopefully I was just there on a bad day. There were only a few tables with customers at 7 AM  and one waitress. Just nothing special at all. The gravy on the side for $1.50 would have filled a shot glass and not much more.\n\n The highlight of the meal was the hot sauce sitting on the table. I have used this sauce before (made in Gilroy, CA the garlic capital of the world, but a pepper base) and have not seen it for about 3 or 4 years, it was excellent."
0,"I went here on Christmas Eve for lunch because I was always curious about it. Plus, the Chinese food choices in central Phoenix are pretty sparse. I would actually give this place more like 2-1/2 stars. I liked the tofu and pork clay pot we ordered. But the pork and kabocha squash dish was waaaay too salty. I feel like it was a spice, not MSG, that was the culprit. Either way, I had to scarf down a lot of water every time I ate some. We also had fried green beans with XO sauce, which is pretty simple to make. I know they have a buffet too and judging by what I saw during my stroll, the food seemed like nothing special. I did crack up at the using a tortilla container for the steamed rice. \n\nI could see myself going here if I was really craving Chinese food for dinner or lunch. But I'd get it to go rather than eat it there. The inside is the usual old-school Chinese restaurant decor with booths and tables. As someone from the Bay Area and who grew up in a Chinese household, I could definitely say I've had better. I know the owner is supposedly a chef with 30 years experience so who knows, maybe I went during an off day."
1,"For what they advertise, they knock it out of the park with their Torta's.  I am sure there are places in Mexico that can rival them, but in the US I have yet to find a place that can rival the variety and fair prices of these tortas.  I ordered one of their new asada tortas served with salad and grilled peppers and freshly made salsa all was delicious.  The bread they use for the torta is really fresh and taste great.  love the avocados they use as well.  My wife ordered the first torta on the menu torta dela reyes filled with egg, chorizo, avocado, sausages, and pork slices.  Very filling torta for a great price, had left  overs for a filling breakfast the next morning."
0,"I hate to rain on the love parade for this place, but my husband and I went last night for pedicures.  I called earlier in the day and MADE APPOINTMENTS.  When we got there we waited 20 minutes to even get to the pedi chairs.  My husband waited another 10 minutes before a technician even started with him.  During the service she cut his toe!  The upside of his service was that she gave an amazing leg and foot massage.  \n\nNow back to my experience.....basically my service didn't begin until 25 minutes AFTER I got seated in the pedi chair (did I mention we had appt. for 5pm)!  45 minutes after our stated appointment time, I finally saw my technician.  Unfortunely we had dinner reservations and had to leave in a limited time, so I basically got shafted on the massage!\n\nThe staff was apologetic about the timing, but first impressions are a killer.  I really don't think we will be going back.\n\nSorry Biagio:("
1,"3.5 stars\n\nI ordered the Full Montagu. The first half of the sandwich was good.  But after eating half of it, I got pretty sick of it and it felt really heavy. I ended up just throwing away the second half of the sandwich. It's good, but not THAT good. Lines were pretty long, but moved quickly so the wait wasn't too bad."
0,"We have been going to Madhouse coffee on Eastern for about a year now. After getting stale pastries and watered down coffee from the manager who works on Saturdays,  I was concerned when two of their best employees left. \n\nWhen I called the store to find out when the owner was going to be at the Eastern location, I was unaware that the manager's relative put my call on speaker phone so the manager could hear my comments without my permission. \n\nThe next day, the manager confronted me in front of 10 customers and asked if I was the one who left a message to speak to the owner.  I was not prepared for the conversation and nor did I want to voice my concerns to someone who was looking for a fight and in a crowded coffee shop.\n \nIf you don't care how hard you work for your money, then you can continue buying your coffee fix from them. But if you want to be respected for your business, then find another place to purchase your fix. This place does not care about customers since the manager was being confrontational with me in front of customers and lied about the product being fresh. She can't even make a good cup of coffee.  Customers shouldn't be expected to defend themselves if they have a problem with product they are paying for. \n\nSide note: the owner did call and try to make a mends but it was a little too late for that. With their prices, its not worth it."
1,Zoo lights is just so cool. They really do a great job. Every year gets better. I did notice it seemed like a few things were missing from years past but they also had a large light display out on the lake with a big globe of lights right in the middle. Every 15 minutes there was a synchronized light show. So this newer edition was pretty cool. Also I did not know about the snow slide. This was really fun. For $3 a person per ride or you could buy multiple rides if you wanted you climb to the top of a hill basically and the put you in a cloth covered inter-tube and while keeping your feet up they push you off the edge and down about a 200 foot slide. Wow was that a lot of fun. I could have ridden that 10 more times. I will when we go next year. Don't forget the talking giraffe. All the little kids were talking with the giraffe and when she said the random fact that she weights over 2000 lbs one the little kids pipes in with Your fat. Oh the things kids say.\nThis has to be one of the few zoos in the country that does this and I thing it is great. My girlfriend is a zoo member so she gets free passes every year so we will be back. I am heading to the snow slide first thing.
1,"Newby's performed a vehicle inspection on my used car.  I was so impressed with their service I thought I would write a review. They were swamped with customers but fit me in for a quick inspection. The high temperature this day was around 120 degrees due to a heat wave. There was no room to sit inside so I waited outside. Julie, the customer service rep, bought me a diet coke from the vending machine. Everyone was nice and courteous. James, the technician, went through the inspection, point by point, with me. Elvis, their furry mascot, was a friendly door greeter.  Family-owned business. Long-time Henderson/Vegas residents. I was very impressed and will go back for other repairs."
0,"I got a good deal on a Groupon for the new Quaker Steak & Lube so we stopped in for a late lunch last week.  There were only a few patrons in the restaurant at that time.  It was so slow, in fact, that it seemed that we were a bother to the hostess because she really couldn't seem less interested in seating us.  Thankfully, our server made up for her shortcomings, plus some.  He was fantastic.  Very attentive and very personable.\n\nIf only the food was as good as the service.  Ugh...such a let down!  I ordered Mild Wings.  The sauce was ok, but the skin was too soft.  My son got the Medium spiced wings and he said that they were ok, but that he's had better.  My husband ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and said it was acceptable.  Nothing special, but not terrible either.  He also got a small order of Cajun spiced boneless wings.  I tried them and the flavor was NOT appealing to me at all.  The one saving grace for the entire meal were the onion rings.  A tad too salty, but perfectly crispy and not greasy.  My son and I liked them very much.\n\nThe decor is a bit gaudy, but I'm fairly certain that's by design.  I'm glad that we were seated at a booth because the plastic lawn chairs at the standard tables would have been very uncomfortable.  The only downside to the booth was that I was a bit grossed out by how filthy the framed picture was that was hanging over our booth.  It looked like some kids smeared their dirty hands all over the picture.  Seriously, it was disgusting and it even had an odor.  And speaking of odors...there was an odor in the restaurant that reminded of me the remnants of water damage.  It was really off-putting.\n\nSo...it wasn't a good lunch at all and we won't be back.  It's a shame because the concept of the restaurant is cool and the menu \""looked\"" great."
0,"This evening my friend and I thought, \""let's go to bonefish grill\"" we researched it on yelp and the presentation looked awesome.  Unfortunately the presentation and the waiter  were the only thing awesome. \n\nI tried the \""Ahi Bowl\"" and my friend tried the\""Chilean Sea Bass\"" the Ahi  bowl was a bit off in color and the Sea Bass tasted like it was soaked in petrol. \n\nOn the bright side we did enjoy each others company and a great bottle ofSanta Margarita Pinot Grigio!!!\nThat's really all that mattered!!!\n\nFood is definitely subpar!!!\n\nDamn I really did want to like this place!!!!"
0,"Buyer Beware! This company was contracted by the insureance company to cover a flooded basement.  The ground level house was boarded off (hard screwed to walls to build a new wall) to avoid contractor traffic upstairs.  The contractor expressed dissatisfaction with the fact it was walled off.  At a later time, the contractor broke in to the upstairs to measure carpet and never requested access.  In the process, they destoyed a dry walled wall and knocked wall decorations to the groud as they demoed the temporay wall.  They claim to have called and got no answer, however they left no messages.  This company is a horrible contractor with poor ethics.  Do not let them anywhere near your home.  They deserve 0 stars but the system forced me to 1."
0,"\""See her before she blows!, ow wait she already does!\"" \n\nI went to this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel close enough to the strip at a reasonable price, granted we didn't do alot of investigating before we went here, so that was pretty much our fault. So in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms. We checked in after having reserved our room on the drive towards Vegas, upon getting there we were automatically turned off by this hotels overall presence. The parking was confusing and there was no one to guide us through the maze in which we found ourselves driving. Finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structure and checked in. We were forced t wait as our rooms were being cleaned and 20 mins later we were given our keys and told what elevator to take, apparently our party was split 4 of us were forced into a smoking room (more like smoking floor, it was truly horrific) that was just about soaked in smoke, it was as if the maid had forgot to use air sprays either that or the smoke was so strong the spray didn't even stand a chance. Our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator. That alone was a huge inconvenience, we ended up going back and forth several times until we had had enough. We complained and eventually, 1 and a half days into our 3 day weekend, our both party's were placed on the same smoking floor. Apparently non smoking rooms are requested more, as it is a hotel geared more towards those with kids. As if that was not bad enough the view from the room was horrific, all you see is the sad gray roof down below of and the parking garage in the distance. The hallways had missing segments of the ceiling, which showed off the buildings rusting water pipes. Which only deterred us from drinking any of the tap water or from showering in excess. \n\nAs for the amenities, seeing as how I was 20 when I went on this trip I was not allowed to enjoy the gambling experience while in Vegas, therefore I can not really comment on this. However my friends that did end up gambling at the hotel said it was \""whatevers\"", the drinks were alittle on the light side and the games just didn't seem \""lucky\"". On the opposite end of the casino level lies the \""The Buffet\"", now no Vegas hotel would be complete without a Buffet and the Circus Circus is no different however don't go into \""The Buffet\"" expecting a 5 star gourmet dining experience, in fact don't even expect a 2 star dining experience. Overall the food choices were varied from American cuisine to Italian to even Mexican, however the quality was about as great as any \""Home Town Buffet\"" and if you've ever been to one you know what I mean. The food lacked flavor and was designed for a bland American palate, my friends had to cover their food in salsa and salt just to make it worth eating. If you do decide to eat here go during breakfast as it seems to be when they serve their better prepared options. Yet how difficult is it to scramble an egg and heat up some pre-made sausage, not very I'd assume. \n\nIn the end the Circus Circus is a good hotel to see if your traveling with Children. Its also great if you want to see an old classic before the dynamite is called in. However do not fear when that day does come there are still plenty of great hotels I'd suggest for parents, \""Mandalay Bay\"", \""Excalibur\"" or \""Treasure Island\"" all 3 themed hotels offer afew more options then \""Circus\"" and aren't as \""aged\"". As for booking plan in advance and seek out promotional offers on-line (found 3 when I got back home, which could have saved us about 112.00 [each room].....darn!) Also always request non smoking rooms close to each other or gathering your party might end up a daily rusense. The buffets okay in the morning and around brunch time but avoid the dinner menu, its your chance to sample what you missed if you would have stayed at the \""Hard Rock\"" (GREAT FOOD, awesome adult atmosphere). In the end I CAN NOT recommend this decrepit old building. The whole stay felt very depressing and the staff came off unfriendly and uncaring really. Getting an extra 30 mins to leave our room was a HUGE issue, they wanted to charge for an additional day (on both rooms). If your staying here I'd recommend booking someplace else, this hotel is on its way out the door. Ow and its not even THAT close to the strip, about something like 1-2 miles away. Walking from Circus to Mandalay bay was grueling and in the end we were forced to get a taxi."
1,"Hondoctors are awesome, they worked on my car never tried to Rip me off like other mechanics, you can trust them good people there!"
1,"Not a buffet, but really good restaurant overall. Definitely not a \""five-star\"" establishment in the traditional sense, but if you want good Chinese food at good prices with a true Chinese restaurant feel, this is a good place."
1,"Shibuya's vegetarian tasting menu is among the best, healthiest and most affordable ($55 per person, six courses) of the fine vegetarian cuisines in Las Vegas.  Tonight the two of us selected different dishes for 4 of the 6 courses and shared them.   The other 2 courses (edamame and sushi) were the same for each person.  Portions were generous, so it seemed like ten-dish menu.\nFive stars for balance of taste, variety and freshness of ingredients, actual choices on the menu, preparation and presentation.  Seaweed salad tasting was especially good : 4 different types beautifully presented on a bed of sand and sea shells.  Whatever you do, don't miss this desert : jasmine anmitsu, and be ready with your camera.  \nWe booked early, and received excellent service from the friendly and helpful wait staff."
0,"Believe the reviews. Think I'm finally done with this place. I usually just get brown rice & teriyaki chicken, so I'm typically spared by the fact that they're always out of everything. I always attributed it to the fact that they get a heavy lunch rush, and just don't handle it well.\n\nToday, i got there at 11:30 after working a very early morning, expecting piping hot pans of (relatively) fresh-looking food. To my amazement, it was the worst i've ever seen it here; every pan had barely 2 or 3 scoops of food, and it was all picked over with barely any meat in anything, with sauce burnt to the bottom of the pan. It immediately became apparent that they had just reheated last night's leftovers, and hadn't finished making new food for the day.\n\nAbsolutely appalling. Not that I should have high hope for a freaking Panda Express... but good grief guys."
1,Love the convenience of the redbox and inexpensive products! Staff is always helpful when i go in....
0,"The food at Frida's is LAME. Not so bad in the sense that you'll want to vomit, but certainly bad enough that you won't even think twice about throwing away your leftovers instead of taking them home. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it really is some of the most mediocre Mexican food I've ever had, and that you honestly can get more flavorful Latin cuisine at Taco Bell. \n\nTo start, the meat is dry and totally free of any significant spices or marinade, leaving you with a stringy and uninspired base for the dish. The tortillas are tough to bite through, even when soaked in the flavorless liquids that adorn your plate. The beans taste like they came straight from a can bought at the dollar store, and the vegetables aren't all that fresh. And because every dish they make is incredibly tasteless, Frida's will load up on obscene amounts of cheese to compensate. The cheese is equally as hopeless, tasting like nothing but chewy grease. \n\nFrida's only redeeming quality is the atmosphere - a large, well-decorated 2-story loft - unless you're not a fan of looking at a giant picture of woman with a unibrow while you eat, I suppose. All in all, dining here is a horrendous, underwhelming experience. Don't waste your money. Casa de Lara is 2 blocks away."
0,"The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment.\nI have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).\nWe sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.\nI had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables."
1,"I wish I could give Grand Lux 4.5 stars! \nI love coming to Grand Lux because they have a large eclectic menu and the Venetian location is open 24 hours! \nAsian nachos are ammaazziinngggllyy gooodddd!! \nSo is the Maui ribeye! And their sticky toffee bread pudding!! \nThe food is consistently good whether its extremely busy or at its off hours...\n\nThe decor reminds me of a higher version of cheesecake factory, and the service is prompt and friendly."
1,"i have to break with my peers and say Luxor was pretty cool. while i can understand why some don't like it, i can say i really enjoyed it. some points of interest: \n\n* we got an AWESOME rate booking with the EDC groups. and when i say, awesome, i mean A-W-E-S-O-M-E! almost 50% off anywhere else. PLUS, this was a fight night (the night PacMan was robbed), and there were a couple of high profile conventions too. \n\n* the layout, although different having an open atrium thingy, was not too difficult to traverse. after a couple trips, i knew my way around.\n\n* the pools were cool. not too hard to find seats out there on a saturday afternoon. the cocktailetresses were on top of things. music wasn't bad.\n\n* check in was originally slated for 3p. we got in at 10a. after checking back at 11a, we got a room. sweet. \n\n* the room was clean, on a floor i requested and the view was of the pool. i didn't even have to drop a tip to the front desk. the bathrooms were very impressive. not like what others have mentioned. plenty of stainless towels and functioning toilet/shower. \n\n* beds were comfy, plenty of seating and writing space. we had a flat screen and lots of storage. \n\nother than the location being at the far south end of the Strip (hence no 5th star) and a weird gravitationally non-compliant elevator, absolutley NO quams on this hotel. and the drink coupons i put to use right after i got the bags down in the room. all 4 of them! we may consider coming back here."
1,"Love, love, love this buffet. Breakfast is by far my favorite meal of the day, and this buffet has an excellent selection.\n\nEverything was great, but the ham and cheese croissants were to die for and the chocolate chip cookies are awesome (ok, not really a breakfast food, but who can't eat a cookie anytime!).\n\nThis is the only Vegas buffet I've been to, but I've stopped looking - I need no other."
0,"My wife and I ate here the night we arrived in Vegas.  We were staying at the Excalibur so were looking for someplace close.  We didn't really have a good experience here.  The service was friendly.  No complaints there.  The free bread was okay.  Nothing special and really not much flavor.  The olive oil also seemed very bland and cheap.  This place is family style.  Each menu item has two choices for portion sizes - one that is to be shared by 2 people and another by like 4 or something.  The salad was definitely enough for 2+ people.  We got the Caeser salad.  It was really good.  For the meal, we settled on the Baked Ziti.  It was probably one of the worst baked zitis that I've had.  Very dry and bland.  Hardly any sauce or cheese.  Devoid of flavor.  Also, the portion was really good for 1 person.  My wife and I both agree on this.  Afterwards, we were both still hungry.  So, for the price, I don't think it was good.  For that price for Baked Ziti, I was expecting a large amount of pasta.  I've been served bigger portion sizes in the $10 range and this was like $20+ or something.  Maybe they were just having a bad night, but I wouldn't be in a rush to go back here again.  That's just me."
0,"This place was a disappointment, but I'm giving it an extra star for the cactus garden. Unfortunately, it was too darn hot to walk around in it. It was interesting to see the parts of the factory that were available for viewing, but after seeing behind-the-scenes shots of other candy factories on far too many Food/Travel Channel shows, I just kind of thought, \""That's it?\"" I don't know if it's worth the drive from the strip, but entry is free (as it should be). \nMy mother purchased an iced coffee from the chocolate shoppe at the end of the self-guided tour, but it was made from powder, including the \""cream.\"" I guess we expected more from a chocolate factory. \nThere weren't a lot of free samples and the chocolate they sell is pricey. $20 for a few bars? I don't think so."
1,"Toll. Ein total verrr\u00fccktes Hotel in Las Vegas. Im ersten Stock des Hotels fahren Gondeln und  der Aussenbereich ist dem Markusplatz in Venedig nachempfunden. Das Hotel ist mit riesig und bietet zum Shopping, Essen, Spielen einfach alles was man braucht. Die Zimmer sind der absolute Hammer."
1,"Great, fresh sushi at reasonable prices. All you can eat dinner for $26, plus free dessert to complete the meal. Only downsides to the AYCE is that 1) it doesn't include sashimi, and 2) if you don't finish everything you pay the $26 plus a charge for any remaining rolls. However, if you have one or two you that just can't handle they'll usually cut you slack. Service is decent and friendly. Overall a great hidden gem everyone should try."

1,"I came here on one of  my first days in Champaign, and I've been back several times since. The service has always been pretty good. I've only eaten there for lunch, and I like the deal with two rolls and a bowl of udon. To me, it's a lot of food for 8.99. \n\nI'm no sushi or udon expert, but I do think they taste really good, especially the udon. Nothing better than to slurp up the noodles on a cold winter's day. The main reason this place didn't get four stars was that I don't like the atmosphere. It's a little cramped. I don't like to feel like I'm sitting on top of my fellow diners. Also, they play Top 40 stuff, which isn't all that appealing to me. I guess they're going for a young feel, but I don't wanna hear that stuff all the time when I'm eating. I guess that makes me old and crotchety."
1,Not bad if you're looking for food late when the buffet and other restaurants are closed.  It's a little pricey compared to the food in the food court area however it wasn't bad.  I got the club sandwich and it was a huge portion.
0,"The problem with Nordstroms is you spend $$ for a nice shirt/pant/jeans and see 18 other people wearing the exact same thing in a span over the next 14 days. I prefer spending my money at places where things aren't mass \""over\""produced and expensive. For quality of the product to price, I would say Nordstroms is extremely poor.\n\nIf you think Nordstroms men's or woman's shoe selection is the largest ever...than you surely haven't been to LA, San Francisco, Miami, NYC or Chicago. \n\nBy the way, why are 1/2 the women shoes made of patent leather? I guess if you're a stripper, it's right up your alley."
1,"Whoever thought of dipping apples in Carmel and chocolate I praise you! Sure you just made your apple a day a bit unhealthier, but it's still an apple! \n\nRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory features a wide assortment of delicious chocolate candies, and YES chocolate covered apples and strawberries. Obviously invented by a choc-a-holic, this place is heaven for a out of the ordinary sweet tooth craving. This would be a great place to pick up a outside of the box gift, hint hint guys! What girl doesn't want some chocolate covered strawberries!"
0,"This would have been a one star review except the incredible management which comped our meal. Let me preface by saying we came here from a very poor experience in Tucson. Literally drove back home and decided to hop by for a meal end dessert, hoping to override a poor experience we'd just had.\nWell, unfortunately, it was \""not my day\"" for dining, and our experience here was pretty aweful. As I said, we stopped in for dessert. We were seated in surprisingly short time, considering the line and proposed \""20-minute\"" wait. However, despite our short wait, we were in there for 45 minutes. Yes, 45 minutes, for dessert. That is how much I ususally spend if I am chatty with friends for an entire meal.\nA friendly waitress greeted us and took our drink orders (Some Cherry Coke to compliment) We then waited quite some time for our \""official\"" waitress to come, and when she got there, she did not smile, say thank you for coming, or anything. We gave her our order and asked for a side of grenadine to make the cherry coke stronger. She obliged the grenadine and ran off with our order. We were not attended to until the dessert came out. I would have waited an hour for good, fresh, and warm dessert, but alas after about 10 minutes they came out. The White brownie dessert was cold, the other lukewarm. When she brought us a second cherry coke (which had no extra grenadine, despite the fact I had to order some earlier) My twin got her attention and said \""It's cold\"".  She did not say \""I'm so sorry\"" she just said \""Ok\"" and snatched, literally, the dessert from the table. She asked me if mine was too, I said it could use a little warmth, she took them both back. NO APOLOGY, no NOTHING. We waited another 10 or 15 minutes, and got warm dessert. DURING THIS ENTIRE TIME she talked and checked on the table across from us NONSTOP. We had to sit around with no soda, and had had the cold dessert for some time. We were relieved when they came back out perfectly warm, although there was more dark chocolate sauce on the white brownie this time. They were delightful! Finally, she checked on us, brought our bill again and I asked for a to-go for my bread pudding. I watched this woman bring out 5 other tables dishes, two to go boxes, and chat with the table opposite us 3 times. We were waiting for her also to take the card. FINALLY she came over, by this time I muttered \""about time\"" under my breath, thats how long it was! Another someodd minutes and we finally had the bill back. We were angry, we loved the food, but this woman had not SERVED us, so I wrote a big ZERO where the tip was. It would be different if she'd smiled at least ONCE or apologized for being so busy or had a good attitude, but this woman had a big frown the whole time. So we asked for a manager to tell them about this. She comped our meal, even though we were perfectly happy paying for the food and not the service. The food was delightful. I was very grateful for the dessert meal comp, but I will never go back again. This was pretty aweful in service. It should never take 45 minutes to get and eat a dessert. Period. It wouldnt be worth going back."
1,"I've passed by the school a few times during my treks downtown, but I had no idea it was such a hub of cultural activity.\n\nI was here for the Django Gypsy Jazz festival. The gallery and courtyard were used as a pre-function / cocktail area and also where we got our tickets. VegasJazz had set up some tables in the gallery with information about the local jazz community. The gallery walls are adorned with some gorgeous artwork - conversation starters for the many people who came to the festival. The auditorium was packed with chairs and dimly light, but this created a very intimate performance. In fact, at the end of the show, all the musicians came out into the audience and did an impromptu jam session, with everyone huddling around them and singing along.\n\nI enjoyed this venue very much and would love to come here again."
0,"I haven't been back, nor will I ever go back to Fitzgeralds.  Their New Years Eve event was the worst that I've ever attended.  I've been trying to get a refund of my ticket price because I didn't get even close to my money's worth due to a dangerously over capacity crowd, a glassware shortage, slow bartenders, and a \""breakfast buffet\"" that never materialized.  I've been trying to resolve this issue with the manager, Mike Palmer, and all he did was offer me a coupon to return and \""give Fitzgeralds another try\"".  The problem is that I don't want to go back and eat/drink in an establishment like Fitzgeralds.  I would simply like either the manager or the owner to call me, which I've requested at least a half dozen times since the event, but I still haven't heard from anyone.  Even if there is no refund, I would still like them to answer simple questions like why were the bartenders overserving patrons that night (I routinely saw single customers order 4 or more drinks at a time), how many tickets were sold vs. the max capacity of the venue, and what officials witnessed the crowd that night and deemed it safe to continue selling tickets or letting patrons enter the building.\n\nVery dissapointing customer service, very irresponsible way to run a bar/restaurant.  Very upset customers."
1,"ok... This is an awesome place. They are on the fourth floor of the Belks department store in the SouthPark mall.\n\nI dropped off a pair of cowboy boots to be re-healed.\nThey just didn't add new rubber to the heal, they removed and rebuilt the stack, replaced the rubber heal. Then they repaired some minor damage on the upper heal of the boot. And I got them back in the same week! All this was done for a VERY fair price. ( I wonder if they allow tipping. )\n\nI liked the job they did on my brown boots so much I dropped my black pair of boots for a little more extensive repair.\n\nThanks guys!"
1,"Brittney is amazing! My husband and I were very stressed looking for somewhere for our pups to go while we were on vacation. They had a blast with Brittney and she made us feel so comfortable leaving them in her home. You can tell she really loves animals. She sent regular texts, pictures and videos to update us. Then when we picked them up she gave us a framed picture of our dogs, treats, a thank you, had washed their bedding and given them each a bath! What more can you ask for? I will definitely be recommending these girls to friends and family."
1,"Offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. At Burger Bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. That's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful. \n\nVegas is great for people watching and Burger Bar is great for burger watching: take note as Lance from Des Moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette. \n\nYou'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. The Burger Bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. Do not be surprised by this. They don't eat there. It is just not possible. They're all amazing fit. \n\nAnyway, 5 stars for this combo:\n*  1/2 pound Angus Beef, medium rare\n* Whole Wheat bun\n* Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms\n* Caramelized Onions\n* Blue Cheese\n\nThe Burger Bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries."

1,"I've been here a few times and like it more and more each time I go.  The place is uber swank and great for people watching.  The bubbles, food and service aren't bad either.\n\nI've been told this place turns into an over priced and over hyped club filled with hookers and douches at night, so I've never been (ok maybe once).  For the most part this place has only had the pleasure of my patronage during non-peak times.  My wife and I love sippin the bubbles here and there is really no other place quite like it in the area.\n\nJust recently I found a coupon on Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) for a $50 certificate for $25.  SOLD!  My wife and I went on a Friday evening for some Champagne and dinner.  The Champagne was good as always, the bruschetta was ok and the burger was excellent - especially the fries.  Overall I was very very surprised with the quality, presentation and taste of their food stuffs.  I would definitely eat there again.  The menu had several other items that looked excellent and I would try them all.\n\nUnfortunately when places start throwing deals up on coupon sites it means they are on the outs.  I really hope that isn't the case with Narcisse because it brings a level of uniqueness and character to the Quarter."
1,"The tea and chai are excellent in this easily missed coffee shop. The atmosphere was great and the barista was super friendly. I also tried a bite of a lemon scone, and it was quite tasty. My hope is that this place can grow and be open on the weekends. It would be a perfect coffee shop to walk to and enjoy morning. Also I think they need a little more sign-age. I almost completely missed  the door. Its a hidden gem."
0,"Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok, I know, cut the crap. It's just pizza.\n\nMy mom came to visit this weekend and we found ourselves at the door of Fuel - the neon sign beckoning us in - so we accepted the invitation. First impression: Truck stop? Where is the gasoline smell? I mean, if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck, that would draw in plenty of people!\nWe were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door, literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain, what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good, not to sweet, but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile.\nI'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord. That's a real pie."
1,It smells nice.\n\nIt's inexpensive.\n\nIt makes a sly dig at the recipient's personal hygiene.\n\nAnd this is yet another place where you can pick up gifts for any menopausal women who make it onto your Xmas gift-buying list.
0,"When the owner of the franchise has the customer service skills of an angry ape, it's no suprise fellow yelpers are down on this place. Purchased food through the drive through a while back and the order was filled incorrectly. So went back to the store, and after dealing with the manager just wanted a refund. He refused to provide a refund because he said we were rude. Ended up leaving food at the counter and walking out the store. Not worth the time, maybe Dickie's corporate will take it back."
1,"Not sure if they are worth 4 stars are not....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't omg delicious i want more..\n\na sunday, and we went around 1...line was crazy long, and I think we waited for 1.5 hrs.

1,"I've always liked Indian food, but it took this place to convince my wife how great it can be.  \n\nWe have eaten here three times at the restaurant and three times with takeout.  It's damn good.  My wife keeps it simple with the Tandoori Chicken Machkni.  I have had a bunch of different things and I will be using this place to educate myself about Indian food.  The Lamb Rogan Josh and the Andrea Curry are both awesome.  The service is always good.  It's a new place with an occasional hiccup, but they always work hard to fix the problems.\n\nIf I felt more qualified to rate Indian food I'd give this place five stars, but it's a solid four to be sure."
1,"What a refreshing experience to have a mechanic that cares!!\nWe have used highline many times \nThe price is always right and the service is top notch \nI would highly recommend anyone to get a second opinion here \nI had an AC replaced, brakes, many oil changes and a fuel pump replaced \nLike I said their prices are right and they completed the job fast, they even had a loaner vehicle for me to use for my convenience"
1,It's a Mall and it's a typical AE shop.  Service was great as I was greeted with a smile and asked by staff if I needed assistance.\n\nAlways great clothing and they had plenty in my size.
0,"Going back...The only way I was able to gain entry for my guests I had notified the hotel about, weeks in advance was to get another room. I just wanted everyone in, so I paid the cost. I was told I could have a limit of 5 people allowed in per room when I booked the second room. When my 9th person showed up, the pool manager tried to tell me he cant let anymore in as I am only allowed 4 per room. Their own employees do not even know their policies. Whether it was the front desk person that was wrong or the manager, somebody was relaying incorrect information to their guests. As I was pleading my case and remaining calm to the pool manager, he rationale was this...\""what happens if your party is taking up too many lounge chair or chaises and my paying guests have no where to sit? Or if someone in your party gets a little too rowdy or drinks too much? I then have to comp my paying guests a free dinner and $500 credit.\"" Verbatim. I looked around, it was about 2 pm and there were plenty of available chairs. I pointed him to my cabana that I, a paying guest paid for and showed him the majority of my party was couples sitting on the grass playing with newborn babies. A real tough crowd I tried to bring. He said he is \""just looking out for the benefits of his paying guests.\"" He went out of his way to keep using the term, \""paying guest.\"" What does that make me? The guy who was roped into buying an extra room, on top of a cabana, and had HUNDREDS of dollars worth of services scheduled at the spa for the next day. He finally relented and let my last two guests in, though the damage was done. I was on edge and stressed out from all the hoops they made me jump through just to have a few people over that I had cleared with my concierge weeks in advance. And it gets better... As I was checking out, the desk attendant asked me how my stay was and I told him the truth, that I wasnt pleased with the way I was treated and how I was put through a ringer to get a few guests into the pool that I had already gotten pre-approval for. I then asked to speak to the hotel manager and he said no problem. He comes out from the back and says the hotel manager is in a meeting but would be happy to call me later today. I gave him my number. That was at 10:30 am. It is now almost 9 pm and i never once got a call. The best part is we had a late flight and we stayed on the grounds and ate some lunch. My concierge gave me a $75 gift certificate that I was told could be used anywhere onsite. I tried to use it to pay for a $30 lunch. The waitress came back and said it had been cancelled and there was no money on it. I am a starwood preferred member, I have a starwood AMEX and I have stayed in only starwood properties for the majority of my adult life. I will do my best to never set foot on one of their properties ever again. If it wasnt for the friends they tried so hard to keep out of their pool area and my girlfriend whose birthday we were attempting to celebrate, the weekend would have been ruined. Luckily I choose my friends better than I choose hotels I stay at."
0,"I was very excited to finally get to try this Lo Lo's chicken and waffles only to be let down by the lack of seasoning in the chicken, the almost \""eggo\"" low quality of the waffles and the unbelievable amount of sugar in the red koolaid type drink. As I ate it I could almost feel myself getting fatter. When I got back to work I felt the after effects as my body began to crash like I was going into a coma. The three women I ate there with loved it though but they all were very used to this type of food having gone there weekly for some time. The three women I was with were also obese and not health conscious at all. The quantities were big but the taste and quality were not and I doubt I'll be back any time soon."
0,Worst Italian food ever. Rude waiter. Decore very lame. Room full because of coupon customers. I don't know where other reviewers have gone but don't listen to them! Stay away.
1,"Everytime I'm in Vegas, I make it a point to have one meal here. I have never been disappointed with either the food or the service."
1,"Three words: FISH FRY FRIDAY.\n\nHave you ever been to a backwoods bar in Wisconsin that has an all-you-can-eat fish fry on a Friday night for practically nothing?\n\nIf you answered \""no\"" to that question, then I invite you to experience the Peoria Cafe. It's the next best thing, right here in Arizona!  What you will get is reasonable prices, friendly service, and a good, old-fashioned Friday night fish fry.\n\nThe downside is that they only serve until 8 (?!?!) and I don't think they serve alcohol; everyone knows that a truly awesome fish fry is complimented by a brandy old-fashioned and/or a microbrew.  I would give a few points for their delicious home-made ranch dressing.\n\nMy advice: pre-drink and head over to the Peoria cafe for a great fried fish dinner!"
1,"Our out of town group headed to this Hooters to watch some football & relax after a day of meetings.  Our Hooters Girl was fresh out of training and served us all well.  The manager was very accommodating to us and made sure the football game was on the tv's nearest us so we all had a great view.  We had a new Hooters newbies with us, and I think they left impressed.\n\nThis Hooters is impressively large for a downtown location.  Plenty of seating including an outdoor patio."
0,"This place is awful, the portions are so small it's ridiculous paying almost $8 for rice, over-cooked vegetables and a tiny bit of bland chicken is a terrible rip off. The cashier was so rude; we couldn't hear what she was saying and when we asked questions, she scoffed like we were stupid for Even asking the question. The cook on the grill was clueless too. Don't spend your money here, it's a waste."
0,Horrible don't give a cr*p service. The worst I have experienced in any restaurant here in the valley! The manager Gary is an apathetic weasel with no customer service skills. Anyone want to buy a $25 gift card from this dump?
0,"Over priced for you get...don't believe the hype. Three people, 3 sandwiches and 2 fries, $45.00 at a walk-up. And if you have high-blood pressure avoid those fries.\n\nDisappointed local."
0,"OKAY. I really don't know if the previous reviews were done by close friends and relatives but I can tell you that I am very very disappointed by my experience at Sana restaurant. My first time was awful, second time my friend ordered some takeout. Chicken biryani was clearly reheated 10 times, dry tasteless. Chicken tikka masala, dry and the sauce is like someone poured water in it, for 9.99$!!! I'm usually not that negative but this restaurant is a BIG NO NO for me and anyone around me. You want a better restaurant, honestly? Salateen on jean-talon, yum or any other restaurant on jean-talon."
0,"If you want to be treated like garbage at a pretentious overpriced \""whatever\"" of a restaurant then go.  My recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here.  We were greeted rudely when they learned we did not have a reservation.... On a freaking Thursday.... In a college town!  We walked out, so thankfully they did not get our money and we had a wonderful meal just two doors away."
0,"Big Trouble in Little Szechuan would be too harsh a review  and  it's not worthy  of a great wail but  I was totally underwhelmed by the food on offer and food wise it seriously is   a step above the mall food court  but   even a Pei Way on a good day  is more than a match for this evening's meal. \n\nStaff are great but  everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.     The spring roll, egg, hot  and sour soup and  the  kung pao all look the part but  it's all monotonous  with little variation in texture and taste.  E.g you could  make this from  Walmart  ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost     It's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but  there's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit."
1,"I was pleasently suprised about this place. It's not what I was expecting at all if I'm honest.\n\nFirstly this place is new, really new - it still hasnt had a chance to loose its new restaurant shine, which is nice. It's certainly better than the old pizza hut which was here. But because its new, its often empty which is a little bit uncomfortable. Never the less, I'm sure as it gains a reputaion there will be more of the seats filled each night.\n\nAnyway, Illegal Jacks is like the illegitimate love child of Subway and Tex-mex food. You kind of shuffle along a counter while you choose your food and its made freshly in front of you. Then there is some food which is made in the kitchen and brought to you. It's a bit confusing and frankly seems uneconomical, but its different which is the main thing.\n\nThe food is good, I do like any type of tex-mex though, so see for yourself - its an experience more than anything!"
0,The wait is to long. Some staff are friendly.  Not a kids friendly urgent care. I waited about 3 hours. Its just funny that graveyard wait times are longer than if you come in the afternoon.
1,"As a shift worker, I am always on the look out for a good caffeine fix.  Likewise, I am obsessed with finding the best toddy in town.  With these in mind, I had to try Lux.  The vibe is definitely hipster but friendly and approachable--I hate to walk in and everyone turns to ask who the hell is this guy raiding our shop.  The toddy here was good, slight caramel notes and mildly bitter (in a good way).  I would grade this as the 2nd best toddy in the valley.\n\nOh, can't forget the patio.  Love it."
0,"I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar, espresso bar, gelato, sushi and udon stand, a GIANT cheese counter where you could sample...I could go on.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Whole Foods is small, and almost as overcrowded as its parking lot.  Two-thirds of the time they are out of what I came for.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying THAT much for groceries, I want a stellar shopping experience.  This WF is mediocre at best."
1,"I found the waitstaff a bit pushy, but the food was great.  Really a good deal for the amount and quality of food you get.  Love how you are able to choose from a selection of very unique tacos.  The three plate taco deal is the best.  I especially love the backyard BBQ taco.  I keep coming back to this place, although the margaritas could be a bit stronger!"
1,"what an amazing experience. Katie and the team at David's Bridal Collections completely made up for the crappy experience that i had at the Ahwahtukee location.\n\nthe day before had been disparaging. i had gone to DBs in Ahwahtukee and had the worst experience with an associate. by the end of the day i had pretty much resigned myself to not finding a dress that weekend and feeling sad that i wouldn't be able to pick out a dress with my mom. a friend had mentioned that maybe the location in Scottsdale would have more of the dresses i was looking for in stock so i decided to book an online appointment Saturday night for one at 11am the next morning. i am so glad i did!\n\nfirst of all, the location is amazing. its extremely clean, accommodating, and much more pleasant than the Ahwahtukee location. also the staff here seem to genuinely care about finding you the right dress for that special day. we were immediately greeted by friendly staff at the front desk and within 5 minutes of wandering around and picking out dresses, Katie met with me to start trying on dresses. \n\nin my previous review of the Ahwahtukee location i had mentioned that the associate there just threw me a corset and told me good luck! well here i was give a corset, a slip, and shoes so that i could get a more accurate picture of what the dress would look like the day of. SO MUCH BETTER. also Katie helped me in and out of every dress which was a huge time saver and waaayyyyyyyyyy easier than trying to wrestle with these monsters. she also clipped the dresses when they were too big and brought tons of cute accessories to complete the look. girl was full service and so much fun!\n\nkatie was outstanding. she brought dresses that i had personally picked out as well as some dresses she thought i may like based on the theme of the wedding and based on the answers to the many questions she asked about the day of. she actually asked questions! she was so sweet and easy to talk to. i wasn't uncomfortable with her at all and she also made my mom and friends feel welcome and part of the process. katie actually made this experience almost too wonderful because i immediately found 3 dresses i fell in love with but with her adding accessories and completing the look, i was able to find that one dress that would really make the day!!! Thank you, Katie!!\n\nwhile i realize that DB is a national chain, i really think the ladies at david's bridal collections in Scottsdale go the extra mile to make this an experience. the dressing rooms are large and well kept, the store is clean and all dresses are on display, and the staff is just wonderful. i couldn't ask for a better experience!"
1,"We have been to Jason's Deli in other cities and never really been impressed but this one impressed us! We had a quick light lunch on a Saturday while touring uptown Charlotte. From the minute we walked in, the staff was very friendly. We split a sandwich and they even put it on 2 plates for us. They reminded us of the complimentary muffins, crackers, pickles and ice cream and the panini sandwich was delicious!"
1,"Service at your seat!! =D Food and drinks!! Beer and wine!! What else could you ask for!! The VIP room's is the way to go, with the huge cushy leather couch, privacy and did I mention no inconsiderate patrons talking or eating in your ear!! Your next special occasion you got to give it a try! \n\nWe got a sneak peek on how they prepare their flavored popcorn, I could'nt believe it was made there! Too bad there is not one in Californina I guess I need to go back out to visit the theater and have the best movie experience EVER!"
0,"I would like to share my experience from last weekend's concert (3/16/13) at the Mirage (seats FF 7,8,9,10 I believe). While the show was phenomenal, our party of four was very disappointed, as our experience was ruined by loud hecklers sitting behind us. While I understand that rude audience members are not the fault of the venue, we felt the concert staff did not address or handle the situation properly. The party behind us yelled obscenities throughout the show, including \""Shut Up!\"" to the performers while they were singing on stage. During every song, rude, loud, and obnoxious comments were made. Others around us were annoyed too, giving the group behind us dirty looks. We could not hear the words being sung to a single song - even the slow ones!\n\nAt one point, a single staff member came by to give them a warning. However, after that, there was no follow-up by the staff, and it went on like this throughout the night. It seemed as if the staff was more interested in enjoying the show than attending to its guests. After the show, we immediately approached a Mirage staff member to voice our disappointment. The response we got was, \""it's a concert. It's supposed to be loud.\"" We then asked to speak to a manager. The manager told us there was nothing he could do, now that the show was over. He offered to have us come back for the same show again, but we were leaving that day and could not attend. The manager also conveniently did not have any business cards on him so that we could contact him. \n\nI am sorely disappointed in not only the lack of training of the Mirage concert staff, but also in the poor follow-up and conflict resolution by management."
0,"This review applies to the Durango / Warm Springs LV location.\n\nSo I had to pick up dinner for my family, most notably one of my kids who was having a late after school practice session. I ordered two pepperoni pizza's and when I picked them up, I asked if they could put three pieces in a separate small box for my kid. \n\nThe clerk, a teenager, looked a little clueless about this request, and went to ask her manager, which is understandable, as she doesn't have the power to make such a mind altering executive decision. The manager replied that they could not touch the pizza once it came out and that the answer was \""no.\"" So it's okay to touch it before it goes into the oven, but after that, no. Got it. \n\nShe then said \""my manager said I could give you bread stick bags.\"" I said \""you don't have a small box?\"" and she replied that the request was impossible. So she gives me these paper bags. I open the pizza box at the counter to start to separate the slices into these narrow bags for my kid, which is clearly not working. The pizza is piping hot, burning my hands, cheese is going everywhere and it's not even sliced right, so I'm having to pull the scalding pizza slice off with my fingers and then place it in a skinny paper bag. \n\nThe manager sees my frustration and says \""is everything okay.\"" and I say, \""Can I just have a small box to put these slices in? This really isn't working.\"" He replies that they don't have a small box. \n\n\""Anything? Something you put breadsticks in or something?\"" \n\n\""No.\""\n\nI then spot a small box out of the corner of my eye that has cinnamon shit in it or something. \n\n\""I just saw a small box. Can't you give me one of those?\""\n\n\""Uh, no. We track our boxes.\""\n\nWhat happens when one of the boxes falls on the floor? Or gets contaminated? How do you account for it then? It was clear that he just did not want to account for a missing box when clearly he could have. \n\n\""How much would it be to BUY a box,\"" thinking it would be fifty cents or something. \n\n\""Four dollars.\"" \n\nI shook my head and walked out. \n\nCustomer service should be your first priority, Little Caesars, especially with Yelp now. Pfffff."

0,"cheesecake factory sucks.  first off, get with the program, i'm a forum employee and you guys don't offer mall discounts.  2nd, why my to go order for SOUP took 39 minutes to get to me from the time i called is beyond my explanation, i know you guys didn't make this fresh i know it was sitting in a big vat with maybe just the garnishing put on right before it went out so why the delay?  3rd, why the fuck did my soup come in a coffee cup?  how in the fuck am i supposed to eat this without it getting everywhere?  and not even an apology from the incompetent to go clerk....like it's not abnormal for soup to take 39 minutes to get to a customer.  you guys are lucky i work in the same place and know how much it sucks to get aimlessly bitched at, so i wasn't gonna do that, but you guys suck.  fail in every aspect possible.  never again.  never.  only max brenner and fat tuesday's from now on.  rest assured, my whole staff feels the same way.  only reason we deal with you still is because your soup is only 5 bucks even with your non existent mall employee discount, but unfortunately now it takes 39 minutes to make it on our hour lunches.  never again..."
1,"have a drink with john the bartender before dinner.\n\nif you can't score a table then enjoy a fun dinner at the circular bar.\nthe bartender is some sparkly and beautiful girl who dangerously plys you with their signature espresso shots.  you'll often see jesse the stylish gm making the rounds.  \n\nthe garbage salad is popular with the ladies but who said i was one?\nheh heh.  so we opted for the sashimi n9ne.  big eye tuna, salmon and hamachi.  \n\nfollowed with the surf and turf - a filet mignon and lobster special with white truffle aioli and a red wine sauce.  we played \""healthy\"" and added in the grilled asparagus.  gotta have your veggies.\n\nand of course, save room for dessert since you'll be dancing it off at the club afterwards anyways.  i know we did!"

0,"Not the worst place to go in town, but certainly no where close to the best. The sushi here is just mediocre.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Nice atmosphere.\n\n2. Friendly staff.\n\nCons:\n\n1. No half rolls.\n\n2. The \""All You Can Eat\"" menu is limited during lunch hours; appetizers and many sushi rolls can only be added for half price. Most sushi restaurants include the appetizers and all rolls in their AYCE menu.\n \n3. Sushi here is definitely not as fresh and as good quality as other sushi places in town.\n\n4. Small booths, uncomfortable chairs.\n\n5. Very dark, we had to use the light from our cell phone to read the menu in the middle of the day during lunch time.\n\n6. Awful mix of music! Carole King \""So Far Away\"" followed by Backstreet Boys? WTF? It just kept getting worse...\n\nConclusion: When there are several other sushi restaurants in town with better quality, fresher ingredients, and a not so stingy AYCE menu, we won't bother coming back here unless we find out there have been some major changes."
0,"So here's the run down.  The place has good food.  Good sushi, good steaks, probably good appetizers.  But the service is not good.  1) Sushi came out really late.  2) When I spoke to the owner that was standing behind me about the sushi being late, he told me, \""talk to the sushi chef, not my problem\"".  So that got me pretty upset, but he kept talking.  He's extremely cocky and talks down at his customers.  So here's my suggestion:\n\nIf you want sushi, go to sushi-mon.  It's cheaper and just as good.\nIf you want good Japanese food, go to Raku.  It's also cheaper, and probably better.\n\nNow, if you're looking for an upscale-esque, \""cool\"" Japanese sushi place that serves to the \""cool\"" white-collar businessmen, with an overpriced menu that reminds you of a dining experience on the strip, while not being on the strip, then \""sen of Japan\"" is definitely for you.\n\nENJOY"
1,"I am not one to just give 5 stars to anyone but this place absolutely, positively deserves it! it was my first time visiting a Thai massage establishment and I am totally hooked after just one visit. Once you go into the back you really feel like you are on a mini vacation somewhere. So peaceful, quiet and relaxing. The whole experience was much more than i was expecting. The boyfriend and myself stopped in for some Thai foot massages and we left completely relaxed, happy and wanting to turn right back around for another session. Like I said, the experience was SO much more than what I was expecting..it was fantastic. I will be back Soon , for their Thai stretching/massage they offer. \n\nTotally affordable and totally awesome.\n\nYour feet do a lot for you EVERDAY... show them how much you appreciate all their hard work :)"
0,"Alright, by looking at my rating of this place you may just write this place off.  But I have to explain.  I have been here twice and both times we had the same waiter, older gentleman with a southern accent.  He is one of the best servers ever, very prompt, polite and earns his tip.\nBoth times we noticed the place was curiously empty of patrons. The second time we went there was a banner out front that read \""New Management\"", made me think it wasn't being ran well for awhile.\nNow to explain the rating.  Both times we order their sampler plate, it comes with tacos, chimmichanga's, and something else. Anyways the first time after eating there I came home and puked at about 2 AM (we had dinner there).  The second time the same thing happened, so I thought too much of a coincidence.  Sorry Garcia's waiter, but I won't be back."
1,"My husband and I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and every time we leave, we're glad we went.  They always have good, friendly service and good food.  I like the fact that they have a nice wine selection with unique choices you don't see at other places.  I hope it's around for a while and continues to remain high in quality and service."
0,"I wanted to love this place. I really, really did but really, really didn't love it. I didn't even like it that much. We took some friends there for lunch today and by the looks of the food, it seemed so promising. It is a casual spot where the food it pretty much pre-prepared and being heated in the windows at the counter. This restaurant has pizza, salads, pasta, sandwiches, and baked goods. I ordered one of the specials, chicken parmesan with a side of penne alla vodka. The chicken was so bland that I felt like I was eating boiled chicken. As my husband put it, it tasted like diet food but without the benefits of diet food because of the breading. The pasta was also weirdly bland and spicy. The spicy part really surprised me because I have never had it spicy. My husband had the penne alla campagna (1/2) and another (1/2) penne dish that we can't remember. His were slightly better than mine but not by much. It is sad that the best part of the meal was the pepperoni pizza we bought for kids. Would I go there again? Probably not. For 4 adults and 2 kids, we spent $65 which I find disappointing for an extremely mediocre meal. I suppose for people that work close by (it is downtown at Central and Adams), it is a nice convenience but if I wanted Italian food, I'd probably choose Pasta Bar."
1,"Come on girl! Work that muffin top off! \n\nAhhh how im becoming a lil gym junkie! I have the badge to prove it, haha! So I decided to check out this Y bc its open on Sunday AND they have a Zumba class at a good time! Now I for some reason thought the other on Meadows was closer, but this is a lil closer to my place. I also have to say I like this facility a lot. \n\nNow here they do not have an indoor pool, but the water park looks AMAZE BALLS! I cant wait for the summer! Now so far I have no gripes with this facility!\n\nWhat I really LOVE is the layout; its all on one level! Now imo the flow is better, I really like seeing everything on one floor. The childrens gym is better than the Meadows, but not as amazing as the one in Pueblo. Here they make you get a \""child card\"" before being able to drop your precious cargo off; they also require you to leave ID whilst your kids are there. Pretty cool imo bc now noone can say \""hey that lil one is mine!\"" Hehe. \nAs you veer to the left you have a.room with all your treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and an area to stretch. Here they again have wall mounted LCDs and a giant fan. The next huge room is were all your free weights and machines are. I love they have the rooms seperated! I for one do not like the fact that these hot mens can see my ass going all cray on the elliptical! Lol. The weight room is super great! I know this is weird but I LOVE how its painted green! Its like relaxing and motivates me! The room is also very well cooled and ventilated. \n\nThe studios are also pretty snazzy! Since this facility is all one floor they can have higher ceilings which then make you feel great working out! Not like in a box, at times I felt like that at Heinrich. The room is also convieniently located right across from the bathrooms and water fountains. Its also nice and cooled and not muggy.\n\nNow at the other Y I LOVE the Zumba teacher Christina, here so far ive worked with Ariel and some other Hispanic lady and have really enjoyed them! They both have the perfect amount of charisma and enthusiasm and remind us to stay hydrated! They also show diff levels, which is very caring of them. They are totally not snobs AT ALL and actually look like they care if youre enjoying yourself and make you wanna come back! I also like that they dont break your ear drums while they play the music!\n\nAnother good thing is that after 7pm its not busy! No wait and not a crap ton of people! Its nice, if you dont like working out with hella people this is your spot! They also have a worker walking around and readily available if you have questions! SCORE! Also included is towel service free!\n\nSo far I like this center a little better! Im still going to go to Heinrich mainly for Zumba with Christina and the fact they have a steam room!\n\nSo ladies and gents, get off your tookus and lets get healthy together!!!"
0,"Giligans is a bar that my friend's and I LOVE to go to when out in old town. The prices are a little steep for a \""dive\"" bar, however the atmosphere is always fun. My friends and I love to play the over-sized JENGA and Connect four. \n\nThis past Saturday, however, was horrible. We arrived and ordered drinks as usual. We started to play the connect four, and my friend cut his hand very badly on the connect 4 board. I asked a woman who was walking by for a band-aid, she appeared to be a manager. She said yes and kept walking. About ten minutes later his hand was still bleeding and she still had not brought it over. We walked to the bar and I asked a security guard if he could get us one. When he came out the woman followed and completely ignored us. I tapped her shoulder and asked if she had forgot about us. She immediately turned around and said \n\n\""I am too busy to be bothered with your little problems. Put your hands on me again and see what happens to you.\""\n\nI immediately reported this to the owner who was standing nearby and she apologized for what happened, but did not seem to really be shocked at all.\n\nThis is unacceptable behavior from anyone in any business. It was completely brushed under the rug by everyone who we spoke with and went unrecognized."
1,"Stayed here for the first time after 20 straight years staying downtown mostly at the Plaza and Nugget.  What a terrific hotel, casino and atmosphere.  They are doing everything right here - including offering clean, simple and comfortable rooms, top quality service, excellent dining options and great location.  We will stay at the Downtown Grand from now on - and the casino host (Marnelli) was the most professional and friendly person with whom our group has dealt.  Thanks Grand!"
1,"All I can say is WOW!\n\nI have a membership to 24 Hour Fitness.... and after a 1-week introductory membership to Barre.... I'm hooked.  I'll keep my 24HF membership (just cuz), but I now have purchased classes at Barre too to mix up my workout routine.\n\nTheir classes are fun and intense.  It's like working out with a trainer without paying the price of a trainer. Their Mixed Barre class works the whole body.... of course, it is all about a strong core, concentrating on specific areas for specific movements.  I've only been to 3 Mixed Barre classes and so far each of them has been different which is really great. I've been to 1 Cardio Yoga class and it's a fantastic class.  It's Yoga with some cardio mixed in.  It's hard to explain, but you work up a nice sweat and get the heart rate going so ... it works.  :)  \n\nUnlike going to the gym (which I see as a chore), I actually look forward to the Barre classes.  :)\n\nYes, I hurt from all the leg, butt and shoulder moves.... but it's a \""good\"" hurt... meaning.... muscles hurt that I didn't even know were muscles.  (Probably because they are weak-ass muscles, but I know after more Barre classes.... I won't be so sore.)\n\nI recommend at least trying 1 class.  It is not for everybody... but it does seem like quite a few people that try it... like it.  And the instructors are really fabulous!"
0,After coming back 3 more times and each time the quality of food had gone down I have to remove 2 stars.
1,"Brio, Brio, Brio.  The location, outdoor space, and aesthetic is great.  There is complimentary valet and they were very quick to return my car upon exiting.  The food was pretty good.  I had some Mahi Mahi that was on special enjoyed it, but was not blown away.  I don't recall much about the service, but I think that is a good thing.  Given the upscale environs the price is also good.  You can get away with salad, dinner, and drink for about $30.  The beer selection is minimal, only national brands.  Good spot, sit outside."
0,"I use RD quite often, but it is enter at your own risk. There isn't any sign of management or organization. It is a free for all with other customers, and beware when you queue up to make purchase. Long lines, slow service and dysfunction with employees. The Chefs Store is more accommodating with better customer service, but not as convenient a location."
1,"Where the super-hip chill  and pontificate on the finer points of blunt rolling.\n\nAside from being Super-Hip, they are Ultra-Cool;  Like 2 lame superhero characters, the are sexy as hell, fun to be around and you never know what the hell is really going on, but you know you are digging it.\n\ndrinks are exotic, erotic and whet my tongue.  Or was it that the sexy bartender chic?"
0,"I took my Mazda here for the service department to diagnose a clunking noise I had been hearing for a few days. I do my own car work, so they knew that they wouldn't be repairing my car.\n\nThe service associate (didn't catch his name) didn't even take my car over a speed bump like I specifically asked. He just opened the hood and looked around for about 3 minutes, and then told me that 'nothing appeared wrong, but would have to hook up a computer to it to find the problem and that would cost me $125.' I asked a second time for him to take it over a speed bump, and he said it 'doesn't make sense to do that.'\n\nI left and went down the street to Martin's Auto Repair on 16th St and Indian School. The mechanic had me drive him over on speed bump, he heard the noise, and immediately had an idea of what was wrong. He lifted my car when we got back to the shop, and found a loose bolt on my front passenger strut. All that required was a tightening.\n\nI'm appalled that Mazda tried to charge me $125 to use a computer that wouldn't have found the problem in the first place. I guess because he knew the dealership wouldn't get my money from the repair, so he had to get every penny he could out of the diagnosis. \n\nHere's some advice for Mazda: Listen to your customers. They might not know every little thing about cars, but they deserve to be taken seriously and not brushed off like I was."
0,"As a vegetarian, I was really excited to try this place out, but unfortunately had a really bad experience.\n\nCame in the other night around 8:30pm, wasn't busy at all, we were sat and waited almost 20 minutes before we were even greeted at the table, after we ordered we waited another 30 minutes for the food to come, our pad Thai was cold, and they forgot our other plate, and when it finally came it was burnt. And that still would've been okay but our server was unapologetic and didn't seem to care.\n\nI work as a server as well and know things can get busy and mistakes can happen and I am sympathetic with that. But the overall service was bad, slow, and the food was disappointing."
0,"Is everyone on yelp crazy? Of course not, but I have a feeling this place has a bit of a loaded rating. \n  \n  First off, its in the back of an office park, terrible location unless you work there and zilch for ambiance.  \n \n  Second, the staff is beyond stoned. I'm sorry, but I burned one on the way here and you are all much higher than I am. \n \n  Third, 30 min for one measly sandwich at 1:30 in the afternoon, come on.\n\n  Fourth, the sandwich sucked. The bread was good. That's it. I got the prosciutto sandwich and there was one measly little slice of meat. Seriously? This took 30 min? Similar reactions from those seated around me. \n  \nThis is not a place to go if you are hungry or in a hurry, stick to Jason's Deli."
1,I had the Boston Clam Chowder soup in a bread bowl and it was fabulous! The corned beef sandwich was not amazing but the soup made up for it.
0,"I was so hyped up to try this restaurant! Just went last to Las Vegas for the very first time ever to celebrate my birthday. And the last day there which was last sunday. I wanted to try out Bartolotta Ristorante Di Mare. I did some research about the best restaurants in vegas to try and they always came up and then when i saw the pictures I thought it was beautiful. And the prices looked reasonable so I thought this is a good choice. But then when we get there, it was so odd. NO ONE WAS THERE. I mean the only people that looked like was a waiter & the greeter person that escorts you to your seat. Other than that, there were NO CUSTOMERS whatsoever. Something about that seemed so strange to me. I almost thought they were closed at first. Thats how vacant it was. And the two workers that were in there, were looking at us so desperately like they wanted us to come in so badly so they'd get some business. But we left, because something about a vacant restaurant in the middle of the day it was around 4pm in the afternoon. Something about that seemed strange. To make a long story short, we left and ended up eating at Tao at the Venetian. And they were delicious and had customers. Whats going on with you Bartolotta? Why no customers in the middle of the day?"
1,We didn't have reservation so ate at the bar with business partner on a Friday night. Reservations are needed for tables. Bar is set up for dinner service with plenty of room. Very good dinner and house wine from owner's vineyard in Portugal. I had Caldo Verde (Portuguese soup) and Codfish in tomatoes. Both were great. Priced similar to other downtown Montreal resturants.\n\nThey also own Cafe Vasco de Gama a few doors up on Peel. Another great breakfast/lunch/coffee stop. I will go back to both Ferreira and Vasco de Gama.
1,"Good BBQ, Service was great and atmosphere was wonderful! I wasn't impressed with the cole slaw that a lot of reviews raved about... But the little donuts they give you when you leave were yummy! Kind of has a weird entrance, but over all we enjoyed our date night here."
1,"Great collection from Wynn and you get to hear Wynn's voice explaining each art piece.  \n\nI remember the diamond art piece (yes, an art piece made out of diamonds). \n\nIt's made my Vegas vacation more memorable than the usual gambling / clubs/ buffets."
0,"Since we live close, we were anxiously waiting for something to open back up in the old Smokehouse BBQ place after 15 North closed.\n\nMaverick Rock Taco was a disappointment.  It is very pricey for what you get and just not that good.  Basically they have several options for fillings and you can get them in a taco ($3), burrito ($9), salad or entree (varies but in the teens)\n\nWe started with chips and salsa with a trio of sauces ($9).  The salsas were completely lacking in spice, including the mango habernero.  The tomatillo wasn't bad tasting but just a little bland.  The chips were interesting--more flour tortillas than corn with sea salt.  Not too bad but for $9?\n\nThe tacos were pricey, small and not that good.  The shrimp tacos were very good but all the others we sampled were dry overcooked and bland.\n\nThe burritos were the same as the tacos only filled with rice to take up the space in the larger tortilla--definitely not the way to go.\n\nThe margaritas were good ($10).  The service was not bad at all--as far as the regular service.  It took a very long time to get drinks, though and the bar was not that full when we were there.\n\nThe place was very loud and it was tough to carry on a conversation.  It would probably be a good place for kids as they could run around screaming and nobody would notice over the sound system.\n\nBasically, I can make everything on their menu better and cheaper and if I am short on time, I will stick with Roasting Company's soft tacos or even the Taco Bell down the street in the future."
1,"Props to Todd E.  This place is much better executed than his other concepts I've eaten at.  Busy, very popular.  Ridiculously high prices for an excellent beer selection. Lobster roll delicious but dripping in butter and sauce."
0,People who work there are full of attitude.\n\nFood is tasteless\n\nIce tea has no flavor\n\nNo point to the place
1,"Wow, this was without a doubt one of my best dining experiences!  If you are looking for modern, sleek, yet warm and cozy place this is it.  Service from our waiter Doug D was top notch.  Now for the best part, our food.  We enjoyed a sampling of items and have to say that everything was amazing however there were some highlights: \n\nCucumber martini, clean crisp and refreshing!  \n\nPOLIPO (Char Grilled Octopus, \""Livornese\"" with Toasted Bread Crumbs and Oregano).\n\nARANCINE (Braised Kobe Beef Risotto Cake Pomodoro, Parmigiano Crema).\n\nAGNOLOTTI (Piemonte Ravioli, Ricotta, Spinach, Crushed Pomodori Pelati).\n\nBRASATO (\""Piemontese\"" Braised Beef Short Rib,Potato, Caramelized Root Vegetables ).\n\nDon't forget the deserts.  We tried five of them and our table favorite was the CROCHETTE (crispy amaretti doughnuts with spiced glaze, chocolate ganache, apple butter,fontodi, vin santo del chianti classico)."
1,Huge fan of this place. I go there every couple of months. Amazing food!
1,Being a Mexican food lover i must say that Tacos y Tortas El Panzon has given me to opportunity to try some of the most delicious and authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I was very impressed by their salsas and the quality of their customer service. I will definitely recommend their food and i must say they have the BEST tacos in ALL Las Vegas!
0,"I'm going to start off by saying that every Pita Jungle review I will do will be based on how high the Tempe location set the bar. It is the ONLY Pita Jungle I will return to. They're the only location with consistently good flavors, portions and service. \n\nI waited almost a year to eat here after this location opened, because I learned my lesson after going to the location in Scottsdale on it's opening weekend. That experience was horrible. Because of that experience, I like to give a place a while to work out the kinks before I visit. If you want more info, check out that review.\n\nSo this location. Okay. Well, It's usually dead in there if you go anytime after 7pm on a weekday. Mostly because it's downtown and it dies down here after everyone gets out of work. I live in the area and this location always looks really busy at lunch time, so I opted to go in for dinner, twice.\n\nVisit #1- I went in with a friend and we shared a plate of hummus and pita for an appetizer. Meh. It was okay. The hummus tasted like it was old or something. And the pita was cold and almost hard. Usually any place will warm up the pita for you (which I know to be true of other PJ locations), but they did not. We asked our waiter to warm up our plate of pita because ours was cold, and he kind of huffed about it and reluctantly went and got us another plate. So then out came our entrees. I got the Caribbean salad, and my friend got the Broiled Fish Sandwich. For those of you who don't know, the Caribbean salad is pretty much just a big fancy fruit salad on top of mixed greens with coconut and raisins. Well, that's what it's supposed to be. Mine was just mostly a bunch of grapefruit on top of iceberg lettuce. The apples looked to have been cut long before they were put on top of my salad because they were turning brown from being exposed to air, the bananas were also turning brown and didn't taste fresh at all. I kind of picked at my food, but I don't even think I ate 1/3 of it. Waste of food and money. My friend seemed to enjoy her sandwich but she added that it tasted really fishy. I know, I know. It's a fish sandwich. But anyone who knows anything about seafood knows that fish shouldn't be FISHY. Whatever. I tried. Round 1 at this place wasn't a total disappointment, but I wasn't planning on rushing back in any time soon.\n\nVisit #2- I went in late one night to place a to-go order after I had gotten out of school. I was REALLY hungry, as I didn't have time to eat before going into my 6pm class. I got out of school around 9, headed home and looked for a place to eat. Unless you want fast food, your choices are slim when you're downtown at night. I headed inside, the place was almost deserted. There was 1 couple sitting close to the front door, about 3 or 4 wait staff that I could see and that was it. I went up to the counter and ordered a greek salad and a side of pita and hummus. The girl who took my order was very sweet but a couple of the other employees (including one of the cooks) were just staring at me angrily. I guess it offended them that I would walk in and order something so close to the time they closed. Anyway, a couple (literally) mins went by and my food was ready to go. The nice girl who rang me up wished me a good night and was very polite to me. I got home, so excited to sit down and eat my salad. I opened the box and everything just looked thrown in there. I know I got it to go and all, but where's the presentation? It literally looked THROWN into the box. Whatever, I'm gonna eat it anyway. I took a few bites of my salad and then opened the hummus up. Guess what? THE PITA WAS COLD. AGAIN! I live a total of 2 driving mins away from this place there is no way it was heated up and got cold by the time I got there. Ugh. Just ugh. \nMaybe I'm being too picky, I mean this isn't really authentic mediterranean or ANY kind of food I guess, but I just wish people would try a little harder to keep people coming back. I realize this place gets most of their business from the downtown business crowd, but where's your sense of neighborly love? \n\nIt's been about a year since my last experience there. Maybe I'll go back, but only if I'm being taken there by someone else and they're paying for my food. I'm done giving this location my money. The Tempe location is better, and they're really only about a 15 min drive from downtown."
0,"Excellent aged steaks 5 stars, good service, wine selection pretty lame unless you want to spend hundreds and hundreds. BUT the crab salad was the cheapest POS salad ever, minus 5.  I stopped at one point and asked myself if it was some cheep caned watery tuna, about two tablespoons for $30.. If this place is in the top ten restaurants in Vegas as advertised, they should shut the town down and quit. Pitiful just pitiful, and the side of asparagus was much better.  If you want a complete dinner, skip this joint!"
0,"If you really like Denny's you'll love this. Just not for me, I didn't find anything special here.."
0,This place blows. Foods ok but service is terribly slow. Maybe I have just caught them on off days but I will go to Big Heng down the street from now on.
1,I've only been to this eatery once but I want to go back as soon as I can.  I love Seafood and especially places that have an all you can eat policy; (Ive gained almost 30lbs in the past year and a half since moving to Vegas) but this only qualifies for an average local eatery spot. so this is your typical local eatery you have to wonder why is it so popular:?\n\nThe answer is that on Monday it is all you can eat Crab Legs; I heard about that and took a day off of work to get there at 4:30 (Restaurant opens at 5) When I arrived I was 15th in line so keep that in mind get here early for the best tables and to ensure you get your fair share of good/great crab legs. \n\nAnother thing I had while there was a jalapeno Hush Puppy. OMG if you like a little spice you must give them a try. They were free when I was there as they are hoping you fill up on them rather than the crab legs.  They bring out the regular Hushpuppies when you sit down so you will need to ask specifically for the jalapeno ones; \n\nBe careful in the parking lot; I drove right over the curb and did some serious damage to my vehicle.  As upset as I am about that I still give this place 4 stars so you know I'm serious when I tell you that you will not be disappointed with the food or their wonderful wait staff;
0,Oops this review was for Peoria location. Delete
1,"One of the best sandwich shops in town.  Going here for a week day lunch during rush hour I was lucky if there were less than 4 people ahead of me - in one of the 3-4 lines running at the same time.  Yet every time the lines went fast, the service was amazing and the food was great.  After 25 years in business, it's no wonder they have it down.  \n\nI was a huge fan of their chicken salad.  And their cookies.  Mmmm...  The place is huge so it's a great place to actually go for lunch - though with their phone in orders, it's awesome that they give a \""drive up\"" window too.  When I worked in the area we did lots of catering from there too and it was always a hit.  Especially the cookies.  At least, the cookies were a hit with me. \n\nIf you haven't been before, you've got to give it a try.  They are only open M-F from 10-4, so it's a small window - but a great break from the norm."
0,"I will never return to The Vintage again.\n\nThe service was decent given the fact that it was a busy Friday night when I went. However, the drinks I had there were awful.\n\nI spent $13 trying to get a decent drink and none of them did anything for me. Their Bloody Mary's are like drinking straight V8 and tobacco, their margaritas taste like licking cement, and the martini I had tasted like cough syrup.\n\nThe atmosphere of the joint is nice, but it's not enough to ever keep me coming back."
0,"Stopped by First Friday at the beginning of this month. 1 star is for the nice bartender in the back outdoors who had an extremely limited bar, but was friendly and nice. Granted it was a really busy night and it was one of the few places that weren't charging people to get in. (Seriously DTLV?) \n\nMy boyfriend and I sat ourselves at the largest table available in the main room, yeah it was only 2 of us at the time of seating, but we were waiting for 2 others to join us. We sat around for 10 minutes, while all the waitresses ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know if their manager doesn't know how to properly assign sections (with them running in and out of the room to the back, but it seemed like they could barely handle the large volume of people). We waited and waited, made eye contact with several people and still no service. I urged my boyfriend to go up to one of them at a computer putting an order in, and she proceeds to tell him that she's \""cut.\"" First of all, I'm a server at a high volume restaurant on the strip and I completely understand how annoying it can be when you're super busy and the last thing you want is to add another thing to do to your list of many, but how hard is it to tell a customer, \""let me find a waitress/server who can help you.\"" ??? Not that f*ing difficult. \n\nI was pissed and got up myself, looked for someone who would be standing around doing NOTHING (usually managers) sure enough I saw a gentleman standing behind the bar just people watching and walked directly to him and asked him if there were any servers serving the tables in the area because we had yet to be acknowledged. He pretended to act surprised as if he himself didn't see us either, and pointed at the girl... where else, AT THE COMPUTER. Hmmm, really?? All I wanted was to order drinks, shots and a side of french fries. EASY! I'm not a tough customer especially when I can tell people are overwhelmed. She drops our shots off (chocolate cake) no lemons and no sugar. I'm not a bartender, but I'm sure everyone knows they come with both. We ask her for both, walks away. Comes back with a few lemons in a cup and 2 packets of sugar and tosses them on the table and walks away. LITERALLY WALKED AWAY. No, \""is there anything else i can get you?\"" no nothing. I was so pissed. I assured my boyfriend and our guests that she wouldn't return until one of our cups were empty or all of them, and I was right. We got our ticket, left no tip and thats exactly what she deserved. I never leave bad tips, but wow service was an embarassment.\n\nSuch a nice place to go if you want to just look around and enjoy the decor, go straight to the bar yourself or else you'll be getting crappy service. Park on Fremont, really need to reconsider the type of people their hiring. Yeah they're pretty and attract a bunch of drunk, high paying customers. But if you can't deliver decent service, then whats the point??? ALL IN ALL, I'd rather pay 10-20 to get into commonwealth or any other bar downtown than to go back to park on fremont. What a shame, so much potential."
0,"Admittedly I have a bit of a weak-stomach especially when it comes to my olfactory sensory system. I honestly had a hard time visiting this grocery store and as embarrassing as it is to admit, I  actually had to jump ship at the end. \n\nThat being said, they have  fabulous aloe juice ranging from $1.99-2.99 for a large bottle ( $2.99 is the price for a small bottle at Common Mkt/Trader Joe's). They have everything you could possibly need or want for Asian cooking. My boyfriend marveled at the cost of the shrimp (much cheaper than HT). I had the hardest time with the meat dept because of the scent combined with looking at pig intestine started to make me gag a bit...but if you aren't a big baby like me check it out!"
0,"Parking is a bitch just because the signs are dated..there's a part of the casino that is just trekkied out...the vibe is middle aged people trying too hard to feel young again...the room is whatever..small ass twin beds..tiny ass shower.. Lol i'd say the perk of this hotel is the price and plasma tv..but when you're in Vegas are you seriously gonna watch tv? Also, there are mirrors everywhere ...weird? I shall review the free buffet tomorrow.... But yeah don't stay here because it's far as hell off las Vegas blvd and the room is tiny ;[ --that was the first 2 hours of my stay...now it's my third HOUR there and already I'm getting the rudest service of my life! I booked this room through a site where they said they would give us free stuff yet they can't honor it...and they're going to give me shit for it. To add to the rudeness,  one of the clerks walked away from me in the middle of a freaking question. What a bitch. I was told the manager won't be in until 6am. It is now currently 3:3am on yelp because that's how crappy this hotel is!!!\n\n\nThe only PRO about this was the people who were working the morning shift. Too bad the coupons didn't even WORK when we were there.  However, Hilton sent me a survey and I filled out.. They apologized and said next time we stay there, I will get a FREE upgrade.. Thanks but not thanks! Stay the hell away this place sucks."
0,"Flashback around 10 years ago. My first trip to Vegas. Imagine the amazement of this place and what was going to await me when I get to the Strip. Amazed at how the airport looked with the flashing lights and marquees and the slot machines going off. \n\nFlashforward to now after a few more trips and to this week, my latest trip there. The place needs a new overhall. They spent a shitload of money on the new City Center in Vegas on the strip but they can't seem to spend money on the airport, which looks the same and still has the same everything that this place had when I first started going to Vegas. Seriously, change things up a little. Make it more pleasing to the eyes. Hell, a new paint job would do wonders! Not really asking for an SFO type overhall. Just update the place a little. Please?"
0,Serious Customer Service needs to be implemented!! Please PT's Management get in here and make some needed changes . One word that describes the bartenders  laxidasical. I want this place to work I live right down the street. Great entertainment last night with Chris Heers. Which is the only reason  I tried it again. So disappointed in the service from the bartenders...Just a suggestion teacher your bartenders how to smile and greet the guest. I'm giving one star for the cold beer.
0,"I've been here a few times and we went for dinner tonight and the food was ok, but the service was beyond bad for a medium-end steakhouse.  The waiter took 10 minutes to even come over, didn't explain the menu or that the dinner includes a salad and we asked for caesar and uncharged us $9 without even explaining it.  The food took forever and the waiter barely checked on us.  After I asked for a check he went to check on 3 other tables and took 10 minutes to get our bill.  I wouldn't go back!!!"
0,Complete lack of respect for peoples time. Dirty office and a staff that has even less respect for their patients! Don't waste your time waiting here you'll spend less time waiting and get better care in an er!. I have been waiting 1hr and 30 mins past my 2nd appointment. Dr didn't even know why I was there!
0,"Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.\n\nYou need a fabulous space.\n\nFabulous people.\n\nFabulous prices.\n\nAnd lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.\n\nTao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.\n\nSo overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.\n\nThere were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. \n\nWith no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.\n\nIf you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. \n\nBut if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.\n\nTrust.."
1,"Used these guys again for my second move in a year.  My mother also used them for her move in the summertime.  Every time we use them we get great service and friendly yet respectful and professional movers.  I requested Kevin and Karl, only to find that Karl went into the family business with his brother (later to find out I use their business as well, Paradise Carpet Cleaners).  Kevin was the crew lead for my 2nd move and it was so nice to have him there.  The other two movers I had were great as well.  I'm sorry I don't remember their names.  Justin, you run a great business.  The cost was reasonable and the entire experience was much less stressful than it could have been because your guys handled it so well.  Again.  Thanks guys!"
0,"I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund. I have lived in rough places but this was by far worse than living in the projects. Please think twice about renting from this place save yourself some headaches and look elsewhere."
1,"Santa Margarita for 17 bucks!! Really can't beat that considering it's close to 30 in the grocery stores and at target. Plus they have a huge variety of beers, which is awesome for my hubby who is a beer lover. The sales associates are friendly and helpful. They often recommend cheaper wines similar to the pricey ones I've have grown to love. I've had a lot of luck with many of their recommendations."
1,"EVERYTHING at the Jean Philippe Patisserie always looks amazing. I don't know how they do it, but each and every treat looks like a work of art. \n\nI love the tiramisu gelato - it's amazing in a white chocolate waffle cone. And don't even get me started on the cheesecakes, fruit tarts, etc. They look almost too pretty to eat! (But you will eat them, because they're absolutely delicious.)"
1,"We didn't actually go into the restaurant, rather we strolled into the lounge on a lowkey Sunday nite just to see what the hype was all about.\nThe decor was GORGEOUS.  I want my house to look like the inside of this place!\nMy drink was fantastic.  My friend ordered a tall greyhound and the waitress was nice enough to ask \""double tall or tall w/ more grapefruit juice?\""  No one has ever asked that before, so we gave her a big tip.\nThe downside was that our drinks cost a lot of $$, however, the place itself and the friendly waitstaff made it that much better.\nWe would definitely go again when/if we come back into town."
0,"I called in advance to make sure they had time for me.  It was probably 5 and I said I'd be there by 6.  Great, get there at 6 and they start working on my pedicure.  The pedicure was great!! No complaints.  But then, I get the pink and white fill-in...and I've had some bad ones, but this one was horrific.  I specifically asked not to have the white so thick because I hate the chunky white look.  The tech simply dismissed my request and said that it's \""better\"" because next time I come in she just does the pink fill in and that it would save me money.  I don't give a flip about the money.  I'm very particular about my nails and THAT'S WHAT I WANTED.  I was annoyed but said whatever, they were closing soon.  I could tell she was rushing and the it was evident in the aftermath.  My nails looked like total (*#PU(*@#&$P*(# garbage.  There was acrylic all over my cuticles, bubbles in the gel.  Just a hot mess.  I will never go back here again. EVER.  If there were negative stars, trust me.  They'd be in the negative."
0,Horrible. Dirty. Unfriendly valet and front desk people. Go anywhere else. Waste of money.
1,"La place est bien. Le service est un peu lent et du Whitney Houston en ambiance est diff\u00e9rent comme choix de musique...\n\nPour le positif, la poutine G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Tao est excellente et tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse. La poutine r\u00e9guli\u00e8re est bonne aussi mais un peu sucr\u00e9e."
0,"There is no justification in the service I received. I went to meet a couple of friends the Friday before last. They happen to run into a friend of theirs. That gentlemen ordered some shots, drinks and dinner. I heard him tell the bartender it was on his boss's tab. A while later they tried to get him to pay his tab. He said \""I told you it was on my boss's tab\"" Long story short, his boss had left and they never put it on his tab. Some time goes by, the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman I was sitting with. He asked if we knew this other man. The gentleman I was with says he knew him a little, I stated I've never met him before. The manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab. (I personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional) We did not come here with this man, it is not our responsibility). I've bartended in Scottsdale and Vegas. It is the server/bartenders responsibility \nto get the credit card when starting a tab. After all, they did make sure to get mine. The manager stated it was just 1 drink ('what's the big deal'?) I clarified with him that it was just one drink? Again he stated yes. I didn't want to deal with trying to get some man I don't know to pay his tab and I didn't enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense, so I said \""If it's just one drink, put it on my tab\"" (which I shouldn't have to do). The manager shook my hand and said thank you.\n\n30 min later I closed out my tab. Keep in mind all I had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink. My tab was $62.00!!! The bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine. I called her over and I told her I found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful. She stated I said I would pay for the whole thing. I stated that was incorrect, she continued to argue with me. Why are we arguing? This is not my friend nor my tab. There is NOTHING to argue about. \n\nShe finally went to speak to the manager. After about 10 minutes, she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00. She never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his. I understand I said I would pay for this mans drink, but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab they'll have to eat. Every bar has a spill/comp tab. They shouldn't make anybody else responsible for this...On top of the unprofessionalism, arguing, lack of apology, and wait time to get this solved. As a person who runs a business myself, if my employees neglect to follow protocol (ie; neglect to obtain credit card in this case,)\nI eat the cost. I most certainly wouldn't have another paying customer cover it.\n\nTo make matters worse, myself and a friend (who frequents this establishment) went in to talk to a manager about this incident. I gave the MOD my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone. It has been 10 days. I never yelp about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... They lack professionalism big time in this place."
0,"This place is ok. I dont think its as good as everyone says it is. Its Americanized Mexican, which is fine but not something that I go for all the time and its definitely not at the top of my suggestion list for Mexican food restaurants."
1,"We've been back and it's still the best buffet around!  The lamb chops were absolutely divine, my favorite item!  Too bad it's so darn expensive!"
0,"I had such high hopes. I wanted a celebration of vegetables, in all of their glory! But all we got was fake-meat-product and oddly pie-eyed cultiness....\n\nWe have been driving by \""Loving Hut\"" since we moved into the area, and since I was once vegan and am more more of a vegetarian, I have been hopelessly seeking some good veggie options for eating out. \n\nUnfortunately, this was not it. \n\nFirst off, I am sure that I am not the first person to say this, but,fake meat product, in any form, is gross. It might look meat-like, but it is not meat-like in the taste department. I have never met anyone that was swayed into not eating meat by the introduction of meat-imitation. Just sayin'. \n\nSpeaking of being swayed: I felt like \""Loving Hut\"" is a little cultish. There were video monitors with a show or channel called \""Master\"" somethingrather and the two women talking on it were also in pictures and books all around the restaurant. Us non-meat-eaters already get a bad rap for being culty and pushy when we talk about our dietary choices (which, duh, you should be abiding by too) and I felt like that vibe was totally perpetuated in this place. \n\nAs far as the food goes, it was, eh, ok. OK at best, mind you. I think that had there been NO fake meats in just about everything on the menu it would have been a different story... Maybe. \n\nWe were served little soups before our meal which were tasty (but I had ordered the Pho, so I was like on soup-overload by the end of it all), the broth was yumtown. We also got some spring rolls which were non traditional, but pretty good. Same veggies as were in the mini soup, for a veggie place I exprected more variety I guess. My  husband got tons of fake meat product (one was fried and it tasted like fried, so duh it was good). \n\nIt was pretty in there, too. But the cultishness eeked the decor up to creep level 9, by the time we left. \n\nSummize to say, I am still in search of a veggie friendly restaurant,"
0,"they advertise hand made noodles but they need to advertise it more. the place was a little dirty to be honest and caesars mgmt needs to devote more attention to this place. the decor is cool as hell but the menu and execution sucks. they have the tools to do a lot more with the place but may be relying on the decor to do all the work.\n\ni also asked for 2 desserts, one after the other was not available, and both were not available. \n\nif you go to a buffet you can probably find most of the stuff and in better quality\n\nJEANS: OK by far\nORDER: waitress"
1,"I thought the food was great. I had the grilled yellowfin tuna, which was extremely flavorful, albeit slightly too grilled than I would have liked. The edamame appetizer was really really tasty. My friends had the miso-glazed chilean sea bass, lo mein, soy ginger salmon and a few sushi rolls. Overall, everyone was pretty happy with their dishes. I'm definitely satisfied with the portions...was happy to see they didn't serve bite-sized pieces on expansive white plates....the portions were large enough to fill.\n\nThe waiter was snooty, but he kept our water glasses filled. The restaurant is  also really loud. I sat at a table for 7, and I could barely hear the person talking one seat away from me.\n\nI'd probably go back for dinner next time I'm in Vegas."
1,"The salon has recently come under new management, and all I can say is how great it has become! I booked a 50-minute Swedish/Deep Tissue Massage last week and it was one of the best I have ever received. The atmosphere in the massage room is so quiet and peaceful it's like you're in a completely different place! The therapist found knots I never even knew I had and got me to relax more than I have been able to in a long time.  I also have frequent headaches that no amount of Advil can help with and within the first ten minutes of the massage, he had my headache gone! I will definitely keep coming back for massages at Kharizma Salon and Day Spa! :)"
0,"Okay, so this is the second year I've gone to Foodie Fest.  Last year we went on a Friday night, this year on Saturday at 6:30.  The line to get it wasn't bad when we arrived, but our friends came 15 min. later and the line was down the street and around the corner. I'll mention the entrance fee in a min.\n\nThe variety of food trucks appeared extensive, however by 6:30 over half were closing up shop and White Castle - oh White Castle...this is the main reason the huz and I decided to go.  A sign greeted us at the entrance that stated they would no longer be serving.  We went in anyway, saw that they were still cooking and people were sitting around - we soon realized that was the 4 HOUR wait - they gave people chairs!  We decided to grab a beer, however almost all was gone, our choices were Miller Light, wine or water!  It seemed so pointless, so I called my friends who were still standing in line and told them not to waste money getting in and we met up for dinner elsewhere.  \n\nWhat's appalling to me is the fact that when we left around 7:00, the line was unbelievable and any food trucks still serving had lines and wait times I had no patience for.  I wanted to have a megaphone and let the people waiting in line know that it was a waste, but I refrained.  I can't believe they continued to accept people's money ($10 at that - $8 for military) without letting them know what to expect.  All I kept saying is that I felt ripped off $28 down the drain in 30 min. or less and we were still hungry!  \n\nThe event, in my opinion, was poorly run, poorly organized and the staff seemed a bit clueless (texting, calling & not paying attention).  I feel sorry for the folks who continued to wait in line. I doubt we will return to this event, I'd rather continue our trips down to First Friday (Downtown) and Vegas StrEATs (at El Cortez). MUCH better and most of the trucks are at these locations anyway.  \n\nBoo."
0,"OK, I've only been once. The GF and I were in search of a happy hour in the area.  Flicka's was a huge disappointment!!! They didn't have any food specials on the day we went, and the drink specials were limited to domestic beers. Ugh! Maybe it's livelier at night, but our afternoon experience was bad. The food was bland bar food, and the nachos had already started to cool and congeal by the time they arrived at our table. Big disappointment."
0,"Food was ok, not great....the beef fajitas had quite a bit of fat on them and the overall meal was more Mexican-American than authentic Mexican....prices were reasonable and the service was fine so I give them two and a half stars...."
0,"I was totally bored with everything in this place. The service was so so, the food was so so and unfortunately we didn't get a good view seat so the dining room was so so."
1,Big place in Tempe Marketplace. Lots of outdoor seating. Great for gourmet beer lovers. Didn't try the food but many folks were on dinner dates
0,"This place has REALLY gone downhill since my very first visit. The ONLY thing that keeps me returning is the fact it's the only branch of my bank that's somewhat close to where I work. \n\nThe customer service here needs a lot of improvement, as does the speed of their service. It takes FOREVER to be acknowledged, let alone waited on, for one thing. Last time I came here to deposit my paycheck, I was spoken to in a very rude manner by the male teller in the drive-up. I didn't appreciate that or the fact that I sat in the drive-up for 20 MINUTES before anyone even noticed I was there and waiting! The other gripe is the fact that a car pulled up in the lane beside mine & was served right away. Then someone else pulled up in the ATM lane & I overheard a teller shooting the bull with the customer...all this while I was on my lunchbreak, having to hurry to get back to work, & having to wait!"
0,"I ate there for lunch and when I ordered the burger it came in five minutes.   On the way out saw the cook warming some pre cooked burgers on the grill.  If I wanted a pre cooked burger I could of just gone to McDonalds and it wouldn't have cost me 16 bucks,  I expected better."
0,"20 oz beers OK, but  $8 for that beer, hrm. Loud thumping music makes it difficult to have a conversation - on the phone or otherwise. If you've got to wait for a plane, meh, it's alright, but wouldn't be my first choice in the future."
0,"we are familiar with Popey's (West coast version of this restaurant) so we thought, great! Landed late at the airport, let's go get some of their famous Dirty Rice, Fried chicken and fixings.  When we finally reached the order box at the drive through order station, the young lady's voice kept cutting in and out of the speaker.  We thought :\""well there must be something wrong with the microphone or their speaker box and continued on to pay. As we reached the payment window a man was at the window asking for $7 for the supreme meal, we said, \""no, we ordered the 12pc chicken with dirty rice, you know your supreme package with all the fixings.  He walks away waves his hand and yells at someone to come take the order right, this young african american comes up, asks why we dont want the supreme meal box and continually shuts the service window on us as we are trying to tell her we ordered the family meal. She turns around slams the window shut again and throws her hands up and walks off with this attitude!  Never comes back or to tell us what the price of the meal is going to be...she just abandoned us at the pick up window!  We have never been to this side of the state before....is this how you all treat your customers? No wonder Disney World is making a killing in this side of the woods!  There's got to be better employees than this...\n\nSuffice it to say we will NEVER eat at your restaurants in this area if your employees are this horrible to their customers.  We will not frequent any of your businesses here because of your poor training methods."
0,"I had my brand new 2014 Mazda 6  car tinted here and I must say that the tint job was not \""amazing.\"" Lots of bubbling, messed up my plastics on one side and the attention to  detail was horrible. The owner is a very nice guy but that does not excuse him from the bad job.He did try to correct some of the problems like when he burned the plastic on one side of my window panels but I still had to come back with other issues that needed fixing. Its just not worth it.  Also the HID that I had installed by him had multiple issues just like the tint. Shell out the cash because you do get what you pay for."
1,"My boyfriend and I went to this very special restaurant in September for his BD. We went to the L'Atelier du Joel Robuchon the previous year and really enjoyed it, so we were excited to try this. And it didn't disappoint. I felt like I was inside a jewel box. The colors and textures are beautiful. Rather than go into a blow-by-blow of our evening, which many others have done really well, I will say that we enjoyed the entire experience from start to finish. Everything was divine...from that tantalizing bread cart all the way to dessert. The service was impeccable. This is a very special place...a really unique experience that we will not soon forget...if ever!"
1,"Pacific Sales is not your run of the mill appliance store. They close at 6pm and they are not open on Sundays. Pacific Sales caters to a specific clientele of people who know what they want. \n\nTheir selection of built-in appliances and specialty fixtures (farmhouse sinks etc) are pretty good. If you're looking for Viking, Thermador or Wolf appliances, this is probably the place to be at. They can special order pretty much anything from the brands that they do carry. \n\nPacific Sales also price matches (except AJ Madison and other online-only retailers) and they offer pretty good discounts on holidays and on some floor models. You have up to 3 months to cancel your order if not yet delivered. \n\nIf you have a special kitchen in mind, I'd try to get down to Pacific Sales on a Saturday since that's the only day they keep reasonable hours for the 9-5 employee."
0,"This is the black hole of Qdobi, after which you will be asking yourself why you didn't hold out for the friendly service, authentic cuisine, and upscale atmosphere of Taco Bell.\n\nBy the time you're done here, you'll feel the sort of existential despair that's shared only by staff in the Sears shoe department. The place is always empty-ish, always reeking of desperation, always cluttered with a slow-moving line (even if you're the only customer, there will somehow be a slow-moving line), and always fundamentally bland and mediocre, with small portions, too.\n\nIt's not even really cheap, other than by comparison to the Scottsdale prices surrounding it. You probably will not die of eating here, but count on having real doubts about whether life is worth living. Also: do not order the pulled pork. It's vile."
0,"I'm done with Ulta - with this store and their online store. I placed an order on their online store. A week later I was told that the order still hadn't shipped and it would be another week before it did. I was out of makeup, so I decided to cancel the order and just swing by the store  to grab it. I called and waited on hold for 45 minutes. The automated message said that I could contact them via email instead of waiting for a customer service agent. I finally gave up and sent an email. \n\nA week later, I received the package. I took the unopened package to the store, explained what happened and asked for a refund. The snotty cashier told me she couldn't accept the return because I didn't have a specific code. I told her the box was unopened - everything needed for a refund should be there. We opened the box, and she still needed a specific code. I walked out with the opened box, the product, and no refund.\n\nFAIL, Ulta. After I specifically asked you to CANCEL MY ORDER, you sent it anyway, and then you package the order without the proper paperwork for a refund? I promise you, I will not step foot in  your stores except to get my full refund. Nor, will I ever order from you again.\n\nWell, hello, Sephora. It's nice to meet you."
1,this place is amazing!!!! go see mai!!
0,"This place is horrible!!! So unorganized!! They have a bunch of ditzy airhead girls working the front desk and the entire staff talks to you as if youre an alien!! The first time I came, I felt like I was on some hidden game show... They even made me sit in the lobby for 20 minutes with the numbing cream on my chin! Really?!?! The only reason I'm back is because I have a groupon to finish out! With that said too... They totally skimped on the laser treatment!! I wanted my chin/jawline and they said the could only do the immediate chin and the jawline would be an extra $25/side!\nI will never come back here nor recommend it!!!!! No wonder they need groupons and living social deals to stay in business!!"
0,"Ordered the breakfast enchiladas, took forever to get our meal. When it finally arrived it was barley warm, the tortillas were hard on the outside, the pork on the inside barley visible, ordered eggs over easy one was over easy the other was broken and overdone. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. PRCEY FOR TWO ENCHILADAS."
1,"Gary was great.  Arrived on time, did an outstanding job cleaning carpet and four microfiber chairs.  What a difference.  I found him on Yelp (THANKS).  The park had four carpet cleaners listed, none actually cleaned carpet.  I think the park should put Moore and Sons on their list!"
0,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. The sweet potato fries was burnt and over fried. The trifecta crawfish tasted bland and lacked flavor. However, the severs and staff are friendly."
0,"This review is for breakfast only.  \n\nUnbelievably bad breakfast. Wobbly table, bad service, had to ask for salt, pepper, napkin and silverware. Cream for coffee was old and curdled, sausage was disgusting, eggs not the way I ordered them. Coffee lousy too. I recommend you eat anywhere but here for breakfast. Seemed like cafeteria food."
1,"Great food, ordered for pickup and they had our food ready quickly. We had pad Thai with seafood and tofu plus chicken satay. Great light sauce paired with peanut sauce!"
1,"One of the best burgers...period! Just had the pork belly bun, amazing! And the oxtail  chili cheese fries are scrumdeliumtious!! The service needs some work. Our server only came to our table 3 times and our water was empty longer than I liked. But overall, awesome!"
0,Terrible service. Drive thru takes forever! and they can't take a minute to check if they have an ingredient. Instead they just lie and say they don't have it. Go to another location. don't start your day here.
0,"To whom it may concern,\n\n\nI have recently stayed at the Venetian for my 21st birthday. Their customer service was terrible. First, I arrived into my suite and did not realize that there was a sign on the fridge that mentions that we get charged if the beverages were removed. I removed it without knowing and put my own beverages into the fridge. Then I realized that I would have gotten charged I immediately called the front desk and they offered to send someone in to check the fridge to make sure that nothing was opened and to waive the fee if nothing was opened. The following day  I was still concerned on if anyone has shown up to see the refreshments and I called the front desk again to ask for someone to come up to check.  Also, there were many things broken in the room and a repair man came to help fix them so we could avoid and charges happening after our stay. My boyfriend was inside the hotel room all day and did not see anyone come to check our refreshments. We made another call and a person at front desk said that they will just waive the fee for us. We were not informed anything about refreshment \""restocking\"" fee.  On Sunday morning we called for more blankets and pillows at 5:48am and still did not get them until I finally tired of waiting for them until 6:45am outside my room. I went down to the front desk and tried to get them myself and finally around 7am pillows and blankets were sent to our room. Finally, Sunday afternoon someone has come up to our hotel room to check the refreshments. This was a very misleading situation because we were informed that our refreshment fees got waived. We were really confused because we have been informed that it has been taken care of. I have talked to many front desks employees and managers that were informing us that the refreshment fees would be taken care off. I am really upset with the customer service that I have dealt with this past weekend. I left to come back home still feeling unsure about the refreshment situation and my bill. I called today to try to find out how much I was billed and the front desk did not want to help me and said that they would just email me my receipt and tried getting me off the phone not answering my question. Then I have called the Venetian again and spoke to a male front desk person and explaining him the situation about the refreshments and informing him that there were the repair man and the front desk person reassuring us that we would get our refreshments fees waived. He was very understanding about our situation, but wanted to run through the manager. At first the manager stated that I was informed many times about the $50 restocking refreshment fee, but that is totally false. They argued that they have it on their notes that I was informed. Then they tried to say that I stated that I had the drinks in the bathroom. I have meant that the drinks were my own beverages in the bathroom. I am very upset with the way Laurie/Lauren the manager that refused to waive the charged and hung up on me when I asked I wanted the person's name that made the note that was informed because I wanted to get them fired. What kind of service is this? I had to call back and ask for her again and tried to get compensation, but she insisted that she was not going to waive the fee and that was that. I am very upset with the Venetian and the way they handles their customers with their policy and their miscommunications. I want to request if there are any taped recordings of my phone calls with the front desk because the manager I had spoken with had claimed that I was notified on every conversation concerning this matter and claimed that I had made statements that allegedly admitted \""facts\"" that I had never said and the contradictory reasoning that was used to deny our claim.  This experience has been a complete disappointment to me and my guests.  I have never been this upset to make a formal complaint, but based on this experience, I will be making sure that neither myself nor anyone that I know will ever be staying at this disgraceful hotel again."
1,"Great time. Highly organized, but be prepared to spend some $$$. Staff is very knowledgeable and extremely accommodating to new and old shooters alike."
0,"Whole Foods, Whole Foods, what can I say?  I had high expectations for your salad/hot foods bar, but your quality has gone downhill.  Last weekend, I went in at around 4pm to your hot food bar to get a late lunch/early dinner.  However, I saw that the food there was the same as what had been sitting there since around 11am (when I went in to grab a juice, which was delicious and FRESH, by the way).  Nonetheless, I grabbed some anyway as I was hungry.  After eating, I went home, and that was when I started to feel sick....very sick.  For the price of a fancy meal at a restaurant ($14.95), I expected better!!!"
0,I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.
1,Yummy. Best in Vegas!!!!
1,I have counted on Susan to work out all the kinks and manage my stress with twice monthly 90 min massages for several years now.  She does it just the way I ask for it and I especially appreciate the time and attention she spends on my feet!\n\nHer prices are very reasonable and I like her soothing off-strip office.   Plan to continue having Susan keep me in top condition until she decides to retire...
1,Yum!  Salsa is divine and you get bean dip as well with the chips!
1,"Like it!\n\nSimple menu and fast service are a good start.  Meals all seem to be a pretty good value for what you receive.  The fingers were fresh & tasty, fries & slaw also very good.  Didn't have that \""I ate a greasy fried lunch\"" feeling an hour later, like some fried stuff will do to you.. that's a huge plus.  Not quite to the high standard of the now-defunct Rock & Roll Fingers, but close.  A solid 4 stars, and will definitely be back."
0,"Work in the area, so I've stopped by with coworkers countless times.  The service has been bad 9 out of 10 times.  But the food is some of the best Indian food in town, lunch specials are really good and the happy hour is great, so until now I just put up with it...\n\n...Until today, when I tried to call in an order and they hung up on me.  Three times.  Literally just clicked the button to end the call without even picking up, and left me in a confused silence - I had full bars.  I hope it was just a phone problem, but honestly, it didn't seem that way. \n\nAlso, splitting a check here is an absolute nightmare.  They write all the checks by hand and refuse to get some form of electronic system.  I understand that splitting a check 10 ways is crazy, but there's only typically 3-4 of us.  Depending on who waits on you, they will throw a fit when you ask to split the bill.  The saving grace though, is there's one waiter who's always really good and will do it for us no problem.  Everytime we go, we pray that we get placed in his section...haha.\n\nHonestly I can't say I won't come back, because there isn't much else in the area and the food itself is really good.   But don't expect any form of hospitality, and don't bother during full-price hours.  The dinner prices aren't work this.  I'm not a fancy restaurant type of person, I don't require top-notch service.  But I'd at least like to not wait 40 minutes for food during my lunch hour, then another 40 for the waitress to bring the bill, and have her get angry at us for trying to pay the damn bill."
0,"Ok I just moved into the area and came into Kusina Ni Lorraine to get some take-out.  This place was extremely busy at the buffet so that usually is a good sign.  My dad bought some entrees and I purchased some dessert items.   I bought 2 karioka sticks, 1 banana que, and 1 halo-halo.  I gave them a $20 bill and received $7 back.  Of course, there is no pricing on any of the items except the halo-halo, which was listed on the board for $4.  At first I thought this was really expensive and after consulting with my wife and dad in the car, my instincts were right.  Being Filipino-American and only being able to speak in English, I felt they definitely decided to pull one over on me and overcharge.  As I was leaving, they were talking about me in Tagalog and I'm not sure exactly what they said but I laughed and they knew I understood.  So when I got home, I anonymously called and asked how much the karioka and banana que are.  They told me $1.99 for the banana que and $1.75 each for the karioka.  So the total should have been $9.50 instead of the $13 I was charged.  I immediately confronted them about the price discrepancy and the lady obviously remembered me coming in and came up with an excuse saying she charged me for a \""large\"" halo-halo that cost $6 instead of $4.  Anyways, you get the point.  The halo-halo and banana q weren't good and the karioka was decent.   My dad ordered sisig and it was soggy.  The other entrees he got weren't that good either.\n\nWe won't be coming back and I'll be sure to tell others not to waste their time here.  It's too bad because they lost potentially long-term customers.  I'm sure there are much better Filipino places in the area that I'll be giving my money to in the future."
0,Well after nearly 20 years with Sprint I am leaving them for another carrier. I have always had great customer service and very little issues with my service or phones. With all that in mind though I am also tired of having to pay for services I don't get in the Phoenix market (which I am in 99% of the time) such as 4G. I also have found that I can get the extras I have to pay for with Sprint I can get from other carriers included within my plan. In addition to all of that the phone I wish to up grade to on Sprint I can get for less on another carrier without an upgrade discount. I had to way out the pros and cons and in the end I would rather pay the extra $12.00 a month and actually get what I am paying for. I had a lot of hope that Sprint would get it together but alas it does not seem that will happen in any foreseeable future.  Sorry for the 2 stars but that's all Sprint deserves anymore. If weren't for my long history with Sprint it would have been 1 star.
1,"Had to take a star due to the Cons.\n\nPROS:  The rooms are big and somewhat comfortable.  I felt that the pillows were too soft.  The casino was a good size.  I would compare this hotel/resort to the Venetian.  Casino was not overly packed and seemed to draw a lot of locals.  I think this was probably the only place that my family and I actually won.  The food court was nice.  In the morning, there was no waiting in lines at the Coffee Bean and after midnight, Fatburger, served up fresh burgers again without a crowd.  The pool was really nice and seemed really clean.  They have a 21 and over pool that is somewhat private, has its own bar and about 20 lounge pool chairs, about 10 cabana's and probably 4 to 6 pool beds.  The main pool has a sand entry beach and nice view of the strip.  \n\nCONS:  The DOWNSIDE of this hotel/resort is the carpets although looking clean are really dirty!!  Stay as far away from China Spice Restaurant as possible!!! The first night we tried this place because we were offered \""$25\"" off when you spend $50 but only applies to food not drinks with alcohol.  The wait was 20 minutes with about 5 tables open and only 1 whole server working.  If you want to eat within an hour I highly recommend staying as far away from this restaurant as possible.  After being seated it took 20 minutes to place an order not because they were busy but because the waitress had the flap her gums syndrome (aka talked and socialized way too much).  Then it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks that literately sat on the side bar for 10 minutes and were served at room temperature.  After placing our order it took another 20 minutes to get COLD food!! Not even warm, like it was placed straight on a plate from the refrigerator!! When my mother told the waitress that the food was cold, the waitress turned to me and asked if she was telling the truth.  Shame way to start our trip and shame that this restaurant is even open to serve the public with all the unprofessional and rude service it provides.  I guess the up side was the our drinks got comp."
1,Pretty good restaurant. I think I liked the root beer there the most. Got the sour dough sandwich and added some thousand island on it and it was pretty amazing. A little heavy on the grease though. My friends sandwich was a lot greasier though. Fries are nothing to write home about. Just basic crinkle cut fries and the onion rings were lack luster too. Got myself a pint of the mint oreo frozen custard to take home and try. Overall has a good atmosphere. Good for large crowds and kids and you are able to really make anything unique and to your liking.
1,"5 stars for food. Knocked one off for sour puss server. Would it kill you to smile? \nWe got the sleepy dog red rover irish ale and kilt lifter beers. Both were so good and chilled to perfection. The mac and cheese burger was calling our name which we answered with a pretzel bun, of course. The best burger I've ever had,  no joke. We will be back and hopefully we won't get the same debby downer server."
0,"Moved here unknowingly from out of state upon my honorable discharge from the army. It could have been better.\n\n1 - I was robbed from this location because security is a joke. Don't let them fool you with \""we have nighttime roving security\"". I lost track of how many times I've seen security sitting down with earphones in.\n\n2 - Unless you live directly around the clubhouse, there's no camera coverage for you in case something occurs...like a burglary!\n\n3 - Management is ok. The junior employees are helpful and nice. Can't say much for anybody above them...\n\n4 - Again; security - I don't know if they're tenants waiting to get in but everyone and their mother waits for a tenant with a gate opener to enter the property. Or waits for someone exiting to enter the property. How about get some one-way spike strips? The gate to tenant calling operation is crap. You MUST have a 702 number to operate it to open the gate for yourself.\n\n5 - Can't speak for anybody else but if you're on the first floor, bugs central.\n\n6 - I cleaned the hell out of these apartments when I left, and still owed some on my deposit. I over-cleaned personally having moved into a less than stellar apartment.\n\n7 - The property is nice. Very green and well groomed. Outside of the apartments is good too. Very close to the Galleria Mall and Costco. If you're a Costco shopper.\n\nOverall, keep looking but it's not the worst place to move into. Good luck on your search!"
0,"Good bagels, great price, TERRIBLE service. More times than not, they screw up my order & have a very poor attitude. I once ordered an bagel w a side of cream cheese. I got to the car. Wrong bagel, no cream cheese. Not a difficult order. I told the manager who corrected the bagel but argued that he didnt charge me for the cream cheese. No matter how many times I reapeated  \""I know, you didnt charge me for it but I ordered it & didnt get it\"" he couldnt get it. It was busy in there & he began raising his voice at me & causing a scene. I was VERY put off to say the least. We keep going back because the bagels are pretty good & very cheap but man..they need to really get their act together."
0,"I dont know why we keep trying this place except the location is convenient.  The wait staff is always rude (we have been re-trying this place for 5 years now, and after this morning we won't be back) Food is ok, and prices are high for a Dennys and they nickel and dime for everything. We shared a couple better establishments with our fellow Tahiti Village owners within walking distance, with great service and food and prices!"
1,"Friend Alexander C. said this place is good, so I whipped on in there today for lunch.  As a big eater, I ordered a (Pastrami) Hero, & a salad.  Nooooooooooooooooooooo, you don't want to do that!!!  I practically needed a forklift to get my tray to the table!  Either the sandwich OR the salad is \""all you can eat\"" & then some!\n\nThis stylish, clean, comfortable deli restaurant actually faces 1st Ave. a little above Adams.  My service was fast & very friendly, even though it was the lunch rush, & both my Pastrami & Chicken Club Salad were delicious.  I filled up, & still have about half of my order here in the fridge for Marty Cat & I to enjoy later.\n\nThey serve a variety of different breakfast & lunch items, & are open Monday through Friday from 6 to 3.  The hero sandwiches run about $7 to $8 & can serve two.  The big salads run about $6 to $7 & are a complete meal.\n\nYou'll like this place!     :-))"
1,Great for steak and eggs at 3 am!!  Extremely cheap with a players card! One of my favorite late night spots. The lemons were cut prefect. But the chicken fingers were kinda gross.. but the lemons make this place a 4 star place
0,"What a mess.\n\nFirst, I called to make reservations for 6:00 PM.  I called at 1:00 and they put me on hold for 10 minutes.... to make a reservation.\n\nI called back an hour later and made the reservation.  When I showed up, they didn't have it.\n\nThey told me we would have to wait for 40 minutes, even though the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  (That's another sign.  Where is the business during Friday dinner).\n\nThey seated us early.  Didn't matter.  It took an hour to get the food.  I could hear the manager apologizing to another table next to us, so it must be common.  \n\nNot only that, people who showed up later got their food earlier.  And the food?  Nice and cold.\n\nBoycott this place.  Maybe we can get a better restaurant to replace it."
0,"I'm pretty sure this was the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I know that's quite a charge, but it is well deserved. \n\nwe were tempted to leave when we arrived and were greeted by an empty restaurant with an overpriced ($21!!) omelette bar. When my son touched the rail next to some stairs his hands came off black!\n\nWe say down anyway. We ordered some omelettes and French toast and asked if we could substitute anything for the potatoes and toast (we are eating low carb). The waitress offered bacon and fruit instead.\n\nthe omelettes were poor to mediocre. Bell peppers were used instead of \""green chiles.\"" The cheese tasted cheap. Definitely not worth $9.50. Any hotel buffet omelette is better.\n\nThen we get the bill, they charged us $3 for each bacon substitute ($3 for 2 slices of bacon as a 'substitute'?!) and $3 for each little fruit bowl that had been offered as a substitute! Also, whipped cream was added to my daughter's French toast, a nice touch but something we didn't order and we were charged for that too. So two omelettes and French toast came to $40! \n\nAfter much harassment and lecturing from a very rude  manager she agreed to remove the extra charges after I adamantly stated that I would not pay for what I did not order. \n\nWe left unimpressed with the food, disgusted by the service, and understanding why the restaurant was empty. I don't think we have to worry about them staying in business for very long."
1,"I had heard about this place for years but never went. Tragic I know! Just recently I discovered that it was literally walking distance from Jester'Z Improv where I work. Oh, how i must now make up for lost time!\n\nPop the Soda Shop is a true place of brilliants. They have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff. When you come to pops that is what you are looking for, product. And they have the best selection in town. \n\nA couple of recommendations. Doctor Eli's Blueberry, Jackson Hole Huckelberry, or really any thing in the Birch Beer section!"
1,"Came here for a pool party my football organization paid for.  The Falls is what the pool area is called and it was great for kids and lots of fun.  Service was a little slow for drinks sometimes but overall a great experience, I forget how nice some of the pools are in the local area."
1,"This place is less than a minute's walk from my work, which is not great for my bikini diet plan. It's one of those things that you just can't say no to, it's that good.\n\nThe clue's pretty much in the name, they serve burgers and not a lot else. But they serve amaaaaazing burgers, that not only have proper cheese on them unlike most fast food places or even some pubs, but the exact type of cheese chosen specifically by you. And that goes for the garnishes, sauces, the bun, how well-done the burger's cooked etc, etc, etc. Basically, if you leave here having just eaten something that you didn't love then you'll have no-one to blame but yourself.\n\nYou do pay for the privilege, though. It would need to be one hell of a hangover in my book to justify spending the best part of \u00a320 on a cure for it on too regular a basis...!"
0,"My fiance and I were walking around the miracle mile mall with two of our friends. We wanted to grab a bite to eat before we left and headed back home from our weekend in vegas. We walked by oyster bay and decided to try it out. We liked the ambiance. \nwe were seated in the \""outdoor\"" eating area, so we could watch the rain shower that happens every 30 or 45 minutes right near the restaurant.  \nWe ordered our food once we could track the waiter down. I ordered a salad and my fiance ordered fish and chips.  My fiance got 2 very small silvers of fish, the average mozzarella sick is larger than the little piece of fish he got. My salad was on a the same plate as the bread plate. It was so small i was able to count the prices of lettuce...12 small pieces. \nWe decided to tell our waiter.....he took my fiances plate..(he had taken one bite).....he came back and said he was going to talk to the manager  but she was on the phone..he then brings the same plate of food back and says they will cook one more piece.  As for my salad he said that it was their lunch size, i told him then it should be alot cheaper than 10 dollars. ( i had to go pick up fast food on the way out so i wasn't hungry on the drive home) \nWe asked to speak to a manager because once a plate is taken off the table it should not be brought back and served, it goes against health standards. The manager was very rude and said that we were out of hand. We were more just bringing it to her attention, before they got in trouble.  \n\nmy friends got an omelettes, they were over priced for the size of them but they enjoyed it. \n\n\nlong store short we will not be back."
0,"It pains me to write this review because I wanted to like this place I really really wanted to.  After this list of things that went wrong sadly the good things don't add enough stars to make me up the rating.\n\nThe decor and the staff will bring this rating up to 2 stars versus 0 if I had that option.  Upon check in the staff were nice the decor really fun and cool.  But beware when walking in because it is really really dark after coming in from outdoors.  Not knowing the layout of the lobby many obstacles may get in your way as yours eyes are adjusting.  We check into a small clean room in a gothic kind of decor pretty cool.  Sadly 2 of the 4 rooms we had, the air-conditioning broke.  The staff worked hard on it and it worked well enough to not want to repack and move rooms.  As mentioned in previous posts there are speakers located all around the hotel with Techno music blasting.  I did not mind this much because we were here for a party not a spa day...  Sadly after a couple of drinks I got off on the wrong floor and was trapped there for a bit because the elevator wouldn't stop on that floor for me.  If you go the stairs route please be very careful the railings are not secure and extremely wobbly.  \n\nSo with all these things mentioned one thing capped the experience off and as I sit here writing I am still thinking of dropping the extra star.  The Artisan is a Valet only hotel which is fine because I really wouldn't want my car sitting in an open lot across the street anyways.  So you always hear stories about your car getting a joy ride or a scratch or something crazy happens in the movies right?!  Not in real life, right?!?!   Yes, it happens in real life sadly it happened to me.  Upon check out the Valet goes to get my car and comes back after a bit and says he can't get the key in the ignition.  So I take the key and say \""ahh, ok let me try\""  Go out to the car and as I try I notice my key is bent.  Well, that will do it!  SERIOUSLY try to take your key right now and bend it, go ahead try you won't be able to.  I have no idea what the heck they did to bend my key!  What ever they did was extreme because car keys really don't bend!  LOL   The staff again is kind and tried to help me but the Valet is hired out so there is only so much that can be done on their part so I will leave the extra star. \n\n I will be dealing with the company who is hired to get my key replaced but sadly my experience at the Artisan is marred beyond fixing.  I don't know if I will ever be back I certainly won't drive if I am..."
1,"Netflix offers a good service for the money.  Streaming + 2 disks out at a time for less than it would cost for me and one other to go to the movies once.\n\nTo answer the review by Rahul who talked about the delay between Netflix and being able to purchase a disk: I feel your pain, but that is not Netflix's fault, but rather the movie studios who FORBID Netflix to rent until the disk has been available for purchase for a month or so.  Remember that Netflix doesn't own the movies any more than you do when you buy them, and they have to abide by the license agreement if they don't want to be sued into oblivion."
1,"I've never really enjoyed buffets, but my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. I never really felt like I could get a good meal at a buffet but I was wrong. \n\nThe sushi was really good. They had at least 10 different rolls and not just the basic rolls but stuff like Rainbow rolls and the likes. Tried them all and they were all very good. They had one sushi chief just throwing out rolls cause the sushi was going fast. They also had tempura which included lots of vegetables plus shrimp. \n\nThey had a meat bar with prime rib, Chinese BBQ ribs, & sausage. The ribs are really good. Nice and sweet. You have to try these ribs.The sausage is ok and didn't try the prime rib but looked good. Lots of good Chinese food with lots of seafood in it and I enjoyed it. There was also a cold bar with salads and fresh fruit. Lastly, they have a pretty good desert bar where they have a server scoop out the ice cream. \n\nSo overall, they have lots of selections of different kinds of food but most important it's all fresh. You could tell that none of the dishes have been sitting out there for a long time. Very fresh and hot. \n\nService was good. Picking up our dirty dishes and filling up our water glasses in a timely manner. All I can say is that the food is really good, lots of variety to satisfy everybody, but the best part is that if you Check-in you get a 20% off your bill. \n\nEnjoy and have a really good meal."
0,"This place used to be great, but it's sad to see what it has turned into. One of their selling points was a variety of classes that were available from 5 am to 11 pm. Now they have very limited classes that are jammed packed with signs stating that's tips are mandatory. Very low class! They no longer offer shampoo or conditioner in the locker rooms and have no place to hang a towel while in the shower. The staff is very unorganized when it comes to class cards and often forget to pass them out. I recently renewed my membership after taking a few months off and needless to say....had I taken a few classes before renewing, I wouldn't have renewed. The only reason I keep coming back is because the instructors are awesome."
1,"Vegas Computer Doctor ROCKS!  They fixed an iMac that, without a doubt, would have had to been 'junked' had it been taken to a dealer. Thank goodness I found Vegas Computer Doctor...Armando's patience and calm helped me get back a great machine...and avoid a lot of $$$.  They're trustworthy and reliable."
0,"2 days after I checked out, I'm STILL getting random charges on my card from the Plaza hotel & Casino. When I called, I got the run around telling me it was an error that SHOULD have been charged when I checked out but when I had her break down exactly what I was being charged for, she couldn't explain it.\nI ended up disputing charges on my card and my card company refunded everything except the room fee I agreed to originally. I don't mind paying for a room, but when they start getting shady with their billing practices, that's when I tell everyone to steer clear and never spend another dime on their company again.\nBEWARE BEWARE BEWARE"
1,"This beautiful hotel is located in the perfect spot right off the Royal Mile.  It is easy to walk to the Palace or Castle from this location.  The staff was friendly and courteous during my entire stay. I greatly enjoyed staying here for a week with my family while visiting the wonderful city of Edinburgh.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast has a good variety of hot meats, eggs, beans, cold fruits, cereal, bread and croissants.\n\nThe rooms are nicely decorated and the bathrooms are large.  My only complaint is inconsistencies with the cleaning staff.  They did not change my towels.  I am fine with using the same towels for a few days, but what really bothered me was the fact that they didn't change the washcloths.  I finally left a note with a tip requesting clean washcloths, and I received one.  I didn't receive any more clean washcloths until I again left a note with a tip.  Also, they didn't leave new water in the fridge or tea packets daily, just from time to time.  I did, however get a little bonus of lip balm and a face spray one day next to my soap."
1,We had a family lunch today. The staff allowed us to reserve (without advance notice) the back room. We all had a great lunch. It was everyone's first time (except the wife and me). Everyone really enjoyed what they ordered.  There was 17 of us (10 adults and 7 grand children).  I wish the whole family could have been there..\nI had not in my 20 + years ordered or seen the hamburgers they serve there. They are huge!  A couple of us don't care for fish. Anyway they said the burgers were great.\n\nThank you Knock Kneed Lobster for a great lunch and for the great service and friendly atmosphere. You helped make a good memory.
1,"Note:  West Harris Cleaners offers cleaning service from a kiosk at my office park.\n\nThis is my default cleaner... very competitive prices and best quality cleaning I've had in my years here in Charlotte.  I bring all my stuff here and my girlfriend's dry-cleaning as well.  Same day service is stellar and owners are very friendly.  \n\nThere may be a few cheaper places out there if you search, but their quality is horrible (always busting my buttons) and service is not as prompt/quick as WHC.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this place!"
1,"So I was a bit sad when Moonstruck was no longer in this location. And then I discovered that Cocomere was a pay by the oz frozen yogurt place. Sad no longer.\n\nThe interior is nice and bright and happy, which is also how I feel when I grab my cup and start loading up on flavors. I'm a Libra. We're indecisive people. So when I'm able to select 4 different yogurt flavors, and 10 different toppings and still only pay about $6 for a ginormous cup, life is happy. I am happy.\n\nOn a sweltering day like today in Chicago, I am so tempted to drive down to Chambana and indulge myself. It's that good (that and Chicago SUCKS for the lack of pay by the oz fro yo). Yum."
1,Hands down what a great experience it was for us. We came in a little after 10:00am and were greeted right off the bat by a very nice gentlemen. He asked where we were from and explained what we could do and if we bought stuff he would have them sign it. So we walked around a little and toured the shop. We then bought some merchandise and other guy took our stuff and got it signed. The General then came out and we took pics and talked a bit. These guys are so down to earth and fame sure as not gone to their heads! We then went into the office for a quote on a tank and ran into Brett. Talked with him a little and took a pic! Great place to visit and made a trip complete! Thanks for a great time ATM!! You guys and gals rock!!
0,"I was waiting for my friend to show up for a concert across the street, and decided to get a quick bite to eat. I always see this place and decided why not. \n\nBig mistake. I walked in and sat at the counter. I had to ask for the counter to be cleaned/wiped, and still ended up wiping it again myself after they finished. Then it took a few minutes before i was greeted. After placing my order, I waited and waited. \n\nOnce the order came, that was the final disappointment. The home fries, were under-cooked. I asked for cheese on them, and they added a few sprinkles of finely shredded cheddar. They barely let the cheese melt. The sausage was ok.  The bacon was 2 teeny weenie strips that appeared to be under-cooked also. \n\nOverall disappointing experience!"
1,"Cool new venue! \n\nOnly been open for a few months, but Andrea's is a perfect fit into the Encore's line of fine dining. The ambiance is very chique and hip, great list of wines and cocktails, and excellent food choices. We had a large partry (10+), and they were very accomodating. We tried a bunch of little plates / appitizers, and they were all delicious (the Wagyu Beef Tataki was my personal fave).  For dinner, I had the Seared Ahi salad (delicious) and the Wagyu Rib Cap (most flavorful steak I've had in months) - however, it was only 6 oz....which is kinda small. \n\nCome here hungry, cuz almost everything sounds delicious, and their dessert menu is something you don't want to skip! (we tried the trio sampler, and all three were awesome)."
0,Food is good but had a gift card and apparently they are location specific gift cards very stupid u offer gift cards they should be good at all your locations even if they are independently owned and operated
0,I AGREE with g bb they hit me with a $300 bill for a leaky bathtub drip....it was fixed in like 10 minutes
0,"This location is awful! HORRIBLE customer service. Not one employee smiled at us or greeted us. After we already ordered they told us that they were out of the pumpkin shmear, (which is the only reason we went) and we told them that we would like a refund and we will go to a different location. They rudely gave us a refund and while we were walking out told us that the pumpkin season was over and would not find it anywhere else. Why would they not inform us of this before we ordered and before our refund. Not to mention that advertisement of the pumpkin items are located all over their store. Because of their extremely poor customer service, we will never be returning to this location, and I suggest you save yourself from a bad mood and find a different location as well."
1,The staff is a hit or miss which is awesome for a Chinese restaurant! \n\nMost recently I had a nice female server who returned often and was very sweet. \n\nThe complimentary bitter melon soup is delicious to start.\n\nI'm a big fan of their honey walnut shrimp and their crispy pan fried egg noodles is my favorite in town.\n\nThe seating is very close to each other. \n\nThe pricing is average for non Americanized Chinese food around china town.
0,"I've been willing to brave the crackheads and derelicts because the prices are so much cheaper than Vons. Finally had my fill. Staff is constantly changing, horribly mismanaged and rude. Expired food on display bleh. Deli is a mess. From the chubby guy with missing bolts in his floppy ears that just refuses to smile, to the skinny tweeker that likes to call me honey and wink at me, this place can be a tad unnerving. At this point I'm willing to pay the extra for a cleaner safer shopping experience elsewhere."
1,"Veracruz makes an effort to distinguish itself from the standard big burrito or Tex Mex chains, and these efforts  pay off.\n\nChorizo, barbacoa, and al pastor double wrapped tacos are now on the menu, as well as other authentic Mexican dishes like chilaquiles and sopes. Authentic Mexican food is a rare find in Oakland (let alone Pittsburgh), so these tasty dishes make Veracruz worth a visit. \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the aforementioned foods, I suggest you dive in and try them regardless of your personal reservations. Otherwise, Veracruz is simply average in terms of Americanized Mexican fare, such as nachos, quesadillas, and burritos. I actually prefer nearby Chipotle or Qdoba for Ameri-Mex. On a positive note, anything with their earthy, smoky chicken chili is decent, their guacamole is fresh and light, and their homemade red chili and avocado salsas are zesty and tasty.\n\nRelatively cheap prices and a student discount is the icing on the cake (or the guac on the nachos, I guess). Service varies highly depending on who's taking your order."
1,"Very yummy ice cream. 3 main types - Asian, regular ice cream, and vegan. Had the regular chocolate/peanut butter, and the regular banana chocolate chip."
1,"We have been here s couple of times, once for wine, once for dinner. I got a calzone for dinner. It is huge. It was good I would order it again. (However, you need to ask for sauce).  The other night a friend brought over a pizza...fresh mozzarella and pepperoni. By the time he got to our house it was cold, but it was still really good. \n\nI think their wine is a bit over priced...and while they offer 1/2 price bottles on Wednesdays, you can still find the same bottles/years at other restaurants for far less than their regular price.  \n\nOverall, I like the atmosphere and I will be back to try more dishes."
1,"Pretty darn good!\n\nI usually eat at Unphogettable because that is my fiance's favorite place, but Pho Ao Sen makes my favorite spring rolls!  The presentation is fun!  I love the extra lettuce bursting out of the spring roll.  I also personally like the peanut sauce at Pho Ao Sen over Unphogettable.  \n\nThe decor is nice.  The place is clean.  The service is good.  It's the most expensive Vietnamese restaurant I go to in Arizona, but not by much."
1,"We spent a week in this family friendly time share hotel, got the 2 bedroom \""villa\"" compliments of my sis.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well thought out this place is.  With a full kitchen, washer and dryer, I totally overpacked since my mama was doing laundry everyday for some reason.  The rooftop pool is a nice touch but it's a bit small for so many people.  And the smoking area by the tiny \""rooftop bar\"" is a bit disturbing especially considering most kids hang out by the pool.  The mandatory complimentary valet is a bit frustrating as well.  But besides from that, this is a nice place to stay.  We had 3 LCD TV's, 42 incher in the living room and 32 incher in each of the bedrooms so we can all watch our own programming.  The DVD player and full stereo set up also make the week go by faster.  Word of advise, it's really a bore to stay in Vegas for an entire week with seniors and kids."
1,Excellent! Went here for a last minute nail appointment with Mai and was very happy! Everyone there was very nice. Most the customers were regulars which says a lot about the quality. I would definitely go again. :-)
1,"Loudons used to be a regular haunt of mine. When it first opened a few years ago, it was a hub for freelance workers, laptops at hand, fuelled on coffee. A perfect working spot, with huge windows, lots of natural light and space, and really delicious, fresh food and baked goods (bye bye S'Bucks).\n\nThen a wee change happened and it suddenly became *the* meeting spot for Yummy Mummies. I remember one Thursday afternoon counting, and there were a grand total of 14 babies in the caf\u00e9. Now this isn't a fault of Loudons, and actually a sign of how lovely the caf\u00e9 is. It just meant that I gradually stopped coming more and more as, well, babies do not good colleagues make.\n\nSo when we came to Loudons for a birthday brunch for Miss Kelly F a few Sundays ago, I was overjoyed. I suddenly remembered why I used to come here so often. The huge table of cakes that greets you when you walk, all baked downstairs fresh in house. The hearty portions. The Artisan Roast coffees and delicious teas. And, yes, the natural light, open space, and buzz inside.\n\nAs Valerie has pointed out, at the weekend they now only serve brunch instead of any lunch options, till 3pm. I would also say this is a bit of a nuisance, as not everyone loves eggs and bacon. But I do, so I was ok with this. But knowing how good their regular lunch optoins are, like salmon and chicken salad sandwiches, I did wish they had other options.\n\nThey have gluten free bread, and always have some sort of gluten free and dairy free cake. So many caf\u00e9s in Edinburgh now stock Love Pure Cakes, Love Crumbs, Mrs C's etc and whilst they are wonderful in their own right, the thing I like about Loudons is you won't find the cakes here anywhere else in Edinburgh, as they're all baked in house.\n\nIt's slightly out of the way, off the not-very-inspiring Lothian Road, so I imagine doesnt get much passing trade. But whether you're a visitor or local to Edinburgh, I'd recommend this as a weekend brunch spot. Perfect place to chill out with the papers for a few hours and eat a very delicious brunch."
0,"Not really diverse. Price is high. You're really just paying for the presentation. Let's face it, nothing is cheap at the bellagio. Lol. Food was okay. Nothing spectacular. Husband liked the tres leches dessert. First time trying, and it wll be our last."
0,"My first 1-star review. Why include the word \""dumpling\"" in the name when you have hardly any dumplings on the menu? .:. Came here for dim sum and was not happy. In retrospect, the pad thai on the dim sum menu should have warned me. The pork was incredibly dry, the shu mai tasted plastic, the red bean buns were pre-packaged/microwaved (recognized the wrapper), and I had to actually dip into the crispy noodles in order to satiate myself. Then I ate all the fortune cookies for our table. \n\nNo qualms with the fast service (hence the 1 star) but I'm afraid that's more due to lack of diners."

0,"Stayed here for three days in July for Cake Camp, a conference and workshop for cake decorating business.  I was very impressed by the decor and design of the lobby and the public areas: very posh, but not too glitzy and overwhelmingly 'vegas'.  I was upgraded to a 'pool view' room which happened to be ADD accessible. \n\nThe room was decorated nicely and had upscale finishes, but there was a definite lack of attention to detail.  The lamp on the desk had a very bent shade, the towel/robe hooks in the bathroom were all crooked, my message light on my phone blinked all the time, walls were thin and there was a very pissed off little dog a few doors down, the TV remote wasn't much help, the phone only called the front desk,  the key card reader to the hotel from the nearest entry point in the casino didn't work so I had to go around and about to the lobby and back up to the tower to access my room, and there was no in room book of services or restaurants. When i called down to inquire, he said that it was being redesigned. He gave me a run down of the restaurants in the hotel/casino, but really how was I going to remember a list of 12 places? There was a set of brochures for the spa and room service, but not even a CVB town guide or a hotel map.  (i did call down to mention the damaged light so I wouldn't get charged, and was told maintenance would replace it. never happened). \n\nThe meeting rooms were overall nice and the banquet food was good plus the $10/glass of house wine made it taste all the better (seriously, how do they get away with that markup!).  The pool looked nice, but I didn't have time to visit. And with a 7 p.m. close except for the tiny hot tub (so i heard, didn't see it on a map), it seemed a bit unreasonable--especially considering night swimming is the most comfortable option for July in the desert. \n\nAnd I wonder if I am the only one who visits from out of town who is a bit confused by the \""We LOVE Locals\"" campaign going on through the entire hotel. Yeah, I came 500 miles to stay here for a conference, sure glad you 'heart' locals the best!"
0,"An acquaintance of mine convinced me to have a drink here. When I got to the top of the stairs I wish I had refused. This wasn't the worst the bar I've ever been to, but one that I will never return to again! This just isn't my crowd, and if this is your crowd, you need a new crowd."
0,So after going to Narita for a few years having Howard always making my sushi rolls and always being happy .. I went there 2/15/13 while under new management and was very disappointed ..  I ordered a airport roll off the menu that I have had there probably 100 times and when it arrived at the table it wasn't even close to the same thing and was not advised that it would be when I ordered it .. When I inquired about it I was told that Narita was under new management in a rude manor. Not what can I do to fix it .. I figured I would at least try it .. I could barley get one piece down before sending it back .. It tasted like crap and wasn't close to the original airport roll.. At that point still hungry I asked for my check and left .. The waitress knew that I was upset and never asked to make it right just asked if I wanted it boxed up to go .. I asked her why I would want to take it to go if I thought it tasted so bad to eat there .. And explained that I did not like it and I was still hungry and I was going some where else and would not be back .. Maybe Howard will read some of these reviews and come back before the restaurant goes under .. My advice is for all of you valued customers that used to love Narita: find a new favorite place for sushi .  Sorry to all of you .
0,"I LOOOOOVE roller coasters and I have wanted to ride this one for years, I've been to Vegas probably 10 times and this was the first opportunity I had to ride it.\n\nWhat a letdown.  This coaster is in serious need of revamping.  The over-the-shoulder harness is *extremely* badly designed and since the coaster is far jerkier and less smooth than you'd expect for a metal coaster, your neck smashes into the bars constantly.  I didn't get to pay any attention to the ride because I had to spend most of the time trying (in vain) to hold my head steady so it wouldn't smash again.\n\nIf this ride had smoother tracks and a modern, comfortable shoulder harness, it would be great, but until then, in the words of your friendly neighborhood college student, \""it sucks ass.\""  I am SO glad I only bought a $14 single ride ticket instead of the $25 'all day' ticket that I almost bought."
1,"GREAT comedy venue.  The food and drinks were awesome, the customer service was awesome, the seats were great, and the comedy show was great, too.  Plus there's a great bar right next to it for drinks before and afterwards.  The only down side was the 9:45 PM show started around 11 PM.  But it was worth the wait."
0,Good not very good. Not a very nice restaurant. Styrofoam bowls. I wouldn't come here again.
0,Hard to imagine worse service. Our server failed to enter our beer order and it took 40 minutes to be served - 10 after we reminded her. The other couple with us hadn't received their dinner 30 minutes after we were served - looks like she forgot to enter that one too.
1,"We had an amazing time at Mesa Grill!! From the service, to the ambiance, to the food, everything was fantastic. We started out with the cactus pear margarita--it was a gorgeous pink color and definitely tasty. A little bit too sweet for my taste, but still good and fresh tasting. \n\nWe had the tuna nachos and goat cheese fundido as appetizers. I don't eat seafood but the three other people in our party loved the nachos. I personally loved the goat cheese fundido--really flavorful with bell peppers pieces mixed in. \n\nFor dinner, our table ordered the rib eye, yucatan chicken tacos, and the chile relleno. Oh man, does Bobby Flay know how do flavor! The sauces on each dish were intricate and absolutely amazing. I've never had such a good chile relleno. I don't like eggplant usually,  but I couldn't even tell it was there. The tacos were great as well, with a great mixture of mint and cilantro to top them with (who knew those two mixed so well on tacos?!. The boys loved their rib eye. \n\nOur server was perfect, which made the meal even better. We ended dinner with some Don Julio tequila, great for sipping. Thanks for a wonderful dinner, Mesa Grill!"
1,"Excellent food! Four stars only because it is very pricey. We tried the Burnt Ends, Grits & Pork Belly, Potato Salad, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread, Fries & Alabama White Sauce - all were really good but we will forego the fries for a different side next time just because they were nothing extraordinary."
0,"The food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. I keep coming back, but there's something wrong when I have bad service over half the time.\n\nI don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. I don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. Maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...\n\nEh, who knows. I guess that makes it a \""legitimate\"" Southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. I suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there..."
0,"First time trying this place.  I really wanted to like it because I love English/Irish food.  Walk in the door and seated ourselves (as the sign suggested).  Sat in the booth and waited about 4-5 minutes without being greeted.  Then another guy and his son sat in the booth behind us.  Another few minutes goes by and the guy in the booth behind us gets drinks and orders before we have anyone come over.\n\nWhile we were waiting we noticed a good coating of dust along the booth wall railings, so my wife wrote her name in it.. ugh..\n\nWe were about to leave, when the waitress finally arrived.  You could tell she doesn't like her job.  Ordered fish and chips for myself and the wife had a Ruben.  The place was pretty much empty except for the bar, so the food came out reasonably fast.\n\nMy fish and chips, which cost $15 were three smaller pieces of cod in a basket.  When I pulled one out, it flopped over like a limp noodle.  The outside was coated in grease and the breading was slimy instead of crispy.  They looked burned (either that or the oil is really dirty).  I couldn't believe any self respecting chef or food cook would send that out of the kitchen to be eaten.\n\nI sent it back (the first time this year I've had to send food back).  I felt terrible about wasting good fish, but it wasn't edible.  I ate half of the wife's' Ruben (which was way more kraut/sauce/bread than beef).\n\nNo doubt we'll not be back again, there are much better restaurants to chose from and this place isn't exactly cheap."
0,"If you're buying, you can find plenty of decent deals. However, I wouldn't bother with trying to sell in any children's consignment store. I can bring in boxes of like-new items, and they will consistently only purchase five or six items. You spend an hour organizing and getting the stuff in the car, driving it down there, and then waiting two hours for them to decide what to buy before you drive back again. Not worth the hassle, folks. Put it all on Craigslist and be done with it."
1,"I loved this buffet! As locals we tend to avoid the strip but this was so worth the traffic! I love that is almost more tapas style, than buffet style. There were a couple things that were \""meh\"", like the WAAAAY over cooked saffron risotto , the tepid fish and chips, and some dried out dim sum. However on all of those the flavor was good, especially the risotto, but they were just sitting out too long. The mushroom polenta was mind blowing, and the dessert were phenomenal...really everything else was amazing. Also by pre-dishing most the stuff you waste less food and get to try more dishes. I will most definitely be going back!"
0,This place is overrated. I have been here twice to eat dinner with few friends and the flavors are honestly whatever. I would much rather have In & Out over this place.\n\nBurgers I have tried:\nHell's Kitchen Burger - little bit of kick to it but nothing to write home about\n\nAmerican Burger - just a standard burger that costs $13 dollars. I could have grilled something like this in my backyard.\n\nSides: Truffle Parmesan Fries - these are below average truffle fries. I've had good truffle fries and these have a very very light truffle flavoring. Not Good. The dipping sauce is good.\n\nJust Fries - these are standard french fries. Can't go wrong with this.\n\nThere are much better Burger places in L.A. that are half the cost then this place. Holstein's at Cosmo is much better.
1,Went there for brunch for my aunt's birthday this place was great. I got the wagyu skirt steak and got my eggs poached. It was a perfectly cooked medium rare and the eggs were just right. My grandpa had the pancakes which I suggest trying because one bite and i was hooked. My mother got a mexican twist on eggs benedict which worked really well with jalapeno corn bread instead of english muffins and pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon  My aunt got the steak omelette which looked good but I couldn't try since I'm allergic to avocado. For dessert (like we needed it) we got the tres leche cake which was good but for me had a not so great after taste but maybe it was because of the other stuff I ate. Over all it was good and will go back again for dinner. On a side note my mom got the bottomless bloody mary which is totally worth it since one is $9 and the bottomless is $20 and it had to be the biggest glass of bloody mary I've seen so be prepared to get a lil tipsy early in the day :)
0,"This hotel has poor customer service.\n\nCheck-in is at 3pm and it is 6:02pm and still no room. They keep blaming housekeeping with very little remorse. Seriously? You're not apologizing for this inconvenience? \n\nI rate this 2 stars because there is a pool and the location is decent in relation to the dining and shopping we need to do. \n\nWould I stay here again? No. Would I recommend? No.  A hotel should accommodate it's paying guests with a room at the proper time. And if there is a wait, I expect a sincere apology at the least. \n\nHotel Omni is a fail, in my opinion."
1,"Everything is always great service, food, and atmosphere. My only complaint is I came back from vacation and my bartender Matt is not longer here. I won't be back as often now that he is gone."
0,"Native New Yorker is a fitting name as it smells like New York, on trash day, in August. There was a strong rotten egg smell wafting through the place every few minutes during our visit, and not one staff member mentioned or apologized for it. Also consistent with New York was the terrible service. We sat at the bar and it took FOREVER to get a second beer from the bartender. He was busy flirting with some middle aged soccer moms for so long that we had to yell and stop him to get a second drink. He didn't deserve the tip we gave him. Food was bland and mediocre at best, and we won't be back."
0,"When I stayed here (on official model business) with Rob E.:\n\n-was denied entrance to the pool because an old people swinger event was taking up the space AND denied entrance to the pool at their sister hotel\n-had my sunglasses and watch stolen by housekeeping\n-came back one evening to find that housekeeping had left my door wide open\n-was not allowed to get from my room to the front door because they had a \""club night\"" going on in the middle\n-had to be escorted by security in the end, because they didn't trust me not to skip off from my hotel room to the hotel bar (which is, apparently, a crime).\n\nThey offered me a free night, but I couldn't imagine ever using it. Just keeping it real!"
0,"Ate lunch here one time waiting for my car to get checked next door.  I can only say........Don't....just don't.  This place reminds me of one of the crappy Mexican places you find in the middle of Kansas or Missouri or something like that.  It's not good food....I'd rather go to Taco Bell across the street. We got Tacos Pastor and tostada and enchilada plate.  No flavor whatsoever.  No spice, no salt, stale chips, too much cinnamon in the horchata,  Service was fine...food no bueno."
1,"LOVE. I've been to the Wynn and Wicked Spoon buffets (albeit the Wicked Spoon for brunch not dinner) and the Bacchanal is the BEST hands down, but especially in the dessert area. We were seated at the large table overlooking the Roman Pools and the decor in the buffet is absolutely fresh and stunning. I've never been to a buffet that was able to do Chinese dim sum dishes properly, but the Bacchanal pulls it off. My only regret is that my stomach was not large enough to sample everything. I cannot wait to return. I pray to god that the quality stays the same."
1,"All the po boys are delicious, as are much of the sides. The red beans and rice is so-so, but the jambalaya is very tasty as well. Always stop by here for a bite if I'm in the area."
0,"Food was disappointing. I tried loading it up with the dry spices and the sauce at the end but it was a bit bland. Having the fresh meats side by side is a little disconcerting. Overall it wasn't bad food, but I've had much better at lower prices. I'm sure if I kept going I would figure out how to get a decent tasting meal, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort."
0,"We stopped for breakfast at this Mimi's on our way out of town and oh my... what a disappointment. I have been to Mimi's at Desert Ridge and Metrocenter, and they have been OK, but we would never come back to this one.\n\nThe food was very plain, the plate looked huge with just a few potatoes... My husband ordered hot tea and the cup they brought him was nasty. I understand some stains are hard to remove, but I did clean some smudges with my finger...\n\nWhen we brought it to the attention of our waitress, she behaved like, 'oh there are just coffee stains...' but still took it to replace it. \nSince no one brought another cup, we asked the person that brought our food, (yep, that is how long it took) and just then she was in her way to our table...\nShe even said it took her so long because she had to go 'hunt' for a clean cup...\nWhat kind of excuse is that?\n\nWe also had asked for crispy bacon, she even wrote it twice, and yet we got regular bacon. We sent it back and even after that it was not crispy at all...\nSo yeah, they didn't pass the crispy bacon test.\n\nOh well..."
1,This is a guys place. Sit down and talk about sports. Heck even the owner Tanya can hang in the conversation. Manny is who I go to and either one of them has the fade down to a science. Then you will enjoy a straight razor shave on your neck. This barber shop is reasonable and your cut will be on everytime. no hack jobs here I have been going to this shop for more than 5 years. Excellent
0,Food is ok the usual for Denny's but this one you need to look at the dishes. Almost every dish had dried food on them.
1,"A friend from out of town wanted to eat there so a group of us went here last night. When we got there there was a table open and we were seated immediately but there was a line outside while we were eating. The food was very good, everyone liked it. It was not the best I have ever eaten but still very good. The portions were not large but enough I didn't leave hungry either. Service was reasonable but not great. Considering this is a fairly small place and it was extremely busy I cannot complain. Overall it was a good experiance and we left happy."
1,"Was really really really busy on sunday for dim sum but still everything was sooooo good, expect the duck. If it wasn't for the duck I would have given the place 5 stars. I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings, noodles, and pork & corn dumplings. Great staff, friendly and reasonable price."
0,"Lobby bar bartenders are rude. Two bartenders ignored us for 5+ minutes. We tried to get they're attention and when they made eye contact with us, they made no sign that they had seen us. We finally just decided to leave. There is no excuse for rude service."
1,"I love the flavor combinations on all their food. Great food, conistent quality... Can be loud and busy in the evenings but great food for sure."
0,"This place is awful! Told the obnoxious attendant I only WANT A BASIC CARWASH 10 TIMES!!! Wanted to sell me \""future\"" services! Pulled out and went somewhere else."
1,"While Takara's d\u00e9cor won't wow you (looks kinda tacky 80s style) and they don't have the most creative sushi rolls, you can count on them to serve solid favorites every time.  Lunch time is buzzing and you will get a great deal from their bento boxes, which include both sushi rolls and other cooked foods.  The butterfly roll and the spicy tuna are our favorites."
1,"I loved the bargain rack, I got every Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz book for a dollar each.  They also comic books and records and a lot of books that you might not find at Barnes and Nobles or Borders."
1,"My wife & I dropped in for lunch as we stumbled upon Gaati while shopping at Trader Joe's. We both had Tom Kah Gai - coconut milk chicken soup with lemongrass for a starter. My wife had the spicy mint chicken and I had red chicken curry. Having spent months in Thailand, the flavors at Gaati are authentic and I share others opinions about prices. All in all, I recommend Gaati for genuine Thai cuisine, even though it's 20% higher in price. But other Thai restaurants don't match the flavors at Gaati. We'll return for another round and let you know."
0,"Bought a Living Social deal for myself and my sister and went in together this afternoon. Someone yelled to greet us when we walked in the door and I replied that we had the LS deal and were there for mani/pedis. A woman rushed over and literally whispered to me (so no other customers would hear about the LS?) that they only accept 5 LS appointments per day and were currently booked for weeks. Umm...probably something worth mentioning in the fine print of the voucher. \nObviously I would never purchase another Living Social deal from them, but based on their customer service (or lack of!) I also wouldn't bother to give them another try."
0,I was excited to try this place. Had the Calamari for an appetizer and was not impressed. It reminded me of fish sticks but calamari. Had a lot better! I had the high tide burger and it was a hamburger with king crab meat on top of the Pattie. The meat was cheap and very greasy. The bottom bun was soaked with the grease and the meat wasn't warm. I couldn't even eat half of the burger. I will not be coming back.
0,"I'm updating my previous review after staying at the hotel this past weekend for the 2nd time. After this 2nd stay I have a different opinion on this hotel. \n\nHere are the Pros: The hotel has a great location, a pool, mini fridge in room,free wifi, free public printer/computer and free parking. The room service breakfast was nothing to write home about, but it was brought up fast and the girl who delivered it was polite. The hotel overall is very clean which is a big plus!\n\nAnd now here are my Cons:\n-The hotel and the rooms are outdated for my taste, I guess their going for a colonial look to match the capitol, but some of the furniture has seen better days. \n\n-Had to take two separate elevators to any room above 7th floor\n\n-The front desk staff on a Saturday night could not be bothered to give me a number for a cab company, he told me to just stand outside in the cold. If the square wasn't blocked off for a marathon maybe I would have found one, ended up getting an Uber instead.\n\n-And now to my real beef of the weekend and why I most likely will bring my business elsewhere: The same front desk clerk was unenthusiastic when I asked him to look up the parking ticket I had accidentally left in the room. Eventually after a few eye rolls he looked into it. I thought this was nonsense because they mention to you as you check in that if you forget your ticket they can look it up for you! The night bellhop was equally unhelpful. I fully understand that a lost ticket is probably annoying, but I was literally the only guest around so these guys were not busy at all, they were just being straight rude and lazy. I tried to explain my key chains to the bellhop who seriously couldn't even be bothered to look. He told me to look for it, so I went into his station and looked at a huge wall of keys with no help from him. I was being extremely polite and tried to make small talk multiple times and he showed zero interest. Then because it is valet I had to be walked up to my car by the same rude guy just to get my coat.  Overall the whole experience with the night-staff made me feel like my $175 that I paid for a night wasn't worth jack to them."
0,"This place is overpriced. The steak sandwich had no flavor. The beef was tough and  tasteless. For $23 a sandwich I expected better. Some will say you have to pay at least $30 for a good steak, but I don't care. Good food is good food. If you are known for something, then you should do it well.\n\nThe Forbidden Broadway Sundae did not taste good. It was basically a bowl of fat.\n\nThe music was too loud too."
1,"I love local coffee shops and especially ones that stay open in the evenings.  I am always looking for a place to hang out and study or just chill and Talebu has been just that for me since it opened.  I appreciate their open room and the atmosphere and would recommend this place to anyone looking to meet with others or just hang out and read a book.  At times, the music does get loud but I've never complained to the workers so I don't know if they would lower the volume for me but I don't mind and I think they'd take note of it if I did complain. \n\nThe owner appears to work hard and truly care about not only her shop but the workers and patrons which is always a good thing! I have ordered both hot specialty coffee drinks and their smoothies and enjoyed both.  \n\nThank you Talebu!"
0,"Just watched new staff members put over 15 pairs of loaner skates away without disinfecting them. My daughter's been figure skating here for over a year.  Never had any issues until new ownership took over. The place is going downhill and needs a lot of revamping. New owner stopped free skate before practice,  lost my payment and places the figure skaters on the south pole ring (which is freezing has no arcade game or snack bar/tv to entertain restless siblings) while the north pole ring is completely vacant. Hopefully this is just some growing pain and will improve with time. Until then, my daughter will be finding another hobby."
1,I really enjoyed the intimate setting. Great service:)
1,"Ate there Monday and it was fabulous. Great room, inventive menu an good wine list. I had the pepper crusted filet. Service was friendly and very attentive.  So good. I definitely recommend."
1,"I have been getting Rony's scissor cut for the past seven years. I have difficult, thick, kinky/curly hair and he knows how to make sure it looks good- immediately after the cut, and when it fills in too. In addition to a great cut, it is a pleasant break to talk and joke with Rony while in his chair. Finally, he has his own place! His prices are more competitive than in his past shops and and he still gives the best scissor cut in the valley. Shoulder massage and hot/cold towel, and rinse too, if you want."
1,"Acacia Demonstration Gardens is a beautiful garden spot in the shadow of the Henderson Spaghetti Bowl and the Horizon Ridge Parkway residential communities in the foothills of Black Mountain*. When you are driving on eastbound I-215 onto Southbound US 93/95/I-515 and are picking up speed to merge, you are driving above Acacia Demonstration Gardens which would be on your right. \n\n Acacia Demonstration Gardens is a 16 acre parkland of gardens and recreation. The gardens toward the east of the park occupy approximately four acres. First I'll talk about the gardens. Acacia is a demonstration garden because its mission is to demonstrate the kinds of trees, flowers, and plants that can survive in the heated climate of the Mojave Desert. The gardens are themed exhibits with informative signs that introduce the public to the horticulture and fauna of the Mojave Desert. The gardens include an Allergy Friendly Garden, Cactus Garden, Wildlife Friendly Garden, and Mediterranean Garden. These are pockets of Tranquility to sit on a bench and breath in the clean aroma of the plants. The plants include the Joshua Tree, beavertail cactus, quail Bush, and dwarf pomegranate. \n\n A TIP: The Allergy Friendly Garden COULD be the most allergy free and nicest smelling spot in the Las Vegas Valley. Sitting here was a five star aroma therapy session . And sitting here I LEARNED that the creosote bush is the ultimate Bush for a sneeze free yard. I also learned from my research  that the plants that smell like bubble gum are Mountain Laurels. \n\n Acacia Demonstration Gardens is also the home to some adorable critters. In the wash I have laid eyes on antelope squirrels and rabbits. \n\n Acacia Demonstration is a remonstration of the stereotype that freeways destroy neighborhoods. From the gardens and recreation areas, the Henderson Spaghetti Bowl towers above the parkland as a work of modernism art. \n\n Now I will talk about the remainder of the park. Between the recreation fields and playgrounds are the two dog parks. To the west of the dog parks are the green spaces of a soccer field, baseball field, and playground. Foot trails, benches, and picnic tables are interspersed throughout the park. \n\n  The last thing I want to say is that Acacia Demonstration Gardens is a jewel in the Henderson paved trail system. The Union Pacific Trail feeds into the park from the east and the Beltway Trail feeds into it from the west. These are first-rate trails. You can park at Acacia Trail then use the Union Pacific Trail that reaches just southwest of Railroad Pass to get near the Fiesta, Downtown Henderson, the stores at College and Horizon, and Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area. Or you can use the Beltway Trail to reach Stephanie Street that leads to Cornerstone Park on the north side of I-215.\n\n  I have been to Acacia Demonstration Gardens several times since I moved here in 2004. It has usually been a stop on the hikes that I did on the Union Pacific  and Beltway Trails. It has also been a garden spot where I chose to relax and breath in nature's aroma therapy. I  also spent time here during the year that I lived nextstore in Black Mountain Villas. \n  Acacia Demonstration Gardens is in bloom 365 days of year. This review has been a demonstration of why Acacia Demonstration Gardens is a tranquil garden spot that will bloom up your day. \n\n\n\n*This is a different Black Mountain than the one east of Anthem."
0,"it's been a while since the one and only time i went here, but it deserves a review, simply because of what happened there.\n\nwe were well on our way to having a hang over the next day, which seems like the only way to go to this bar. \n\nwe walked in (group of 6), and managed to find a table, inside, where the karaoke was happening. we're not that into karaoke, but it is free entertainment.\n\nas soon as we sat down, a woman started singing. she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser. then it happened.\n\nsome dude, about 5'2\"" gets up on stage, and starts dancing at her, while she's singing. i say at, because she was not dancing. no one was. except this guy, who was also in his mid-40s and sporting a sweet comb-over. it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank, like we were being taped for a surprise tv show. \n\nwe all sat there looking at each other, then looking at him, then back at each other. the lady was a trooper, she just kept singing. finally, the song was over, and he opened his arms up, like he was going to hug her. finally, some other guy from the audience, pulled him away, back down to his seat. very awkwardly. \n\nthat's not why i'm giving this 2 starts. we were there a good 15 minutes total, and never saw a server. more beer might have saved the situation, in some way. with no beer in sight, we bolted. we couldn't handle another episode like that, with nothing to wash it down with."
1,"Good choice if you are looking for a pricier Italian menu. They feature veal entrees and a pretty good assortment of Italian seafood dishes. Their homemade gnocchi and cavatelli are wonderful as well. The service is typically so-so, but the great food keeps me coming back."
0,"Place is OK\nLarge menu borders on pho, soups , chow meins\n-mussels in basil -ok...nothing special \n-chefs spicy chicken...ok...not spicy really...just a bunch of pepper pods\n-beef chow fun...like beef stroganoff in gravy Chinese style\n...looking around almost everyone was having soups so maybe that is their forte?"
1,"Ate here yesterday, had some good lunch at good $$. Saw my friend that works here, made some good business calls, talk business with my friend.\nFree Wi-Fi is always nice. \nHad a good and productive hour.\nI like Sir Hobos.\nI will come back."
1,This place is the best Chinese food in Madison!
1,"This is an update on my earlier [scathing] review of the service provided by Steenbock's.  \n\nTurns out, we must have hit the front of house staff on a *really* bad day: after I wrote my review, my partner was contacted about the mix-up and the situation was sorted.  We shared a lovely dinner at the restaurant tonight.\n\nThe service was attentive, but not overwhelming; the food was creative, delicious, and lovingly presented.  From the amuse-bouche, to the desserts we were thoroughly impressed.  \n\nWe opted for the chef's four course tasting menu (I had tuna-risotto-cod-carrot cake; my partner had oysters-lobster-scallops-chocolate), with the favorites being the miso cod on my menu, and the lobster on my partner's.   The miso cod had an intense earthy-savoury tang that was nicely balanced by the smooth, moist, and nicely flakey cod.  I'm not a lobster-person, but my partner demolished it in short order with conversation grinding to a halt as she ate.  \n\nPerhaps the only disappointment was the espresso - though, other than a few places in Madison (Bradbury's, The Victory) it's tough to get a solid espresso, and after the perfectly spicy-sweet-airy carrot cake I wasn't too fussed.  \n\nI think it certain we'll go back - and we're both very glad that we didn't write-off the restaurant after our first experience."
1,"My fianc\u00e9 and I have loved Sammy's and me in particular since they have great gluten free pizzas but when I decided to throw a surprise party there, they really blew me away with how helpful they were. I had to plan the party from the other side of the world  since I am deployed and their GM Julie was so incredibly helpful. They allowed me to pre order the food and pay for it as well as write a special message on a pizza for me! The let my friend drop off a cake a couple hours before the dinner and stored it for us. Everyone who came to the party said it was a wonderful experience and I know that is because of the great staff that works here!!  I cannot wait to get home and  have some Sammy's pizza!! (And the amazing quinoa salad)"

0,"OK it's official.  I don't like the Cheesecake Factory.  I've tried it a few times, and I'm not a chain snob.  Bring me some Bertucci's and I'm happy.  But here?  No.  Just no.  I don't get it.\n\nThe food is utterly mediocre (I suppose what does one expect, from a *factory*), and personally I find the portions an affront to good taste.  They are disgusting!  It's like a trough.  Anyone who can eat a whole plate of their food in one sitting needs to get help.  It's also waaaay overpriced.  I guess you're paying for quantity, not quality?  I mean you get enough food to feed yourself for a week.\n\nThe decor is so confused and charmless.  I feel like I'm on an acid trip when I'm in there--an acid trip that's gone very, very wrong and you've forgotten that life isn't a Lewis Carroll-ian hellscape.\n\nOne extra star for good service and good cheesecake.  But overall I can definitively say I won't be back to this particularly wretched chain."
1,5 star service. We must have had about 5 people waiting on us at all time. RANDY was the best server I have had in a very long time. TOP NOTCH. The $69 filet is worth every penny. The bison was delicious and I love the server who helped us order a bottle of wine. I'd go back in a heartbeat! It is absolutely beautiful inside! Loved sitting in the lounge after dinner.
0,"We were so hoping the next door Health Food store was associated with this cafe.  Came for Sunday lunch during an educational course located nearby, so options were limited.\n\nOpened the door and received a potent blast of greasy meat smells that set me (omnivore) and my dining partner (vegetarian) running for the door.  To the patio seating.  Thank good they had a good spinach salad. Generous with sliced hard boiled egg.  Mine had one whole slice of well done bacon on top."
0,"Thoroughly disappointed in the quality of food and service at Wonder Bar. I had the salmon special and the seafood was not fresh, I think I would have preferred the seafood at Red Lobster over Wonder Bar. When I told the server that I was disappointed in the quality of food, he nonchalantly shrugged. If you're looking for seafood, go down the street to Sardine....the food is exceptional."
1,"I absolutely love the 2 bedroom loft apartment with the character of the exposed beams, brick, concrete floors, and amazing natural light. But here's what you may not see on your tour and find once you move in: trains coming and going at all hours of the day and night. I don't just mean you may be inconvenienced by the road being closed for a train to cross through, I mean loud, ceaseless honking as the train crosses the road right behind the complex. Also, storage is at a premium as there are no drawers in the bathrooms and only under sink cabinets and small closets. \n\nThe management staff has been great with all my interactions with them and the valet trash is a nice change since I've never had it before. The walls and windows are really thin though and you can hear everyone walking by outside, especially late at night after a Panthers game. The new Lynx stop is going in right next door and expected to open December 2015 which will make this a much more attractive area and hopefully bring some more walkable attractions. While 7th street market isn't too far, it'd be nice to have some walkable amenities. \n\nI love the apartment itself, but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of the surrounding area and noise control."
1,"I toke my phone here because the day I got it I dropped it and it had a little crack on it that drove me kraZy, instead of looking at the little crack for the next year I decided to get it fixed. Searched yelp and this place seemed to have good prices everywhere else said over one hundred dollars. So I check the prices online and it said glass 6.99 and nothing listed on there price list was over 100 dollars so I toke it there a bit of a drive but prices seemed wroth it. When I got there the employee ( who was very nice) said 125 I was confused that was way more than any price listed on there website but since I already drive all the way there I decided to go through with it but I have to admit I felt like the website lied to me. So he quoted me 40 min I mentioned the yelp deal and be knocked off 20 bucks. I waited about 10-15 min and it was done . They offered me a free screen protector and installed it for me which was great! Four stars because employees where nice and service was fast , but I have no idea why the website lists completely different prices than they charged me ."
1,Hope to go tonight and see the new menu and the new location.  It's going to be great and we can't wait!  Congratulations on the move to Baseline Rd in Mesa.  Tons more space.  Wishing you all much success on your next first day.
0,"My wife and i decided to take advantage of the timeshare introduction \""deal\"". We paid $199 for 3 nights here, and were to get our $199 returned to us after the \""2 hour\"" sales pitch. \nThe place was nice, the staff very friendly. Decent room (No elevators though). \nThen came the timeshare pitch. \nWe were assigned a very nice lady rep (\""Kimber\""). She was very thorough, but it was so obvious of the brainwashing training that they receive. The timeshare price went from about $42.000.00 down to $11,000.00. They make it sound like such a great deal......they all tour these reconditioned rooms and tell you that they can \""make you a special deal just for you\"".Very funny. \nAfter 2 1//2 hours, we wouldn't budge. I told her that I do not buy ANYTHING in one day, not even a pair of shoes. They try harder to get a commitment, because now that you know what they offer, you can easily look up reviews. (and I did).\nOnce Kimber gave up, a guy named \""Tom\"" came over with a huge smile. He offered us a 24 month packaged vacation, no interest payments of $69.00/month. He promised that our $11,000 offer would be extended for these 24 months if we bought this vacation package. i asked to look at the contract, he happily retrieved one. \nI looked at it, it had his 24 month package on there as he explained it, but it also had the other deal at $19,000.00, not the $11,000.00 that we spoke of. I challenged him on it, he said that this was a general form from Florida. I told him to modify it and add the $11,000.00 agreement, he said \""i cannot do that\"". When I said \""no deal then\"", he became angry and acted like a spoiled child. Really, I was embarrassed for him the way he acted in front of my wife. He turned red in the face, stood up rapidly bundling his paperwork and said \""I don't have time for this, follow the hallway and get your money\"". \nWhat a jack ass. In fact, they are all jack asses. Don't do it. Look up airbnb.com and see the many options for great vacations without cheating commitments. \nLook at the reviews from their own employees on ripoffreport.com, or even glassdoor.com. They screw and lie to their own employees. Hell, many poor suckers who regret buying these timeshares are selling them for pennies on the dollar to get out of it. \nAgain, the hotel was decent, but a timeshare pitch is a timeshare pitch. I would do it again to get another free vacation, as I never fool for these and enjoy wasting their time and pissing them off."
1,"The room is gorgeous.  The food is extremely varied and everything we ate was pretty damn good.  That being said, I was a bit disappointed in the sushi selection, which consisted entirely of about three rolls and one salmon sushi.  The rolls were very basic and were mostly rice.   I would focus on the meats, salads and seafood (ceviche, poke, crab legs).   If you like tapas-type dishes, you will like this buffet.  The desserts, by the way, were incredible, so leave some room!"
0,"I had the same problem as other people. I got a coupon off of restaurants.com to get a free $25 even after the free $25 I still had to pay $60 which is crazy because thats really expensive for food. The ordering is at the counter and then you sit down to eat so 18% gratuity is a little outrageous. Also, it said on the coupon that drinks could not make your minimum order, however, the gratuity is added after your drinks. \n\nBesides the whole money issue the sushi wasn't even that good. I didn't care for the food regardless of the price. I will not go back to this place."
0,"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery using a coupon. The driver was great but the coupon was not applied to our bill (the person who took our order never verfied the total when he took our order). When we called to have this fixed they offered to credit us the difference for our next visit- which was not helpful because we don't eat there often. When they finally offered to refund our money and we started eating our garlic knots were completely raw inside, the wings weren't good, and our pizza was mostly sauce. We didn't bother calling to let them know that our food was raw because they probably would have offered us free food in the future and we have no plans to eat there again. ever."
0,"The smoke,  can't escape it in Pittsburgh. This bar was a little scary. Not the bartender or its patrons but the bar it's self was scary."
1,"SO good - this was one of my favorite spots that I got to try in Vegas.  Simple, but dangerously delicious sandwiches.  The Full Montague was SO delicious.  Highly recommend it.  Also, their mac 'n cheese side was very good.\n\nNot to mention, this place is SUPER affordable... definitely a great deal when you are on the strip!"
1,A true 5 star resort with amazing amenities. The suite was huge and the resort fee covered the gym and internet. Lots of dining options and great service at the concierge and all throughout. Encore is connected to Wynn so you get the best of both casinos. Rooms were super clean and very modern and new. Awesome experience!
0,"This place is OK if you haven't had REAL Thai food. Its always interesting to me when a Thai food place serves something like orange chicken because that is neither Thai nor is it an even an authentic Chinese dish. I have been to Thialand, I am asian, I have had a lot of home cooked Thai dishes, and I LOVE Thai food. \n\nI've lived in LA, SF, NY and Seattle where Thai food is everywhere and for the most part good. This place is somewhere I would only find at least an hour away from the city. No real spice unless you ask for it, most Thai food it comes standard. They didn't even give us an option until we asked. Bland at best, but I'm sure there's worse. Will NOT come back, that's for sure. I would best describe this place as americanized Thai food. Good for people who aren't THAT adventurous, but like something a little different, just like most \""ethnic\"" food you would finding Anthem."
1,"Always a good staple in the community for groceries. If you like fresh and quality, this is your place to shop. \n\nNow closer to my side of town, in and out convience for parking, however, (not during the up coming holiday season as I am sure this place will be crowded!) it will be more of a quick trip for me now. \n\nI can always find something new to try, today we're trying their mac n cheese, heard it was suppose to be good. Also picked up some can delights for my fur balls, they always enjoy a little pate for dinner. \n\nClean, friendly staff, knows their stuff, very helpful!"
1,"Passed by The Fudge House while strolling along the Royal Mile & couldn't resist....I mean, come on! Fudge, right?! \n\nOffering soft fudge & hard alike, this place can cater to the pickiest fudge connoisseur & I for one, am awfully picky \n\nI prefer the softer fudge while my parents opt for the hard & we both found multiple flavor combinations we deemed worthy \n\nSuper nice staff answered all our questions about flavors & consistencies & she helped direct us to our soft / harder sides accordingly so we'd have an easier time making our choices \n\nAnd those choices weren't easy b/c there was SO much deliciousness! \n\nWe tried a bit all over the range, from Double Chocolate, to Maple, to Butterscotch - plain & some w/ nuts, we didn't have a morsel we didn't like \n\nPrices were extremely reasonable (esp for being on the Mile) \n\nDefinite fans here!"
0,My boyfriend and I were really excited to try this place and it turned out to be a huge let down. I ordered chicken parm and my boyfriend ordered spaghetti and meatballs and it literally came out within 5 mins of ordering it. So was it just reheated? Our waiter was horrible and never could be found. My chicken was so rubbery I couldn't eat it. The meatballs were very small and it just overall was not a good experience.
0,"Your not being truthful now Ross. We watched you question nobody after us!!!!   As mid age business men not young concert goers, your excuses match your arrogance. Your style and energy are poor examples of how a business should be run. Hospitality is obviously not your strength.  Cool space, weak selective service and excuses!! Bitter and Selective!!!! Good luck in the future"

I packed nothing but dresses and heels. Why I did not pack walking shoes I'll never know.\n\nBigD lives in Los Angeles/Inglewood.  We met in Cortina, Italy on a trip with the National Brotherhood of Skiers. He is a Snowboarder. After hooking up we decieded to have a long distance thang. This was just one of our meetings.\n\nHis birthday is in July....so this was a party and meetup all in one.\nI called myself researching this hotel. He loves water, hot tubs so...I was looking for a room like that on the strip. I checked eOpinions, Travelocity, AccessVegas.com.  The IP got decent reviews. A few scary ones i should have paid attention to.  Caveat Emptor......  Buyer Beware.\n\nI am no newbie to hotels either.....  Here is some 411 on the IP\n\nImperial Palace is a 2,640 room hotel and a 75,000 square foot (7,000 m) casino located on the famed Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The hotel and casino were owned by Imperial Palace LLC until purchased by the current owner, Harrah's Imperial Palace Corporation a subsidiary of Harrah's Entertainment.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1979 the property was called the Flamingo Capri. In 1979, it was renamed to the Asian-themed Imperial Palace by new owner Ralph Engelstad. When Ralph died in 2002, the casino ownership transferred to the Ralph Engelstad and Betty Engelstad Trust. The casino operated as its own limited partnership, Imperial Palace LLC, under the Trust's oversight.\n\nUnderwent a major renovation in 1988 which added an 18-story tower.\n\nOn August 22, 2005, Harrah's announced plans to purchase this property. The acquisition was completed on December 23, 2005.\n\nDuring a conference call with investors on November 20, 2005, the Chairman for Harrah's, Gary Loveman, did not surprise industry analysts when he said that both the Imperial Palace and neighboring O'Sheas \""are going to require very substantial modifications or complete tear-downs and rebuilds\"" in order to make room for a Harrah's and/or Flamingo expansion on the Strip. \n\nAddress  3535 Las Vegas Blvd South\nLas Vegas, NV 89109\nOpening date  1979\nPrevious names  Flamingo Capri, Best Western Imperial Palace\nCasino type  Land-Based\nTheme  Chinese/Asian\nOwner  Harrah's Imperial Palace Corporation\nNo. of rooms  2,640\nTotal gaming space  75,000 ft (7,000 m)\nPermanent shows  Legends in Concert\nSignature attractions  The Auto Collections\nNotable restaurants  Embers\nMing\nFireside\nCockeyed Clam\nYears renovated  1988 New tower\nWebsite  imperialpalace.com\n\nA Roach...and not the 420 kind ran across my toiletry kit...YUCK..\nThe Comp package of Champange and chocolate dipped strawberries was laughable.

0,"I understand that this place is an old classic, but it seems more old than classic at this point.  It just feels dirty inside, the food is medium quality at very best and the service struggles.  They try hard, but it looks like the staff is on their own.  Probably my last visit unless there is a serious change."
0,Service flat out sucked! Their waitresses were all sitting around or making themselves drinks while we waited to put our orders in for over 10 minutes(there were only 3 other groups). When we finally got our food it was undercooked and cold.
0,"This waiting room is by far the worst I've ever been to. Staff is rude and has attitude, personal questions are asked loudly (social security, personal information). I even heard staff ask a young woman loudly if she's ever had any abortions or miscarriages. Waiting times are extremely long. Charged 150 for a consultation to show the doctor results I already knew the recommendation for....\nHorrible experience.\nNever ever ever go to Becky Gonzales. How she completed medical school I don't know-she gave me incorrect information and was rude. No bedside manner. \nSwitched to dr knapp-so far other than the aforementioned she has been ok."
0,"This was one of my early favorites when I first started living here two years ago.  I love their chips and hot sauce.  Some of the best in Phoenix.  Last two visits really missed the boat.  This last time the service was so bad that I had to chase my waiter down just to get my order delivered correctly.\n\nFood is pretty good.  Love the Baja Burro.  But, two less than great service experiences--I won't be back."
0,"First of all, I have to point out that I am highly concerned that there are four \""hidden\"" reviews for this place, all of which are negative but not \""reccommended\"". Funny, how all the visible reviews are good, so it gives them a higher rating...? I wonder if my two-star review will become \""hidden\"" as well...? None of those reviews are inappropriate - they're honest. I think someone may be flagging them to hide them, which is not cool folks.\n\nOkay, so here's what I have to say. This place has amazing equipment and technology. Three years ago, I came here and was astounded - another eye doctor had tried telling me my eyes hadn't changed, but yet everything was fuzzy, I KNEW my eyes had changed. I came here to Sharper Vision and yes, they had proper equipment and with my new glasses, I could see again!! It was wonderful. I even recommended this place to my mother and grandmother. The eyeglasses selection is... on the minimal side, but I liked what they had, so I didn't mind. \n\nLately, though, the service has taken a turn, and not for the better. My last visit, I tried talking to the doctor about my eye muscles fluttering constantly in one eye, and he dismissed it. New glasses helped, but I still have this issue. I was also frustrated because their eyeglass selection has just gotten ridiculous. Hey, you want uber-trendy frames? This is the place to go. Fendi, Vogue, Juicy, oh, they got it. You'll pay upward of $500 for the frames alone, but they got it. You want reasonably priced simple frames? Eh... you might not be happy with what they have. Frankly, I didn't like the shape of the glasses I got, but they were all I could afford. Everything else was high-end brand names and too pricey. Unless, that is, I wanted huge granny-glasses or aviator styles that look straight out of the eighties. Yeah, they have those, too. Seriously, I think they stock those so that the beautiful $550 Fendi frames that compliment your eyes will suddenly look worth the cost.\n\nNow, I've been trying to get in to see the doctor again. My eye muscles are fluttering horribly, interrupting my sleep and my work, AND I'm planning a major vacation in about three weeks. I've been trying to get in to see someone for a month now, and they're always full.\n\nBut its not just that. When I call in, the office staff is horrible (hence why I'm pointing out those \""hidden\"" reviews, as they all mention the rudeness of the staff) and absolutely unhelpful. I call in and rather than trying to help me find an open appointment, I'm told every day they're filled up. Seriously? Every single slot filled for the next two weeks?? Not one opening??? What, is this eye-season or something?\n\nSo... I don't know what's going on. I don't know why they're hiding all the negative reviews here, I don't know why the staff is suddenly not being very helpful, and I don't know why it now costs nearly double to get glasses than it did my first time in. I still have respect for this place and their doctors... but I don't have the time to wait for them now, and I can't afford them. It makes me sad."
0,"Vegetarian, don't get a \""vegetarian filling\"" burrito, its filled with only beans and rice then lettuce on side. The  menu says guacomole but youll get charged $2 extra for it. Get salad instead!! Les s room for error and more bang for your bucks."
1,"Best pizza to date in Vegas. The Sicilian was unreal! Came with salad for 2 and slices of garlic bread for $18!!!! Are you kidding me?!?!?  Sara L that rated it a 1, pull the stick out and go back to Olive Garden where you belong."
0,"Worst service EVERRRRRR!!!! Great food and all, but sooo disrespectful!!!! I could of went to McDonald's and got a better service!\n\nRSVP for 8:30pm, got our seat around 8:40. Our waiter came at 9, to take our order. Started with \""what can I get you guys,\"" but before we ordered, we had questions because its our first time here. But he looked like he didn't want to be at our table. More like he wanted to be at his other tables aka rich people tables. We look very young, celebrating our 1st year anniversary, maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him as much as those \""other people\"". We are still customer, show us some respect will you!!! \n\nso continuing, I asked about this certain dish that has salmon in it. it was called \"" salmon de ...something\"", but when I asked about it, he replied \""you don't know what a salmon is?\"" SERIOUSLY, WOW great job Sherlock. of course, I know what a salmon is, but what's the dish about. is it...cooked, grilled, fried, seared, what!?!?!?! \n\n*CLANK* So ordering is done. So my GF and I were talking while we were waiting for our food to come. And here comes our waiter out of no where with these metal bowls for our discarding shells, but he threw it on out table making this loud clanking noise. *CLANK*!!! no sorry, or excuse me, just \""here are these for your shells.\"" \n\nJust wanted a fancy dinner and celebrate our 1 year!!! I did not wanted this kind of experience on our special day!!!"
1,"Henry's Cellar is small. But not in a cramped, stuffy kind of way. In a cosey, intimate kind of way! Meaning it's perfect for gigs!\n\nThis review might be a little different because I was on the stage. When my band play gigs I like to see the audience and gauge their reaction/rate their dance moves! So Henry's cellar is perfect in that sense and allows the audience to get up close and personal to the band. \n\nThe resident sound engineer was the best we've ever had! So helpful and accommodating. And the music from the DJ in the gap between bands was bang on! Suited perfectly to the theme of the night. - 1920s jazz!\n\nWatching the other bands play and playing myself, I felt like Henry's Cellar is a worthy venue in Edinburgh's music scene and nightlife! Although, it's best to check out the bands playing before you go because entry to gigs can be a little pricey. But I'd say it's worth it based on the quality of the performers!"
1,"My wife and I just ate here last night and loved it.  Everything here is made fresh and with care--true authentic Burmese home cooking.  I enjoyed it so much I returned today and ordered their fish curry with salmon.  Again, I truly enjoyed it.  I will definitely be back often."
1,Can't believe it took me 2 years to try this restaurant. Went last night and had the best food and service. Loved the homemade biscuits with cinnamon butter. I had the tri tip sandwich and it was delicious. Husband had the brisket which was also good. Can't go wrong with a place that serves their beverages in a mason jar - the strawberry lemonade hit the spot.
1,"My husband has been asking to eat at Bobby Q since we moved into our house in the north valley about 8 months ago.  We finally got around to it on his birthday last week.  On first entering, I felt like I was in a BBQ joint in Austin, TX.  The atmosphere was so Texan and down-home I might as well have been in Austin.  I ordered the special drink of the day, an adult Arnold Palmer.  One word:  AMAZING.  The lemonade they used really put it over the top.  So fresh and tart!  Everyone at our table was pleased with the abundance of meat and side items they received.  The icing on the cake was definitely the freshly fried mini cinnamon and sugar donuts they give you before you leave.  It's little touches like that that will beckon us to eat here again and again."
0,I do not recommend this place AT ALL!  It honestly tastes like an extremely over priced microwaveable dinner. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare. There was absolutely no taste to anything. Maybe the chef forgot all the spices. The vegetables tasted like they came from a can. My filet was also over cooked to a well done. There was no juicy pink center. Very unhappy.
1,"They are one of my favorite chinese restaurant. The owners are extremely friendly, i usually phone in to pre order the live lobster, it is the best dish i ever have in vegas! I dont know why there are so many bad reviews here, their other spicy dishes are just as good as yunnan garden."
0,"Long wait for substandard overpriced food.  Saved a lunch just to try them out, particularly their lobster roll.  The lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche bread, not a roll, which just doesn't taste right and is horrible.  The lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery, to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.  The bread is coated with butter and pan fried which produces an oily, sloppy mess.  It's a failure sandwich of disappointment.\n\nAlso tried the lobster chowder in the bread bowl, which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.  My friend ordered the shrimp po boy, which was bad as well.  The shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not good at all.  Why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the bread roll I'll never know (we did ask, the chef refused).  \n\nThe sandwiches come with fries or coleslaw and you can \""combo\"" it for $6 which means add a drink. WTH?  If it comes with fries anyway aren't you just paying $6 for a drink then?  Better strategy would be to go to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.  I ordered a coleslaw because my friend went with fries and got fries anyway.  After the 20 min wait for the food I didn't want to go back and exchange.\n\nBottom line: walk across the street to Planet Hollywood's LobsterMe instead for good lobster roll."
0,"I wish I could rate in negative numbers.  This doctor is a waste of space.  I went in for stomach pain.  After giving me a diagnosis, he did not prescribe anything for the pain.  So what was the need to get all of the tests run?  Was it to get money from my insurance company?  I thought that was the biggest waste of time and money.  He is rude and condescending.  Instead of a positive approach, he chose the negative when asking me about my pain.  There are two ways of saying the same thing, Buddy.  You may want to retake the class in bedside manner.  Do not see this doctor!  He has checked out mentally."
1,"This place was a lot of fun - relaxed atmosphere, great food, and great wine.  We ordered the wine of the month for March, which was a Neprica, and immediately afterward had to look up where we could buy it back home.\n\nI had the meat rustico, which I would definitely order again.  This was one of my favorite meals while we were visiting Scottsdale."
1,I love how one review of this place was deducted stars cause people were smoking outside.  Duh!  It's a bar in Tempe.  People have a tendency to smoke while drinking at a concert.  Get over it!\n\nI love this place.  I've been twice on Thursday night to see this amazing Grateful Dead cover band called Xtra Ticket.  They play there every Thursday night at 9:10pm.  \n\nWhat's great is before 9:10pm drinks are two for one.  Usually we stock up.  The sound is AMAZING here.  AMAZING.  The staff has always been more than nice.  Typically going out of their way to be friendly.  \n\nDrinks are cheap.  Good beer for cheap = winner!
0,"Horrible!\nI didnt have time to drive to my usual place, so i end up here. \nWoman who was doing my nails was inexperienced and slow.\nFirst she burned my toe trying to massage it with the hot stone! \nThen she cut my me. When i asked her to put some sanitizer on it, she got angry, started arguing with me that is not necassary and made a comment in Vietnamese language to another employee working next to her....Really? You gonna talk crap in foreighn language right in front of me? They should not be allowed to speak any other language than English in front of customers on a first place, its disrespectful!\nI asked for the french pedicure, she couldnt get the white tip to look nice, had to redo it a few times. The pedicure alone took 2 hours!\nI refused to let her do my manicure. The other person who did my manicure was decent, but my mood was completely ruined.\nI adressed my dissapointment to the guy who seemed to be in charge. He said he could redo my pedicure (after i spent so much time here already....no, thank you), but did not even apologized.\nIn addition this place is pricey.\nWouldnt recommend to anybody!"
0,"My husband and I went there last Saturday evening. We were 1 of 2 tables occupied, so we were a little nervous. Why wasn't this so called great place busy on a Saturday night?  Well, we found out. \n\nThe lone person on the floor was a nice enough person, just needs some training. She was the hostess, busser, and waitress. She spent a lot of time in the kitchen area so when we needed something it was difficult to find her. It was obvious her dinner was in the back since she came out eating several times.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable pajun only to receive the one with shrimp in it. Luckily my husband could smell the shrimp and saw them quickly since I am allergic! It took a few minutes to find our waitress since she was in the back again, but she apologized and made us another one and served it with our dinner instead of before our meal. Then we received our meal. We shared the Bimbimbap with chicken. Blah and bland. The rice was under cooked and the chicken was not seasoned and extremely dry. We added a lot of hot sauce and soy sauce to get some flavor, but it was hard to get over the \""chewey\"" texture. The pajun that we had ordered was fine. A bit under cooked and runny, but fine in taste.\n\nAfter a LONG wait for our waitress we got our check. We were quite surprised that the pajun was not comped. I didn't complain, just took mental note of another misstep in bad service. \n\nIf you want really good Bimbimbap, go to Graze on the square. That place knows what it's doing! This was not worth it."
1,"Absolutely loved going there. The food was awesome, the waiter was funny, and the atmosphere was very cool. We heard great stories about the clubs hay day. We also heard about the ghost that haunts the club. I would highly recommend going there. Don't be surprised if your food comes out in shifts because the kitchen is small and they want to get the food right. It's well worth the wait. If you do go ask, to have Joe as your waiter he is a riot. He looks like an Elvis impersonator, side burns and all. This was my first trip to Vegas, and when I go back this will defiantly be a stop."
1,"I am a Starbucks fanatic and I visit at least one Starbucks location a day.  I know many Baristas and I also know they move from location to location quite a bit.  With all that being said, my favorite Starbucks location, today, is the Lake Mead/Buffalo location.\n\nThe staff is competent, cordial, and extremely efficient.  It is one of the busiest locations in North West Las Vegas but they are always able to get you your drink quickly.  \n\nIt is equipped with a drivethru and a rather large out door seating area.   The indoor seating is usually crouded and not the best for large groups.  There are always patrons sitting down in this location which tells you nothing but good things about the location."
0,"Undoubtedly the ghastliiest food experience we have ever endured. My wife and I are very seasoned travelers, i am English and work on cruise ships across the globe, 50 weeks a year. We are also food adventurers and eat in some the oddest places, especially in the Far East. But this was utterly abysmal. Chicken and beef fajitas that had past their sell by date at least 2 days prior - stale chips, guacamole the strangest shade of khaki and salsa which resembled something that had been meticulously scraped from the bottom of a parrot cage. We paid begrudgingly only because the waitress was so attentive (mostly to distract us from what's as languishing on our plates). The following day, today, I have even had a bad stomach. My wife phoned the manager this afternoon, not looking for recompense or a free meal (god forbid) but merely to point out how poor the food was, and was curtly informed that it was our fault because we didn't complain enough at the time! This is truly the Mexican Fawlty Towers and not quite so funny either. If you are considering eating here, I would avoid this place like hemerrhoids.\nBy the way, avoid the churros like Ebola. I was still chewing the wretched thing 15 minutes after leaving the restaurant."
0,"They charge 12.95 for a basic car wash, but they sure don't know what a car wash means. I  thought I was getting a great job done cause it took over 35 minutes, but I was wrong.    They did a poor job vacuuming(still have noticeable pieces on the carpet), and they didn't wipe down all surfaces, And they were not that busy. You would think when they are not busy they would do there best. They need to concentrate on clean as much as there sales people try to get you to up grade you level of car wash."
0,"Dairy Queens are plentiful and I've been to hundreds of them, from state to state. Most of them have problems with cleanliness and staff, though occasionally you'll find an awesome one that is run with care. Despite their track record, there are some base expectations that need to be met when you go to a place like this. It's nothing major really. If you can grab some ice cream and not be disgusted or angry by the time you leave, you're usually alright.\n\nThis location couldn't even accomplish the basics. Five high school girls were working the place, could not care less about their menial jobs, with no management presence to speak of. While they talked, handled money, and used the phone, a 10 year old that didn't work there was making all the orders. She looked confused and overwhelmed as a line of customers were filing through. The actual employees? Not doing much.\n\n22 minutes to get a blizzard. Twenty-two. I'd never waited so long for ice cream in my life. Wasn't made properly at all, so the taste was sullied as well. That's why I'm taking the time to write a review of a _Dairy Queen_. Boo this location."
0,"Important note - we are both vegetarian.\n\nI mention this because the focus is obviously on meat, which may be great, but any good restaurant can cook their veggies.  We go to four and five diamond restaurants often and are overall pretty easy.\n\nWhile they were accomodating to us, what we got was a mediocre salad, a platter of roasted vegetables, and a veggie pasta.  These are the most obvious items, which unfortunately were only poorly executed.  \n\nThe ambiance is beautiful, but very casual.    Great for kids - not the best for a romantic dinner.  It felt like a very high end Olive Garden to us.  Loud, many large tables, good decor - overall solid.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am more critical here because of how many amazing Vegas restaurants there are.  The convenience to shopping is wonderful, as well as the decor, but the creativity and overall execution was poor."
1,"Food was excellent! The servers stayed up on keeping our drinks filled up! Only problem I have with this place is sometimes their food was mis labeled. It would say sesame chicken but it was Mongolian beef. So they could get better at this. Other then that, it's a must try Buffett!"
1,"I could not have been more satisfied with the staff! At 22 i was shocked that they would have even scheduled me for an appointment here. But they did and I had my tonsils removed everyone I came into contact with was amazing! They truly cared to make me as comfortable as possible, they truly seemed to enjoy there jobs. Everyone has off days which one nurse I believe was but it was also 6am.  But she was still nice just different.. My aftercare nurse made sure i was comfortable and not in pain. She was so helpful and truly made my experience the best it could have been. I wish I knew her name but from the pain meds and half asleep I dont have a clue! But I would recommend this hospital to any one who has to take there child here. I know when i have my children it will be the first and only place i go!"
0,"Atmosphere is nice bar/pub style with outside seating. Staff is friendly but service is slow. I had dinner there alone at 6pm on a weekday and it took them 30 min to bring the incorrect order then another 5 min to correct it. I am visiting this area, but where I come from a Medium burger means pink in the middle. My late arriving burger was burned on the outside and cooked all the way thru.  Sweet potato tots were sweet and tasty. Overall, just okay. Nothing special. Probably would not come here again.  Lots of great restaurants to try."
0,"They screwed up my order at 4:50am on multiple accounts. Cheeseless cheeseburgers, fudgeless fudge shakes and cold fries. Not cool."
1,"I've used Brand X multiple times for gifts as well as recreational team shirts. Whether ordering 3 shirts or more than 15, the Brand X team has always been super helpful and quick to respond to my needs. They have a great turnaround time and have always had my items ready well before my deadline. I am so appreciative of their flexibility, creativity, and patience - they are my first choice for custom print jobs hands down!"
0,"Made famous only by the Harry Potter phenomenon, the Elephant House is somewhere you use the bathroom, as oppose to good food. Our sandwiches were really disappointing (oily, way too much cheese), the floors in the main dining hall were slanted in a non-hipster unflattering way. The bathroom trip saved me from giving out a 1 star review - the entire bathroom (for the ladies anyway that I can vouch for) is completely covered with Harry Potter fan notes, if the toilets weren't made out of porcelain, I can bet that it would be completely ink-covered as well."
1,The quality of food is much greater than the price.  Best Chinese take out I've had in a while.
0,"*sigh*\n\n- do not sit at the bar for dinner\n- make sure the waiter listens to you and has the right order\n- pricey food\n\nWe sat at the bar since there was a long wait for the regular tables.\n\nStarted off with smoked chicken wings, asked for ranch - instead got blue cheese! The wings were alright, nothing to rave about.\n\nI love French baguettes! The bread that was given to us as a starter was warm and good.  The salted butter complimented well with the bread.\n\nPrime rib was actually mediocre. It had some flavor, but it just needed just a tad bit more. I loved the au jus more than the meat itself. It was a let down.\n\nOverall, I am not pressed to come back. The restaurant has a nice ambiance to bring friends to drink at the bar. The food, meh, I pass."
0,"Canceled my daughter's class and rescheduled twice, then, giving me less than 24 hr notice, tried to reschedule me again but it wasn't enough notice.  Now, I have to try and get my registration money back from the class since it's not refundable yet had I known that they were going to keep moving classes around (which I know sometimes happens) I wouldn't have signed up with them.  I just hate being called at 4 pm and asked if I can start class for my daughter at 9:30 the next day.  Definately will not be going back."
1,Also went here today. Anybody who is interested in history or history of toys may want to pay a visit here.I quite enjoyed just a little nit more than the peoples story. Every picture here told a story.
0,"Hrm. Ever ask yourself where you can find a magazine that showcases all that is wrong with humanity - hedonism, addictions, overt sexuality, silicone, stupidity, bravado, high interest debit, cliques and a false sense of self? Well, look no further. 944 is here! \n\n944 says it covers fashion, entertainment and lifestyle. Fact of the matter is it caters to the fantastical - you know, the unreachable celebrity stereotype of partying all night, spending benjamins and being seen where it's ultra cool to be seen. \n\nI saw myself in 944 once. It was a double spread of Myst during their anniversary shindig. I was astounded to see myself in the middle of the dance floor with the most wretchedly uncomfortable grimace on my face. It was probably after I got hit in the head with an elbow or big lady purse. (I don't care if it's designer. It doesn't need to be the size of an Envoy.) \n\n944 gets two stars from me. I could care less about the celebrity spottings and blond bimbo fundraisers. I do like how they sometimes feature music I'm into, as well as restaurants I may want to try. I don't even mind the showcase of expensive toys I'll never be able to afford. After all, it's fun to look. But 944 can't really consider itself a magazine, can it? After all, what value does it bring? Hardly enough, unless you're out of TP and need something to wipe your ass with.\n\nSad truth is that it is an unfortunate reflection of some of the people in this world. It's okay to admit there's more to life than your prada (or is it coach?) bag and being invited to the grand opening of \""the next big thing\"" in Snottsdale."
1,"Overall, Marquee is an awesome club and for my first Vegas club experience, I was impressed. Ironically enough, many of the clubs pros can also be cons however.\n\nSuch as the multiple rooms and unique layout. Very cool and interesting while sober but extremely difficult to maneuver and keep track of after a few drinks. It's great that there are a few different settings to fit people's individual preference. We briefly walked through the hip hop room, which was small and packed, on our way outside. In November, it was quite chilly so we quickly headed upstairs to the main room. Then we wandered up even more stairs to the library, which had a nice, laidback vibe, which I would have liked better had there been a place to sit. As the night progressed and I had a few drinks, I found that locating the nearest bathroom and then finding my way back to my friends was a nearly impossible challenge. Luckily, I somehow managed to find my way but it was not without difficulty. \n\nI know there are plenty of people who like the techno/house that's played in the main AKA largest room but I've never been a fan. I need words to get into a song and dance. I remember excitedly shouting to my friend when a song with words finally blasted after an hour of steady beats. \n\nWe were lucky enough to 1) get hooked up with free entrance by a friend's promoter and 2) be welcomed to someone's table for the night. I guarantee that my feet would not have survived an entire night of standing in heels so a huge thank you to the guy who let us crash at his table!  \n\nAnother interesting note, there are a lot of stairs, including a random, vacant stairwell up to the club. Makes for an interesting evening for girls in high heels."
0,"I'm pissed. \nWent for a pre-release screening, as I've done at this location before, and it was SO unbelievably poorly set up!\n\nI arrived as I usually do, with more than enough time to spare. The line was made OUTSIDE (110 degrees, thanks!) and went all the way around the corner of the theater, wrapped back around,- past the elevators, past the trees, and up across the main front steps. \nFine enough, those who are unemployed were allowed to loiter in front of the theater all day and formed a line at 2pm for a 7pm movie (ugh), so I figured- if we weren't getting in, we weren't getting in. Disappointing, but not a big deal.. I took the risk and stayed because I watched as more people continued to show up and no one turned them away. \n\nWith that said, I have a HUGE issue with the following...\n\nThey had a specific amount of tickets READY TO HAND OUT. They could have easily given them out and let the rest of us go home! At the very least, they could have done that after the hour and a half we spent in line, once it got slightly shorter.\n\nSeriously. It's not a difficult concept. Got 15 tickets in your hand? Count out 15 people to give tickets to. I just don't understand why they kept us waiting for absolutely no reason. And with NO explanation at any point... \nThey had three employees collecting the tickets we printed at home and it was completely unnecessary....one was handing out the theater passes and two females just stood there sweating. Uh, k? \nBy 7pm, there was absolutely no end in sight, so we left.... which probably means they screwed something up and were behind schedule. Thanks for wasting my time!"
0,"Stopped in for an oil change, and left being told my breaks were about to fail due to leaking, and wanted $800.... none of that seemed right, I had not noticed any break issues. Had a mechanic friend take a look, and he assumed me it was major BS... drove all the way to Florida, and had a trusted mechanic take a look. I \""could stand that have my break pads replaced, but otherwise looks great\"". I honestly feel like they tried to \""girl\"" me into paying for unnecessary work. It is a shame because I really appreciated their shuttle service, and would have liked to use them again. Buyer beware!"
1,Genuine caring professionals committed to your success! An incredible transformative experience.
1,We like this movie theater.  It's always clean and never crowded.  Movie prices suck of courseBut if you go before noon is not to bad.  Get the cup I'd you come more than twice.  It's worth it.
1,"Conveniently located in a touristic area this store offers a large variety of food and drinks (alcohol including). \n\nI shop here every time I stay in Montreal to get some sparkling water, snacks and food (when I don't feel like eating out)."
1,"VVE is quite far from my house as i'm located on the other side of town lol. Anyways on my exploration of vape shops, one of my listed shops to visit was Vapor Emporium. I walked in and definitely liked the setup, reminded me of a cafe, seeing the tables to my right with what looked like menus laying flat. Kinda nice.\n\nI proceeded to the front counter where a lady greeted me and asked if i wanted to try some flavors. There was already a customer there, he said hi and shook my hand. I thought that was very friendly of him.  She had me take a look at all the flavors, i tried a few and thought they were pretty good.  I then asked whats their most popular and she mentioned Tidal Wave. I tested it out and immediately said \""I want this one.\"" she laughed and said \""sure!\"" \n\nAs she went to the back, the man sitting next to me and I had a nice chat. He gave me a business card and said stop by sometime. I still haven't been able to find the time sorry!!\n\nMore about the business, Tidal Wave still happens to be in my disposal as i've collected nearly 20 bottles from different vape shops around las vegas. Everytime i taste it, it tastes great and i don't think i'll ever get tired of it aha. So if you haven't tried Tidal Wave definitely try it!. VVE mixes their own juice right before you pay so it's newly made instead of sitting in a glass showcase. \n\nOverall i had a great experience here. I like the customer service, i like how the inside looks and i do like their assortment of flavors as well as their prices. Will Definitely come back when i'm in the area. A little too far for me to just go whenever i want."
0,What I love about Rubios' is that they always have beer. Always.\n\nThat is all I love though...
0,"Just visited here recently and I was severely disappointed. The toppings were stale and the prices were way too high. Oh well, back to Mojo's!"
1,The food here is amazing the quality for the price is great as is the service. But their student discount only applies to ASU students. This ridiculous rivalry between A ASU/Phoenix and U of A/Tucson has got to stop. This business should be above that I expect better off this awesome local restaurant. I gotta say this has left a bad taste in my mouth.
1,"It's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for Capriottis Sandwich Shop. I have eaten here several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the \""Best Sandwich In America\"" banner hanging out front. The sandwiches are really good... but best in America is a little far reaching.\n\nThat being said... I usually get the \""Bobby\""... Thanksgiving on a bun! It's a pretty damn good sandwich... it you like thanksgiving dinner. The turkey is freshly made, as is the stuffing they put on the sandwich. \n\nI have also had the meatball sub... also very good. \n\nI like this place. And I am pretty sure you will like this place. \n\nMake sure you tell them you signed up for their \""text message\"" program to get a free drink and chips on your first visit."
0,"Seriously, I had to wait too long for my food. I was starving and come on we ordered hot dogs. It shouldn't take too long to make a hot dog right? Especially if I there was no fixings on it. The hot dog was average, nothing I would come back for. I think I could make a better hot dog at home. I do have to say that I did enjoy their chili fries. I don't think the food was worth the wait or the price."
1,"If you're having Peruvian, you have to have the corn juice.  It's non-carbonated, sugary goodness with a hint of cloves and cinnamon.  For me, it's like an appetizer and a drink.\n\nThe chaufa is excellent here.  It's fried rice, and is very salty, but I assume if you're ordering it, you'll like that.  Get the one with chicken and beef (and shrimp if you like it).\n\nI don't think it's better than the places in NYC, but it's certainly better than the crap they serve in California.  And for Vegas, it's worth four stars.  Definitely should be tried, especially if you haven't had delicious Peruvian food."
1,"A favorite go-to for a delicious sandwich. Their sandwiches are made with the kitchen sink approach and it works fantastically. Everything looks great, but I can't seem to stray from the veggie and guac Humboldt. Love the friendly workers!"
1,"We hit up Sushi Roku Saturday night before heading to Pure for my cousin's birthday. We wanted to have a nice meal that will be just enough to fill us without making have to unbuckle my belt and go for a siesta. Since it's inside of Caesar's it's the perfect location to eat before hopping off to the club. The ambiance was lovely, the waiters were uber friendly (and very cute) and the food was top notch. Their Usuzukuri (thinly sliced of fluke with ponzu sauce) is to die for!!! \n\nIt's a bit pricey, but the free birthday dessert of assorted mochi ice cream and the little fireworks show they threw in added that special touch. Be sure to check out their wine list, its ace! I had a phenomenal glass of Riesling that I'm still thirsty for!!!"
0,"I visited english's for the high tea experience, when we were seated our table was very badly crooked so we asked the waiter straighten it out. \n\nThe waiter advised us to hold the lid to the tea pot because it falls off easily. It was very hard to catch the leaves, pour the tea and hold the lid at the same time. \n\nWe waited half an hour for our sandwiches, scones, and pastries. The sandwiches were plain and served at room temperature. The scones were bland and the powered sugar made a mess. I also didn't like any of the pastries on the top tier at all. \n\nThe atmosphere was cramped and the few waiters ran around us the entire time. \n\nWhen the manager arrived he started yelling at the waiters for no reason, then I noticed him drinking on the job as well as the servers drinking. He also made a drink behind the bar and then he took a straw and tasted it from the shaker, made a face and served the drink anyway. \n\nThe regular food looked and smelled amazing, I would've much rather have gotten regular lunch than waste my time and money on the tea. \n\nIf you are looking for high tea in Las Vegas try the Veranda at the Four Seasons resort it's pricey but well worth it. \n\nI will not be returning to English's for tea, I may stop by and try the food at happy hour because it looked delicious."

0,The jury is out on the service department at the Mesa camping world. They just opened recently so they deserve a break. My first several encounters are not extremely positive but I expect that will turn around I hope
1,"Actual Date of Visit: 10/9/2011\n\nWhen I first moved to Scottsdale I had no idea where to get a bed.  I went to Macy's but their prices were either about $500 or $1000, nothing in between.  The saleswoman at Macy's suggested Bedmart (I was so greatful for that)!  When I went to Bedmart, they had some Columbus Day specials going on.   It wasn't busy and my salesperson Randy was very helpful.   He was descriptive and honest, not pushy at all.  I got exactly what i wanted for a great price.  My only critique: Their delivery times are not necessarily the best.  It was difficult for them to work around my schedule."
0,"I'm usually a big fan of Barriques, but this location has one problem that is the reason for the two-star rating and why I won't go back. The coffee shop doesn't ventilate properly, so I leave the shop smelling like smoky bacon and have to change my clothes and shower so I can bear myself. I really hope this gets fixed so I can return, but for now I'll go to their other locations."
0,"Let me preface a few things just so we're clear as to where I'm coming from. 1. I'm from Chicago, so deep dish is where it's at, though that doesn't mean I lack the ability to appreciate a good slice when I have one, no matter the style. But pizza is pizza, and good pizza is easy to recognize.  2. This place is so hyped-up, it's difficult not to expect some very delicious food, so as you can tell by my rating, it did not meet expectations. 3. I do enjoy hatin' on things, but in reviews, I try to keep a relatively civil and open mind and give the benefit of the doubt where I can. That said, let's begin... \n\nI can only think of one word to describe Pizzeria Bianco (obvious as it may be): Overrated. I'm pretty sure the popularity of this place lies in its' exclusivity. A sense of snobbery, but its' accessible to the average Joe with 3+ hours to kill. \n\nWe arrived one evening a month so back. It was a bit of a going-away party with my fiance and I, and two of our closest friends. We knew the place was popular, so were prepared to wait. After putting our names in (if I recall, it was around 6 or so when we did such), and told of our three-hour-tour of a wait, we decided to head next door. \n\nI was told the \""bar\"" next door was owned by the same folks, so we thought why not make it a Bianco-evening. Upon entrance to the \""bar,\"" which is basically the waiting area for patient patrons, we discovered that this place was also full to the brim. Also, I should note that I keep using quotes around the word bar because they only had a few beers on tap, and a wine list. Neither of those things strikes a fancy with me, though as a self proclaimed alcoholic, I'll drink what's available. The issue though, was still that the place was packed. \n\nAfter some deliberation, and a great backup plan from my fiance, we actually decided to go across the way to the British pub (Rose and Crown I believe; awesome place too, but that's a different review). After several rounds of drinks and pool, we figured our three-hour wait was about up (it was actually a little over even). We moseyed our way back over to Bianco, and proceeded to wait another half hour or so. \n\nFinally, around 9:30 or so, we were inside and seated, fortunately enough, in my own seat and not the next patron's lap. This place is tiny (remember, exclusivity). A quarter of the restaurant is the \""kitchen\"" with the brick oven for the pizzas. Great! We can watch our pizzas come out of the oven; finally some promise... \n\nSpeaking of the food, we ordered an appetizer of prosciutto wrapped asparagus with mozzarella cheese. I hate to spoil the review early (if you can call this early), but this was the highlight of the meal, and to be honest, what doesn't taste good wrapped in prosciutto (or bacon). A bottle of wine for the table, and four ordered pizzas later, we were ready for the main-course. If you're still reading, then you know this is all down hill. Thin crust? I knew that was coming, and I'm fine with it. Surprisingly small, I think we managed to fit all four pizzas on our table without space concerns, so I'm thinking these were probably 12\"" or so (14\"" maybe?). \n\nI'm a carnivore, so I required that the pizzas we ordered contained meat, which 3 of the 4 did. Don't get me wrong, I like veggies too, but they're only part of a well rounded meal. We ordered: The Rosa, The Wiseguy, The Sonny Boy and The Biancoverde. \n\nNow I'm going to say that if you hand-cook each of your pizzas (as I was told the owner does), I would think you could manage to not send them out black on the bottom, especially after thousands of practices prior to these four. Maybe I'm not hip to how they do it in Italy, but I'm not a fan of carbon-flavored pizza crust, which all of our pizzas were. As for the top-side of the pies, they were lacking in the flavor department. Now I don't want to sit here and slam the place outright, so I will give them this: These were some of the freshest ingredients I've seen in a restaurant, which was very nice. The caveat though is that you need to support these star ingredients (fresh cheeses and veggies and meats) with some good spices, or at least aromas, both of which were M.I.A.  I can appreciate a minimalist approach, but this was bare-bones ingredient-listing.\n\nBianco is definitely not worth the time or the effort. In all actuality, you could take a pizza-cooking class, swing by the store on your way home, pick up some fresh ingredients, and cook the thing yourself (and add your own flavors to boot) in the same amount of time you would wait, sit down, eat and leave. I would have at least thought that being relatively hammered, everything would have tasted good, but alas, that wasn't the case. Save yourself the hassle, get bombed and cook your own pizza; at least you'll have a more-fun 3+ hours."
0,"Stay FAR AWAY from this place.  Complete scammers.  My girlfriend brought here car in with a slow starting problem and said she thought it may be the starter.  Without running the simple diagnostic on it to confirm this was the problem, they replaced a perfectly good starter ($550 with labor)--it was only then that they proceeded to tell her that the battery was the real problem.  I asked the manager afterwards why they would not check the starter (which literally takes 5 seconds) and said he just does what the customer asks for and was obviously unwilling to refund any portion of the unnecessary work.  So unless you (or your wife, daughter, etc) are a licensed mechanic, do not use this garage.\n\nCOMPLETE AND TOTAL SCAM ARTISTS.  You would be better off taking your vehicle literally anywhere else."
0,"Ok I love coffee bean tea leaf, I love that they have more of a tea selection because I'm not a coffee drinker. But I'm disappointed with the way this location makes it. The past three times I've stopped here it's been wrong. Even with me giving them direction. I think they are more consumed with talking to friends then being a barista."
0,"This is the second time I've hit Churchhill's and it was a disappointment. The fish was warm at best, limp with the batter separating from the fish. \n\nI've been to the UK, and this is nothing like that.\n\nThe fries were ok, coleslaw was bland, and they really did not know how to pour a Guinness pint. I would not recommend this to any serious English food fan. (And there is good food in the uk!)"
0,Just got over charged again! At Basha's and Albertson the policy is to refund the entire amount - Not Here! They just give you the amount back they tried ripping you off at!!!
1,"This was my second time here at this bar a little way off the strip... The first time I came here we were offered take-out menus since they do not serve food here. This wasn't problem this past night because right out side was the Fuku burger truck. How can I not like a place that allowed me to enter with a burger in one hand and a cigar in the other..\n\nYou certainly don't feel like your in Vegas when entering this place, with blowfish hanging from the ceiling and tribal tiki surroundings. I did receive some scornful looks for the smoke clouds I was creating but I got to tell ya... that I love this place. Low lit, and great service. I got my drinks extremely quick. Enjoyed the Fink Bomb and the Primo Lager Beer. Perfect to end the weekend at this place.\n\nHad a difficult time trying to keep my balance on their small tiki totem seats, even though they look great, not so great for sitting on. Definitely a great place to start or end your night... coming back here again for sure.."
1,In particular for not being in a great area this place is friggin sweet!  Salsa dynamite. Shrimp was excellent. Great Guac. Solid all around.
1,"We visit every Harley Store in any city we visit.\nThis by far is HUGE. The sales racks are plenty.. but in the gist of all Harleys.. everything IS expensive. \n\nHaving a Harley is accepting the price range of all accessories \""needed\"" and not-so-needed. The displays are pretty awesome and the staff helped us out with questions we had.\n\nIt was a fun visit."
1,"Eat here!! Try the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. It is melt in your mouth delicious! The onion rings are super crunchy and flavorful. \n\nThe use fresh produce that is grown right outside and use locally raised beef and chicken. Which is refreshing. \n\nOther suggestions I have are: Fontina Burger and the Sweet Potato Fries (the sweet dipping sauce for these needs to be jarred and sold!), \n\nIt's a cool little place with huge personality...even in the bathroom.  They have their condiment and drink station on the outside which is different.  If the weather is right, enjoy your meal outside under the giant tree (it's actually pretty cool!)\n\nFor me, it's quite the drive, but it is well worth it."
0,"I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.\n\nI signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.\n\nHowever when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.\n\nAs I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company."
0,"Ate there yesterday with my sister. We both shared a bowl of saimen with BBQ pork in it. After we ate it we both started to get an itchy feeling in the back of our throat and I started to get bumps on my lips. We are both allergic to shellfish. My sister then asked if they put any shrimp in the broth, they said yes. Aloha kitchen you can kill people who are allergic to shellfish and other seafood, you need to place warning on your menu!"
0,"If I could give 5 stars for just the jalape\u00f1o poppers...I totally would.\n\nI wasn't impressed.  At all.  I ordered a burger and shared a prime rib wrap (say that 5 times fast).  My burger was overdone and the wrap was uber soggy.  \n\nI was really looking forward to trying the food here after reading the reviews.  It could have just been an off night, and I will definitely give it another chance!\n\nHowever...these jalape\u00f1o poppers are LEGIT!"
1,"I've been going to this theatre ever since it opened.   It's been my favorite theatre here in Las Vegas.  The location of Rave Motion Pictures for me is a sure plus. Because at Town Square there is lots to do, shopping, eating, drinking, or just hangout and to do a little browsing, here and there. I was just going to give it a 4 star rating. But I now rate it at 5 stars all the way.  I recently discovered that Rave Motion Pictures has (ages 21 and up) shows.  So when you're looking at Showtimes, look for the shows that have (21+) next to the movie title.  This means you can order cocktails/alcohol beverages inside the theatre itself from a cocktail server. Cash or Credit Cards accepted. I was so happy to find that out.  So I order a Jack on the rocks. The Bar is located to the left of where you give your tickets. The Lounge area on the side. I'm not sure if you can buy the drinks straight from the bar, I'll have to get back on that one.  But if we can buy from the bar too.  That would make it even better.  Finally you can drink cocktails inside the theatre.  The seats are reserved seating, so when you get your tickets at the window, you can choose where to sit. Upon entering the theatre you will be shown to you seats. The seat number(s) you chose will be on your ticket stub. This kinda works because people won't usually get  seats next to you, if the show isn't too crowded. I left my Bar Tab open, So not even the middle of the movie my cocktail server returned and brought my second drink, Then took orders from other movie goers.  How sweet is that?????!!!!"
0,Yuck! I had a chicken wrap and it was very dry!!! Chicken seemed like it was frozen before and it was burnt!  Service was ok and the booth is sat in was very broken in! I had to sit on the wooden bar in the middle so I didn't sink in! The long island iced tea was very stiff!
1,i had a quick breakfast here before i left Las Vegas. I ordered the {EGG WHITE FRITTA W/ SIDE OF BACON} the fritta was good and healthy! (the bacon probably not as much so! :) but good. I also ordered the {WATERMELON JUICE} which i was a big big fan of. Just thinking about it make me wish I was there.
1,"This is a Montreal institution. The pizzas are top notch, and well worth it. But it's the subs that are the real treat. Home made pizza dough sub buns, are what really make these some of the best in the city. Note that this is a take-out/delivery place, there is no eat in dinning room."
1,"This place is always packed! Huge portions and for how short staffed they are pretty good customer service! Not the biggest selection, sad there was no bulgogi but gets the job done. It's $16.99 for ayce and after 10 on it is 13.99!"
0,Simply a great place but tonight at the Concord Mills location didn't cut it!  I'm so sad because I was so READY for steak! To Roadhouses credit the waitress was GREAT and she's not the cook. Half eaten steak and soggy grease fries I leave disappointed.
1,"It was the first time my boyfriend and I went and it seemed like they have quite a few repeat customers.  It was impressive to see the hostess/servers interact with the customers, however... I must say that we felt kinda unspecial because of that.  (i don't know if that's fair to knock them on though...)\n\nTuna tartare was eh.  The steaks were good and the lemon cake was delicious.  We couldn't finish our meal, so we packed all the leftovers ate it over 2 meals the next day.  Still delicious.\n\nOne thing that made our night was the music.  They had a pianist sing and play the piano.  It really created a classy and relaxing atmosphere."
1,"This store is set up in typical supermarket aisle fashion, but it's the U-shaped (left, right and back) area that you need to visit.  Facing the store, the goodies are veggies, fruit, bakery and juicer-y on the right; meats & fresh cheese to the back; and OMG freshly made tortillas and plated food on the left.  I started with a squeezed in front of my eyes orange/pineapple/mango juice while perusing the cilantro ($.99 for 2 big bunches), radishes (same price) and mango ($.69 each).  Everything was super fresh.  Then, I hit the meats... one of the best meat counters and cheese/deli counters I've ever seen.  I have to read up on what 3/4 of the food is, but I'm willing to do so when it looks so darn good!  When I got to the tortilleria... can you say \""nirvana\""?  Samples of guacamole, carnitas, salsa fresca and tortilla chips along with the delicious aroma of the kitchen.  Friendly, cool Latino music, good prices, what more could a gringo want?  Oh, and everything I bought was absolutely delicioso!  Mi familia said \""muy bueno\""!"
1,"Good Mexican Mexican food. Generous portions, good flavor, been in Scottsdale for a very long tome and has been recognized locally for it's food quality, I'm hooked on the flour tortilla chips! You can request to have only flour instead of the corn and flour mix they usually bring. Salsa is more salsa fresca than blender salsa. Outdoor patio has misters and is very quaint. Good Eats..."
0,"Stay home and eat a frozen Swanson meal, it will be much better than any of the slop this joint serves."
0,"Reserved room a week in advance and requested 11am early check in, is now 3:45pm and we've been waiting at the resort all day. Classic bad business: under delivering after over promising. The Grand just a few miles away seems like a much better option."
0,"Rented both dry and wet storage. Service was very middle of the road, and several policies hard to swallow. For example, If I took guests to the dinning room, my guests meals were charged at a higher rate, embarrassing and hard to explain if you split a check.\n\nAfter 4 years decided to cancel, was given a very hard time, management insisted we had a year contract and must pay. Our agreement was month to month. After several exchanges, Pleasant Harbor agreed to cancel, given we did not sign a year contract. Now I am told a refund won't be issued until late February at the earliest even though we were done in November."
1,"Wandered into this place after being in the desert for 8 days. It was quite the culture shock: mostly the food wasn't freeze dried and was delicious! We got there around 7:00 and had no problem getting a table. Now, the food was pretty good and I'll get to that in a second. But first we need to address why this place doesn't get 5 stars. It has to do with the fact that we had 3 different servers who were kind of difficult to track down. I know, it's nit-picky, but our first server whispered in a thick french accent, our second server wasn't sure what the first had told us or taken as an order, and the third didn't speak at all. \n\nBeyond that, however, the food was tres magnifique! (Apologies to francophiles if I misspelled any of that...) We started with the baked goat cheese which came with a stunning crispy yet soft herb bread. Then, shocker of all evening, my \""burger and fries\"" boyfriend ordered a steak, and ordered it medium rare! (We're talking about a \""everything should be well-done thank you very much,\"" kind of guy here, so you should be shocked, too!) He got the steak roquefort  (bleu cheese sauce) and ate pretty much the whole thing. I ordered the Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onions red wine reduction) and ate pretty much all of it. (Ok, you caught me. I ate the whole thing. It was tasty. And I regret nothing.)\n\nIn addition, there are two other noteworthy items: 1) St. Germain +champagne cocktails = baaaannnnggggiiiinnng; 2) while there were multiple servers working our table, not one of them made an attempt to rush out. We got to linger over every course which, again, was freaking wonderful after rush rush travel travel we had endured for the last 24 hrs. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this little spot in Paris Las Vegas.   \n\nAnd seriously, get the St. Germain-tasty-nectar-of-the-gods-in-a-very-formal-french-way cocktail. You'll love it. I think. Or you should. Whatever, just try the steak ok? I know you won't regret that."
1,Very unique and quite delicious food! We have tried several different entrees and they all are fantastic! Crab Rangoon's are a must here!
0,"I went here once when I was in Vegas with family (and we really didn't have an idea of what to eat). The food was okay. I had a kimchi stew, but I thought it was somewhat disappointing.  The amount of kimchi served was almost nothing...and they charged my mother two dollars extra for an extra serving when she asked. Most korean places would serve you extra for free. \n\nMy mother and sister ordered fried rice. The portions were terrible and I thought it didn't even smell that good when it was delivered. It looked like something I could've easily batched up for under 2 dollars, though in much higher quantities. \n\nIt gets even worse when they automatically add 18% gratuity when the service is virtually non-existent. Turned what was a 36 dollar meal in to a 50 dollar meal after gratuity and taxes. Terrible."

0,"\""Very rude waitress. Under staffed. One blue moon was $9.50 after tax. I waited 18 minutes before I was served. They make you pay and tip immediately. The waitress rolled her eyes at me and said, \""Really?\"" when I tipped her 10%...when she deserved no tip. AVOID!!!\"""
1,one of my fav hotels
1,"This is the second time coming to Genghis Grill and to tell you the true I was a little skeptical in going in again because the service the first time at the Tempe Market where waitresses and waiters were very indiferent to even check periodically or ask if we needed. Anything else also it took a while to get. A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check, the food was good overall\nMy experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detail,from the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure."
1,"I don't like to visit a dentist. Nobody likes it. I think even dentists don;t like to do it. Usually I felt embarrassed and uncomfortable when someone is looking into my mouth.  But not here.\nFirst time I came here for a simple check-in. It was good. And for me it was important that Doctors explained to me difficult words as English is not my native language. \nMy second visit was emergency. I awfully cracked one tooth. It looked very ugly and gross. Oh well, I came here again. When Dr looked the tooth, I heard only one phase \""We will fix it\"". And they did! It was awesome, guys! They not only fix it, they did it on very high satisfied level: fast, comfortable, not painful at all. The strangest thing is this visit was enjoyable hehe \nP.S. While they were working on my tooth, I was watching a movie on a big TV next to a patient's chair.\n\nThanks, Docs, I can chew again ;)"
1,"Nice little family place. Some of the dishes I had didn't taste quite right. Overall, pretty authentic though."
1,We missed Harvest moon but wanted to try this new place. I ordered the Fried hot chicken Sammy. Oh My God!!! It was just amazing. It was so full of flavor that I relished each and every bite. There was no conversation during this lunch since everyone was lost in their food.\nAMAZING!!
0,"When I first walked in, I thought it was a really nice place, we rented a private room to watch a program that a coworker was being featured on, and the decor all over the place was really cool.  I ordered a glass of wine for my wife and bottled water for myself and it took alot longer than it should have, the bar had a  few people in there but it really wasn't THAT busy, but we eventually got our drinks, I tipped appropriately and when it came time to order my next one, I heard lots of \""be right with you\"" from a few different people, and lots of eye contact, hand raising, waving money,  but no service.  15 minutes later in a bar that isn't busy at all, I ended up just walking away, of course at that point the girl asked \""what can I get you honey\"".  I just said \""never mind\"" and now I know not to go in there again, a shame because we initially thought about renting the room from them again in the future. Also, no waitresses came into our room to see if we needed a refill or took away any empty glasses, which is usually the case in other establishments, but there were several walking around the rest of the place.  Oh well, you heard it here, maybe this place is more into taking care of their regulars and ignoring the newcomers, or maybe it was just an off night, either way, they presented nothing for me to want to return."
0,"I had a 2 for 1 coupon which is what inspired me to come here for dinner. The veggies were fresh but the meat was only so-so. I had a steak salad and the meat was very thinly sliced- which I liked- but I think it was to mask the grade of the beef.\n\nThe food was not visually appealing. And I had to smother my salad in various sauces to get any flavor out of it. The meat again... lacked flavor.\n\nI watched the woman make my salad and she weighed the amount of meat that was to go into the salad. I watched her pile the meat on top of the lettuce and watch a few pieces fall off the side. I then watched her place my salad to the side to be bagged while while she made my friend's entree. She took the meat that fell off the sides of my bowl (which was weighed once already)  and put it on the scale along with some more meat for my friend's entree.\n\nI stood there thinking.... HEY! I've just been shorted some meat and basically charged twice for it!\n\nHonestly, it wasn't a big enough portion to really complain about but people working in open kitchens should know that they're being watched by the customer and that we're all very critical with the way food is handled since we're paying for it and it's eventually going in our tummies.\n\nI have another 2 for 1 coupon and I'll probably give it away to someone else. You won't see me here again."
0,"its okay...not good not bad...\n\nI order a number 11, rare steak pho....the bowl is very small and the meat quality is below average. I will not be coming back. I paid 7.51 for a bowl of rare steak pho that was very small.\n\nThe restaurant is not very clean. Alot of fobs eat here. No-then wrong with that.  But being clean is a question mark here."
1,"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant, and in my opinion the best one in Matthews and maybe even Charlotte. It has great food and never once has anyone I know been disappointed here. It's service is good and quick. The food is great and seems to be always fresh. Definitely recommended."
0,"I was very hesitant to write this review because I really enjoyed coming to this salon. The staff is really friendly, good location, and reasonable prices, however after a couple not so great haircuts and then the one I got two weeks ago I feel I need to write it because had I paid closer attention to the reviews I would have gone with a different stylist. I've been to the salon about 5 times and have had my hair colored (which turned out pretty good) but the haircuts have been hit or miss - which usually varied between leaving feeling like my hair wasn't cut at all or was cut too much. I like to bring a picture so the stylist knows exactly what I'm looking for. I did this for my last cut which was taking my hair from mid-back to just below my shoulders. I've had my hair cut short MANY times so this was not a case of a shockingly short cut. The stylist put her own spin on it and decided to add lots of layers (although there were NO layers in the picture). When she first cut the length off I was actually quite happy, but by the time she was done adding layers (for some reason) it was HORRIBLE. I've pulled my hair back in a ponytail every day since. It's the worst haircut I've ever had. When I said something about the layers she didn't really seem to care much and said they were long layers. Again, never asked for or wanted layers. I'm guessing it will take about 6 months to get it to a place I can stand. I'm tempted to just cut it even shorter to get rid of the layers but that is not what I wanted to do and I need to find another salon to have this done. So, in a nutshell, salon seemed great but I wouldn't have Serena cut my hair again or return to the salon."
0,"My wife & I use to eat here every day 2 years ago! This morning I brought my daughter to Lucys bar & grill she had hotcakes & eggs, I had the $9.99 steak & lobster tail they served it to me cold, I sent it back to be reheated & it was awful! They told me they ran out of veggies & baked potatoes This place has slid downhill! I don't see any familiar faces, its too bad but I almost called the health dept. Avoid this place at all costs!"
0,"I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why. \n\nI can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.\n\nBacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this. \n\nFried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs \""over medium\"" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger. \n\nTillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.\n\nSpecial sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.\n\nFries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.\n\nHamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.\n\nOn the plate, there were also two kinds of \""pickles\"". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.\n\nIt's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon."
0,I have never been so upset and turned off at a restaraunt before.  Went out for a night with my friends and it took over an hour to get out food! The waitress NEVER bothered to let us know or offer us a drink on the house...something. After all that wait I get my popcorn shrimp only to find the most pathetic looking shrimp that were not deceived.  I was so disgusted. \n\nNever going back to this Madison location.
1,went here awhile back.\nthe one thing i remember though is really good food:)
0,"Short version: If I hadn't ever eaten at Texas de Brazil maybe this would have gotten 2 stars. If the price reflected the quality of the food they gave me in any way, maybe it would have gotten 3. Neither of those are the case. Cheap off-tasting meat, poorly seasoned and cooked, staff that doesn't know rare from well done, tiny and unappetizing salad bar, mediocre desserts, ridiculously expensive. Never again.\n\nLet me start with the most ridiculous part of the night: I asked them to send over the guy with the filet mignon, and they said they don't serve filet. If you're going to charge me $77/person for tiny nuggets of meat, and $10/drink, not having a filet mignon is unacceptable. I wouldn't come back for that alone.\n\nWent here for New Year's Eve, The meats were poorly and inconsistently seasoned. Some too little, some too much. The servers have absolutely no idea what level their meats are cooked to. My fianc\u00e9 asked for a piece medium, and got barely-even-cooked rare. I asked for a piece medium, and got shoe-leather well done. Every meat we asked for was asked for medium and I don't think I got an actual medium piece all night. \n\nThe salad bar is extremely small, and choices are limited and . Unlike Texas de Brazil, many of the items are also \""prepared\"" items, like soups, which makes the \""salad\"" portion of the salad bar even smaller. \n\nAfter midnight the salad bar turned into a dessert bar. That was an awesome idea! Except the only thing that tasted any good were the sorbet cups, and they never once restocked them. My table of four got to share two tiny melon-baller-sized scoops between us and no matter how many times we checked they never brought any more out.\n\nThey did have a DJ, and I can't complain about him although I'm not a big DJ person so I couldn't tell you if he was good or bad. He's just background music to me. \n\nThere's no coat rack. Not really something you see a lot of in Vegas, I know, but it's 30\u00b0 outside and I saw a lot of coats draped over extra chairs, in the flowers, across laps...this doesn't have anything to do with my 1-star rating but it really annoyed me.\n\nThere are two kinds of staff here, as far as I'm concerned: the meat-bearers and everybody else. Regardless of my issues with the meat bearers (completely lost on rare, medium, etc; relatively inattentive), the rest of the staff was excellent. Our waitress was always checking up on us, our drinks were never empty, the hostesses were polite and even came to get us from the bar while we waited for our table instead of having us stand in the reception area. (Why don't they have buzzers, anyway? No matter, they did an admirable job the old fashioned way.) In spite of all of this, my experience was definitely negative. Which is a shame, because I was REALLY hoping to have a place like Texas de Brazil on my end of town.\n\nThey brought us out a $20 gift card at the end of the night, and the waitress said that it was good for our next visit if we just followed the instructions on the back. My friend handed it to me since he didn't plan on ever coming back. I left it on the table with the check because I don't plan on ever coming back either. Neither of us even bothered to read the \""instructions\""."
0,Disappointed!! They  forgot I ordered coffee then didn't refill then food was cold.  The two stars is they took my meal off the bill.  Will not return.
0,"La cuisine est plut\u00f4t fade et pas vraiment indienne. Le choix est limit\u00e9 et il n'y a rien de bien cr\u00e9atif au menu.

1,"My wife and I went there last week for breakfast.  First time there.  This is one of the best crepe places that we have eaten at. We have tried many places in Vegas,  Quebec, Montreals, Canada. Good selection for sweet creeps and regular breakfast and lunch style crepes. Saw the Greek salad crepes, and look so good. Friendly staffs, clean, and good selection of different water that you have to serve yourself. They put cucumber and lemon in a water pitcher that you can serve yourself. There were one more but does not remember. They are very busy on the weekends according to a staffer. There are line of people waiting. I gave a four instead of five, because you kind of have to serve yourself with water. Not sure if this a restaurant, restaurant or a Starbucks type. They bring you your food at the table. I tip like I would at a restaurant, but you have a server at the restaurant. This is not a big deal. We would come back, nd recommend to our friends."
0,"This place is ok. Yesterday was my second time visiting. It was my birthday so thought I would get myself some treats. I got the chicken and beef empanadas, the guava and cream cheese stuffed pastry, tres leches cake and flan (don't worry, I didn't eat it all at once :). It was my first time trying flan; after two bites, I realized it's just not for me. The pastries were dry; I love empanadas but these were more like beef and chicken patties, just not flavorful enough. And I've seen reviews saying this is \""the best tres leches cake .\"" I have to disagree; the icing and sprinkles take away from the cake and it's pretty dry for a cake that should be soaked in three kinds of milk. For the best tres leches, go to Viva Chicken. The girl at the counter was friendly and helpful though."
0,"Erm, this place is closed or out of business? I went there yesterday about midday. All I saw inside was a painter's bucket and a couple of office desks. Their website says they're \""Now Open!\"" but unless they've moved (there was no sign indicating this) the place doesn't exist."
0,"We waited 45 minutes for this shuttle in front of the Flamingo to take us to the airport.  Called after 20 minutes and was told that 2 shuttles had already been dispatched, and another would be there in a few minutes.  No shuttle arrived.  We ended up paying another shuttle company to drive us to the airport.  My advice?  Don't buy a round-trip ticket!"
1,"OE. A staple of my college career. I recently came back during CMU Carnival, and it still has not changed. Service is still super quick, the restaurant is no-frills but relatively clean, prices are still rock bottom and my favorite dishes were still exactly how I liked them. $6 lunch specials still? Seems like inflation didn't really hit them too hard. Hard to beat this kind of value.\n\nThat said, you have to know what to order here. Some of their dishes are better than others. I usually go with the salt and pepper pork chop, Singapore mi fun, string beans, salt fish chicken fried rice, and beef noodle soup. Again, the food comes out super fast, so you have to wonder if they're keeping it behind doors with heat lamps or something, but regardless, it doesn't taste like it.\n\nI would recommend against the bubble tea here, as the bubbles are a bit harder than most other bubble tea places around. Go to the Rose Tea Cafe across the street, or even Lulu's for better bubble tea. Or just get the tea without the bubbles and you should be okay.\n\nQuick, cheap, relatively high quality Chinese food at a convenient location? Look no further than OE."
1,"Enjoyed it. More fun than the 2 times I've been to the strip. We asked the locals about things to do. This was one of them and they were right. It was cool. Cool and fun are subjective, though. To each their own. \n\nChatted with the hilarious charismatic bartender Nae in some bar (she should have her own tv show), saw a quarter of a mile long LED arch monitor play a Queen show, three different bands, then went ziplining above the same street. There were some funny people on this Street also, like the scantily dressed tranny dancing for hours (wtf?). And this was a Tuesday night."
0,"Think Twice before shopping here!!! I was leary of ordering a Mother of the Bride dress from a catalog from a store with a no return policy, so the owner, Todd, agreed to let me get a full refund if I didn't like the dress. Thank goodness I got it in writing. I ordered the dress in purple and size Y, it arrived in gray and size Z. Todd tried to tell me I ordered that size and color, but \""agreed\"" to reorder it. I went back a week later to find a dress in purple, but the wrong size and wrong STYLE. Todd tried to tell me I AGREED to change the style when my original selection wasn't available and I told him NO WAY would I have picked that style!!! I asked for my refund, and he started to pontificate on my errors. When I husband stepped in and said just give us the refund, Todd got very agitated and raised his voice, telling my husband it was HIS store and HE would speak if he wanted to. He then proceeded to lecture me in a condesending way about how I \""forgot\"" our conversation. I finally asked if he was finished speaking so I could get my refund and leave. Had he simply told the truth when the first dress came in wrong and allowed ME to pick another one, he may have gotten the sale. As of now, he has lost a future customer, no matter how nice their clothes are."

0,The worst service ever bundled with sub-standard Einstein food and a filthy store.  I wish they would close this location so it's no longer an option. I've given this place too many chances and they've disappointed every time.
0,"many people i know raved about pekara, so one day i decided to give it a try. i was disappointed because two items that i had were nothing more than a chocolate cake and a cream puff. the texture was kinda hard and they were just sweet with no other taste."
0,"Horrible customer service after the fact. While the product they delivered was top notch, getting in touch with anyone after payment was impossible. They were used to help cater a local event. Once my payment was processed I could not reach one person to help me with questions after the fact. I called and texted numerous times, approx. 7. I received 1 return phone call only to be left a message that basically said they were not sure what else they could do. I would not recommend using their services for another event."
1,"The front awning says greatest sandwich place! Quite a claim, and overall they deliver most of that claim! We shared the Earl's club. The bread was fresh and so was the turkey. It was nice that the bacon was warm too, as no one likes cold bacon. The lettuce and tomato was fresh. A very tasty sandwich for sure.\nWe also shared a turkey chili soup which was tasty. Overall very good, and we will be back to try other sandwiches."
1,"I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.\n\nThis is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience."
1,"Hmm.... How should I describe this place. \nEPIC!!!! I wish I could end here, but I want to give this place a five star. So, I must continue on and re-stating what other 650 people have already mentioned. Because my review gets added as a tip, not a review.\n\nI love the fresh salsa made from scratch with a hint of Korean flavor. Its like J-Lo marrying Psy!! No, I am just kidding. All of the food I ordered here were fresh and superb and packed with fresh veggies and flavor! Very good price with fast friendly servers!!!"
0,"The only reason this place even gets two stars is because a really nice waitress took over our service. We were seated waited for 10 minutes before anyone came to even acknowledge us. After that they brought us out waters but didn't bring our actual drink orders for another 20 minutes, or came to take our order. Meanwhile other parties were seated and served right away. Anyway, the service was absolutely awful. Make sure to bring a guy next time you stop by."

0,"When you first open your doors for business it is imperative that you make a good and consistent first impression.  It is also critical that your staff is ready to open.  from what i saw and the other negative reviews it seems that they have failed horribly. \n\ni went with my girlfriend for lunch today. entered the front door to a few employees that seemed a little confused, expected for first week.  we chose to sit outside on the bottom patio to do some people watching.  its a nice patio.\n\nSIDENOTE. i just dont understand why there are so many patios build 4 feet away form the road.  scottsdale road is busy mid day and it can be a little irritating eating and drinking with exhaust fumes from city busses, loud hogs (choppers or motorcycles) ghetto people playing bad music too loud with their windows down, thinking they are hardcore, but then again its people watching.  ANYWAY\n\neverything was fine until we ordered our food. a salad and ahi tacos. SMALL menu.  NOTHING exciting.  quite the boring menu.  i had higher expectations.  anyway ,after we ordered i asked if i could glance at the dinner menu, our server said \""yea i think i can find one of those.\""  when he returned empty handed 15 mins later to refill my soda, his response was that the dinner menu was still in the works and not yet available,  hopefully wednesday.  ok whatever.  he then says that the kitchen has had some issues and had to cut the tuna to order.  ok whatever i can kind understand that too.  however, i can personally cut and portion about ten pounds of ahi tuna in ten minutes by myself.  hopefully a fully staffed kitchen can handle a not very busy lunch, right?!?   wrong.  more time goes by and when our server returned to say our food was still not quite ready yet i told him we were leaving.  and we walked.  all in all we waited about twenty five minutes for a seared piece of tuna and a salad.  this should take about 5 minutes, 10 if your slammed.  if for whatever reson it takes longer a manager should stop by and show face.  there was nothing.  no concern from management.  i didnt even see one.  the server did seem genuinly apologetic and i left him some cash for the time in his table.  on our way back to the car we saw mission and, starving, we went there and had a great lunch.  sorry RnR but you screwed up.  you are clearly not ready for business and need to do some retraining.  i heard they had hired a quality exec chef and then fired him before opening.  the only thing you are good for now is an overpriced beer and overflow from the blue moose durring spring training.  maybe some ASU hunting grounds.  that seems fitting for what you have."

0,We have been here many times but tonight's ayce experience made us think about not going back there again. Food servers acted like they did not want us there. Felt like being rushed out. They missed a couple of our orders on the ayce list.  My last order was the dancing eel. It was not served to us yet and the waitress was already giving us the check. We felt like they wanted us out so we paid and left without getting our last order. Been in the food beverage industry for almost 10yrs. Would never treat my guests this way. Makes me sad since they have really good sushi. I
1,"Fantastic Service. I called regarding a leak in my house this morning and Dennis arrived in 20 minutes. I mean, I was still talking about what to do about the leak and they were at the door. \n\nThe service was fast, professional and very cost effective. Even the advice on  making sure to avoid mold was worth it. \n\nI could not recommend them enough. Thank you so much for the efforts."
1,"Over the years Lulu keeps getting better. The location is in a charming historic home with a small patio surrounded by greenery.\n\nBrunch recently was decadent, sensible portions- not tiny but not plate overflowing.\n\nI had a chance to sample the lamb hash. YES! but $18 so maybe yes - is more prudent.\n\nI had a lovely salad with chicken livers and a five minute egg. Overall prices are reasonable for the food variety and quality. There were easily five or six items on the menu that seemed very unique and I struggled with making the right choice ordering. Real life problems you know.\n\nI want to try their famous Lulu burger with fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese.\n\nLike others mentioned the service does not match the food quality but it is not awful - just could be more friendly, efficient and polished to gain a fifth star."

0,"These guys are terrible.  They gave me a 2 hour window.  Ok I understand that.  I called during the window to get an idea of when they would be here.  The guy said 15-20 minutes.  Ok, fine.  I called a half hour later telling the guy that they have not showed up.  He told me he was just about to call me and they'd be here in 15-20 minutes.  That would have been after the scheduled window. I told him I wanted to cancel and he started arguing with me, so I hung up."
0,"My family and I ate here on Sunday August 17 and got the same cold and unfriendly service we got the two previous times we've been there before. We kept going back because of the sliced beef with noodle soup and tolerated the service. We didn't get the usual peanuts and salad at the beginning and I had to get up and get our own straws for our water. We weren't asked if we wanted something to drink, they just brought warm water without straws and immediately we were asked what we wanted. I keep asking myself if it's the culture difference that makes them act so indifferent towards the customers. Anyways we ate and left because we were being watched by the lady at the cashier to see when we were done from the beginning of our meal. We felt rushed to say the least even though there was still 45minutes till they closed. The worst part was halfway home when my girlfriend and I had to make an emergency stop at a bathroom because of the beef noodle soup we had. We have had it before but this was the only time our stomachs did not agree with the food. I don't think we will be returning. Decent noodles but gawd awful service. Hope this helps.  \n\nOh and I kept noticing the noodles chef messing with his phone between stretching the noodles without washing his hands. (No gloves either)"
0,"Over-rated, and you pay for the pictures on the wall, not the food itself. The food was bland, unflavored; the lobster was less tasty than something from red lobster.\n\nAll the good tables are reserved for casino high-rollers -- when I drop $500+ for a meal, I don't expect to be treated as a second class citizen. Noisy atmosphere too.\n\nWouldn't go back."
0,"I literally just walked out of this store and was so disappointed. My husband and I just spent 15-20 minutes looking for fun things to buy our dog as its her birthday (yes, we are those kinds of parents). The old man at the register said not a single word to either of us. We were not greeted or even asked of we needed help with anything. He didn't even look up from his computer. We would have made several purchases but decided not to give this establishment any of our money. We will not ever return."
1,"Great place to buy used stuff for kids. They've got a little bit of everything -- toys, strollers, pack-n-plays, clothes, high chairs, etc. Items are usually in great shape and in working order. We ended up buying about 4 shirts and 2 or 3 shorts for our two year old for less than $40. If you buy brand new stuff from Carters , Kids R Us, or anywhere else you'd be lucky to buy 3 items for that amount. There are a lot of good finds in the store. Clothes from brand name places like the Gap or Calvin Klein. They're constantly getting new stuff so go there often and check it out."
0,"Poor service, slow to get food and drinks. When we finally received food most of ours were cold."
1,"We stayed at the Luxor for 5 days, 4 nights in December. While reading other reviews I was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.  Other then that I had no major worries. Check-in process was insane. There were so many people trying to check-in and out that you could not tell which line went where. Also there were many Luxor employees \""hanging\"" around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go. Once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more check-in stations.\n\nWe were in the Pyramid and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy. My only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new TV. My only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.\n\nAs for the casino it is just like all the others I have ever been too. My biggest complaint of all the casino is Vegas are that they allow smoking which is disgusting and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings. During the day and early afternoon I was fine but once the early evening and late night hit I could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.\n\nFood was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casual dining plus two Starbucks. It was not that big of a deal to us because we went to Mandalay Bay and New York, New York for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways. I just wish they had a few more options for breakfast other then Mcdonalds, Starbucks, and the Pyramid Cafe.\n\nThere were about three shops in the Luxor so just go next door to Mandalay or down to City Center or Planet Hollywood to get your shopping fix. As for entertainment the Luxor has Criss Angel's Believe, Carrot Top, Fantasy, and Menopause the Musical. We saw Criss Angel and I was not impressed. Compared to the other hotels on the strip Luxor needs to think about getting some more or different shows. We did not try any of the bars or lounges at Luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on Monday and Tuesdays.\n\nCheck-out was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card. We just used the express check-out located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our keys which avoided the long check-out line.\n\nOverall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people. I would not hesitate to stay again."
1,"My wife and I both lived in Thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out Thai places in the Valley. We were not disappointed with Thai Chili. Pleasant atmosphere (just about the only Thai restaurant I've been to with tablecloths. This could be a mistake since the usual way to eat Thai food -- passing around and sharing several dishes -- can get messy). We shared larb gai (spicy minced chicken with mint and other things) and green curry. We can recommend both, and there was enough so we could bring some home. We had both dishes at \""spice 10,\"" and it was quite hot, the way we like it. If you prefer it milder just get a lower number."
0,"I fell for the hype.\n\nNovelties like free peanuts and the new automated touch screen soda fountains, does not guarantee good food.\n\nFirst the french fries.  They are not shoe string fries and shouldn't be advertised as such.  You expect a crispy fry because of the lack of thickness... these are only a smidge smaller than steak fries and with that, more soggy and less crispy.  You do get a boat load of them though.\n\nSecondly, this is not fast food.  You sit and wait just like at a Fuddruckers.  Not having a wait staff to bring you your food does not make a fast food joint.  It's slower than IN and OUT, but faster than a Red Robin.\n\nThere seems to be a trend in them advertising things that they are not.  Maybe I'm spending to much time watching the food network, but if you are going to say something is a certain thing, it should be, yes?\n\nI've got to agree with some of the other disappointed customers, the burgers are flat taste wise.  Having an extensive \""condiment\"" list can't compensate for that.  The toppings pale in comparison to the quality you'd get on a double-double elsewhere.  I'm also pretty sure the grilled mushrooms are canned (try getting a grilled flavor out of something that is waterlogged)\n\nLastly 13 bucks for a bacon double, fries and a soft drink is not worth it.\n\nMaybe being in Phoenix and having IN and OUT's for fresh burgers and Fatburger's for the expanded line of condiments (who doesn't love a fried egg on their cheese burger) just kinda spoiled me in that I can't see coming back.  Because 5 guys is kind of an expensive combination of the two, but does nothing better than them.\n\nBut hey, if free peanuts is your thing, have at it."
1,"This place is amazing. \n\nMac n cheese, thirsty crow, good music, eclectic crowd, right off the lite rail what else could you want! \n\nThe staff here is so personable, they remember your name, what you like to drink & they greet you like a family member they haven't seen in years\n\nI give it 5 stars because the food, atmosphere, service and cocktails are top notch! I can't think of anything to complain about. Lux has something special in its DNA That I have not experienced anywhere else I've ever been."
1,"Smelly Dog is a staple in CenPho.  I've been taking my dogs here for several years.  Previously, I'd been very happy with the service that I had received.  Like other reviews, I've always gotten great smiling service and my dogs always looked great after grooming and tired as all get out after doggie day care.\n\nRecently, I got my little miniature schnauzer and thought \""What a wonderful way to exhaust him... i'll take in him in for doggie day care.\"".  Never having actually looked at the facility where my little guy was going to be staying, I decided to ask for a tour.  Our request was granted (minus a few looks of concern from the staff) and we went back to the day care area.\n\nAlmost immediately my stomach dropped.  You have to walk outside the storefront to what I can only describe as a converted old garage.  Walking through the gates we were met by a gentleman that reeked of last nights alcohol.  We were not allowed to walk through the facility, rather we were shown what we could see from the gated entrance.  Bleek, boring and not well maintained are the words I can use to describe what we saw.  Zero grass and and old dusty ground is all there was to lay in and they only break out the pool on \""special days\"".  Long story short there just isn't much to stimulate.\n\nIt is my opinion that a little bit of paint and some minor landscaping (fake astro turf even) and this place would be amazing.  I can only imagine my lack of excitement would be translated into a lackluster experience for my little guy.  Whenever possible I like to patronize local establishments before the big box stores.  Until a little bit of care is invested in the doggie day care facility we will not be back.  I really hope some consideration is given to updating the facility and hiring some more responsible staff for day care because we'd love to come back!!\n\nThe boutique section and grooming are all great.  I look forward to continuing to use this part of the business."
1,"Atmospherorific. That is a new word I want spread around for LGO because it entails all I want out of a restaurant. Of course good food, jeez, let me get to that, but as far as elemental funtastic vibes are concerned, this place hits the mark on many points.\n     Ok, so the food. Yum. I really like the Daybreaker that is an egg white omelet with turkey and their own tomato avocado salsa but the other day I ventured into \""normalcy\"" and just had 2 eggs cooked \""my way\"" and bacon which maybe I stand alone on this, but love it crispy and it was perfect.\nYou can also get a bottle of wine and they'll open it for you, but overall, the place is kind of self serve which is fine because I can serve myself. Get your own napkins, water, coffee fixings, etc. Think I can handle that for a change.\n     LGO is the ideal complement to the next door Postino, especially if you're out for the day. LGO grocery for breakie/brunch then off to Postino for some $5 wines daydrinking extravaganza...they're like the Bert and Ernie of Campbell & 40th street. Or maybe a better reference would be Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel seeing the one is better during the day and one is better during the night. \n     Ah, references shmereferences. LGO kicks ass :)"
0,"Ok, I have to admit, I really wanted to like this place.  This whole \""upscale burger joint\"" concept is really growing right now and I kinda dig the idea.  I've been here on three occasions, hoping that I was just missing something.  Unfortunately, It's just not that good. \n\nAs others have mentioned, the staff really seems to try and are friendly.  The atmosphere is as expected.  Sort of an industrial/modern atmosphere with lots of wood.  It's a new facility, so it's clean and tidy in upkeep.  Can't fault any of these items.\n\nBut then there's the food.  Burgers, fries, drinks and  shakes.  Pretty much that's it.  There is a selection of theme burgers and a build-your-own option.  First time I went I had the basic Cheeseburger.  It came promptly in a basket with a pile of fries.  The burger was covered in so many toppings that it was really just a topping sandwich flavored with meat.  Everything was so greasy and sloppy that you really had to eat it with a knife and fork.  Meh, not my thing.  But I figured I'd give it one more chance and try a build-your-own next time.  This wasn't much better. There's just no flavor to the burger and it's a sloppy mess to eat.  I decided to splurge on a shake this time to take with me.  By the time all was said and done, I was out darn near $15.00.  Way too expensive for a burger and fries.  Then, about two weeks ago, I was late to an appointment and needed a quick lunch.  As I mentioned, I really wanted to like this place so I decided to swing in and give it one more try.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger this time.  Even worse than the first two.  Size and quality had dropped from the first two times, always a bad sign.  Seems like they are starting to cut corners.  Again, dropping $10 for lunch really isn't going to work.  Culver's, on a good day, make a way better burger for quite a bit less.\n\nThere are a couple new places with this theme opening in the next few months around town.  Let's hope they are an improvement."
0,"Hoo boy... if you're looking for the tool section Crowbar is for you.  Somewhere between a gas station and tattoo shop in a strip mall in northwest las vegas is where you'll find this magnet for fauxhawks and lower back tattoos.  I haven't been here in years and don't plan on changing that anytime soon.  Parking is not a problem, the venue is large enough and has the same selection of booze you'll find at any neighborhood bar.  However, it's the clientele that earns this place a lonely star."

1,"If you want Greek food, I suggest checking this place out.  Forget about Opa, or that drive thru Greek crap in town.  This place has it all and does it right.  I'm not a true fan of Greek fare, but when I am in the mood for it, this place is the stop I'll make.\n\nFirst, it's easy to order, well priced, and they have a lot of dishes you wouldn't normally see at the other Mediterranean places.What they do have that others serve is done well.  Their pita is soft and chewy, the meats are well seasoned and delish, and their sauces (yogurt, hummus, etc.) taste fresh and served in generous portions.  The gyro I ordered could honestly feed two people or one hungry big guy.  I'm a big girl myself and I couldn't eat the entire thing.  They keep their gyro's simple, too--onion, cucumber and the sauce.  Done.  I love that.\n\nWant to Greek out?  Head here for some nummies and bring an empty stomach.  They do take out, too."

1,As a Pomeranian breeder I usually groom my own dogs but have been rather busy.... I called prestige and they got 3 of my dogs in the following day... Had the grooming done in about 2 hours and they look stunning!!!! Couldn't be happier and will be referring everyone.... Price is also nearly half what I was paying elsewhere and I love the multi dog discount.
0,This is not a good spot if you like clean modern hotel rooms. I upgraded to an executive suite and the couch is so nasty as well the ceiling has the popcorn style. If I didn't already change one room today I would actually ask to be changed again. This is more of a large motel.
0,"Bottom line:  go for the beer and atmosphere, don't eat here.\n\nI've eaten at the GB in DC and had high expectations of GB Las Vegas - but was very disappointed.  My friends had the pasta and red sauce and indicated that they could still taste the ketchup in the sauce.  Another friend had the tempura shrimp and chicken that was good in portion, but lacking in flavor.  I had the equivalent of chicken Marsala.  Portions were small - 3 pieces of chicken slightly bigger than a silver dollar and less than a quarter inch in thickness.  Complimenting the chicken was a scoop of potatoes and another helping of squash.  My dinner was small, lacked flavor and cost $29 - not including beer.  My buds and I were still hungry after 'dinner' so we went to BK to satisfy our hunger.\n\nBeer was good.  GBs marzen is the closest brew I've found that rivals real German marzens.  \n\nNo kidding - save your money.  Go for the beer and atmosphere.  Have an appetizer, but don't go for dinner."
0,"I just experienced again an issue I have registered several times before with Customer Svc, and never had addressed: a customer for 10 yrs, yet while watching a program on a channel for which I've paid, the program is interrupted by a screen informing me how to purchase that channel. The interruption tonight occurred during a key scene in the long-awaited Downton Abbey 4th Season premiere, and lasted long enough that I never found out what the discussion was about. NO ONE ever even addresses my complaint or inquirey regarding why this happens with various channels, all channels for which I've been paying many years. I've asked if it has to do with the cable box, but still no response. Add this to the similar complaints lodged by others about the overcharging, the fact that they allow contracted field cable svc workers to help neighbors/their friends access svcs for free in my apt complex, while I pay for those svcs, and it adds up to a real problem at times. I have found the internet svc to be pretty reliable, but no one answers my questions about why I am charged for the highest level speed of internet when I've requested information about purchasing the slower rates, esp when the cost of internet far exceeds what my employer will reimburse me for using. Oh, and when they \""improved\"" their billing format, it has made if far more difficult to understand and no one can answer questions about what some fees are about.Lots of room for improvement."
0,"While in Vegas, I wanted a really nice steak dinner. Got a $50 restaurant.com gift certificate which enticed us to choose here. Visited mid-January on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend. Had reservations at 5:30pm as we had to catch a show at 8:30pm. \n\nWe arrived right on time and were seating promptly. The hostess was neither welcoming or off putting. The restaurant was pretty busy for an early Sunday evening. \n\nIt took a long time for our waiter to come over and get us both menus and drinks. After we got our drinks, it took a full half-an-hour before he took our order. We did get the Duck Fat Fries which were heavenly. \n\nInitially, they messed up our apps and brought us an incorrect one. It wasn't until I corrected them that we our food that we ordered. We started with the Lobster Fritters and Hamachi Sashimi. I thought the fritters were alright, maybe too indulgent. The sashimi was great, huge portions. \n\nNext, I got the Kansas City Strip and my girlfriend got the Filet Mignon. My steak was less than stellar and under cooked. Her filet was good though. We also got the Potato Puree Trio, which was good but we didn't care for the horseradish ones. \n\nDessert was an Apple Crumble and Cheesecake. The crumble was delicious while the cheesecake was blah. \n\nThe whole meal took two hours, way too long in my opinion. Our waiter was very nice though but may have been overrun with too many tables. The busser was great as dirty dishes never sat and water glasses never were empty. We also had a mix up on the check, which was frustrating when time was an issue, but we got it straightened out. \n\nBill was $175 w/ tip after the gift certificate. \n\nUltimately, did I get a delicious steak dinner? No. For $175 for two, I expect way more. Especially since there are so many other steak house options in Las Vegas. While the $50 gift certificate is nice, I would pay the full $50 for a mouth watering steak, which I didn't get. Disappointment with my steak and slow service won't have me returning to Stripsteak the next time I'm in Las Vegas.\n\nNOTE: We went to Fleur the night before. Although not a steak house, if you're in Mandalay Bay, I highly recommend it over Stripsteak."
1,"One of the better Thai places I've tried in town. The restaurant is nice, clean and spacious, and the service is friendly. The menu prices are definitely a steal compared to other Thai places I've been to, and the menu choices are diverse ranging from classic curries to a variety of noodles (each with a description). \n\nWanting something healthy, I ordered the Papaya Salad- crunchy julienned green papaya, peanuts and tomatoes tossed together in a sour, sweet, and slightly spicy (level 3) vinaigrette. The vinaigrette also had fish sauce in it, so if you're not a fan of fish sauce, I'd recommend something else. On the side of the heap of papaya salad were a few pieces of cabbage. The salad was refreshing and light. My only complaints are: 1) The tomato pieces on top were mushy; and 2) I wish they added more peanuts. The peanuts added depth to the salad, and cut the vinegary-ness of the dressing. Overall, however, I enjoyed the salad very much. I also tried a bit of the Green Curry w/ brown rice which was really yummy. Spicy, but not too spicy. Sweet, but not too sweet. Just really tasty.\n\nI also am a fan of the water! They put slices of fruit (lemons, strawberries & green apples) in the water pitcher, which I thought was pretty and gave the water a nice taste. The server made sure my water glass was never empty. \n\nI definitely want to come back to try their noodle dishes (Apparently, the duck noodle soup is amazing). Good eats."
1,"Fast ,Efficient Friendly. I Fly Southwest to Las Vegas and they are the only way to go. On line check in Rocks. No Delays .Doesn't get any Better."
1,"Amazing subs- so glad they opened this location. The service is great, the food is awesome, the hot sauces are delicious, the coke machine is fun- I really enjoy eating here and I look forward to repeat visits. Every other sub place pales in comparison, except Capriotti's, but they have their own special thing going on, so I don't really compare the two.\n\nBy the way, the #10 with the Datil sauce is fantastic!! My other favorite is the #5, just as it is. YUM!"
0,"If I could give zero stars I would. They changed their scheduling policy with no notification, were extremely rude when I called to inquire about what had happened, hung up on me, the instructor left a lot to be desired, the \""hot\""\nYoga was lukewarm at best, their dress code was not on the website (if you're in anything less than a moo-moo basically they'll judge you out loud to your face, but only after the class so they get your money first), and make you pay in advance for your sessions to hold a spot. The place was clean, that was the only positive. The energy during the class was lacking, probably didn't help that there were only 10 people in there. Stay away!"
0,"At this store on Sunday, I was paying for a pair of men's running pants with a price tag of $59.99.   The clerk rang them up and said that the total was $71.  That would indicate quite a hefty tax on the item.  I questioned the total, and it turned out that the pants had rung up for $64.99, not the price on the tag.  The clerk ran a credit for the difference, but didn't volunteer that such a price discrepancy shouldn't have occurred or indicate that she would check into the matter further.  I wonder how many other people have been overcharged on this item, or will be in the future. \n\nAnother deceptive practice of this business:  I had been by the store on another occasion and had asked a salesperson about the return policy on pants I was considering buying for my husband.   She said that there was no problem, just bring them back within 30 days.  I've just looked at today's receipt, and it says that gear can be returned \""for an exchange or store credit.\""  There is no chance at all for a simple, uncomplicated return, and clerks at this store should be clear about that fact when they are asked.  On the receipt, the store claims that its return policy is \""awesome.\""   Hmm, not so much. . ."
0,"Alright, I was super excited to try Baccahanal, but it failed my expectations.  The variety of stuff was ok.  There was really nothing I went back for seconds.  I think the best thing was the tacos.  It was nice to see them making the street tacos the authentic way.  The lines were long for it but they were worth it.  The sushi was ok, not much flavor and it was the same for all the asian section.  The shrimp cocktail was ok .\n\nThe dessert section was nice, and had a lot of variety.  A lot of what I wanted was all gone and I waited a while for them to restock.  I waited maybe 20 minutes and it wasnt restocked yet so I asked one of the gals who was working the dessert section if I could have one since I saw it on the middle island.  The crepe was yummy.  The gentleman who was making the crepe was super nice and friendly.  He was making conversation with everyone while he was making the crepes. \n\nWicked spoon was so much better.  More variety and better flavors."
1,"A free event with yelpers, wine, food, and a swanky setting is like a gift!\n\nMy main goal was to celebrate turning in the first half of my comprehensive exam that day, and then to relax.  The absolute best part of the event was hanging out with various awesome yelpers and their guests, admiring Nelson Q.'s youthfulness, and meeting Donald Ziraldo.  Considering all of these people were here to admire him and his wine, he gave me a few minutes of banter (he was recruited to play NCAA football from Canada, and got drafted to the CFL) and gave me his card to visit the winery when I am in the Buffalo/Niagara area next year.\n\nI am not partial to sweet wines, but try to be open-minded.  The cocktail (icewine/vodka) was waaaaay too strong for me, so poor Paolo D. got a bit drunk at my expense.  Then, the vidal and riesling varietals - I actually liked both flavors.  The crab cakes were lukewarm but very generous with crab (and lobster I believe), and the duck spring rolls so-so.  The waitress told me they were vegetarian when I asked, but they had meat so I spit it out thinking it was pork and then found out they were duck so I ate one later.  Oy.  After that, standing around in plats and all, Eric R. and I were hungry so we bid ado to our yelp friends and went off to Grind Burger.\n\nIt was neat to visit the Trump for the first time and hear about Equifera's partnership with Kruger to bring icewine to Vegas."
1,"Awesome pizza for delivery. Top choice over pizza hut, dominos or any other pick up or delivery place. Prices are good too. They said it would be an hour but it got there in 30 min, no complaints with that."
1,"Just finished eating here and my oh my! I only have nothing but good reviews for them. I'm from CA and moved to Vegas 3 years ago and always look for the best southern food. \n\nUsually, any restaurant we go to for southern food, it can be pricey. This place has the best priced food and the quality is great!! Words cannot really explain how amazing the food is because you have to try it yourself! The service is amazing as well and they are all very nice. \n\nThis is my new go to southern food spot for sure! Thank goodness I over tipped them a little bit before I even recieved my food. They are so very welcoming! I have already referred my friends to try out this hidden little gem. I know they will not be disappointed."
1,"This mall totally saved my cheap-self in Vegas. I'm a girl who will splurge on steak dinners, show tickets, hotels, and handbags, but when it comes to breakfast and lunch I packed granola bars to avoid paying over-inflated prices on omelets. Since we stayed at the Wynn/Encore we walked across the street to this mall several times to eat lunch and stock up on booze and snacks to pre-party in our room. They've got everything from Subway and Hot Dogs to California Pizza Kitchen, sushi, burgers, and Maggianos. The ABC Store is like a heaven-sent 7-11 where we stocked up on fruit, snacks, vodka, and cranberry juice. The shopping was also very enticing. Though it doesn't have the high-high end stores that the casinos have (Chanel, etc) it does have a Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and a Neiman Marcus. They also have a HUGE Forever 21, and your run of the mill stores like GAP, Mango, and Puma if you need to pick up any basics."
1,"It took me until my fifth visit to Las Vegas to take the time to see the sign. I always figured \""Oh, I do it later\"" and never got around to it. After finally taking the time to walk the two miles from our hotel (I have no idea why we walked) I can say I've seen it. Will I see it again? Yeah, probably not... unless I somehow end up there at 3 o'clock in the morning after a night only Vegas can offer.\n\nDid you know the circles that make the word WELCOME are coins? I didn't."
0,This bar is super GHETTO!!!\nDont go
1,Best ice cream in all of Canada! I always get the mini cause it is small but just perfect. Love the vanilla-rasberry cake and ice cream! So good!
1,I've stayed here a few times already for business  and enjoy my stay each time. Havne't had a chance to use their spa yet but it looks really nice with the waterfall inside.  Have only tried eating at La Hacienda.  Margaritas there are good and the guacomole is made right there....but should save that review for La Hacienda.   Would love to bring the family here with me next time.    This hotel seems to be always busy.    Service and facilites overall were nice.
0,"Hostess is way too snotty. Menu is way too big. Servers are way too rushed (they really wanna' turn & burn your table). And food is way too pricey for what you get. Will go back if someone else reeeeeaaally wants to go, but otherwise - will feel belittled and rushed for less money somewhere else."
0,"This place used to be excellent, but they've gone downhill recently. I was a big fan of their wonton soup, especially in the winter. Was there twice in the past two weeks and both times were big disappointments. The first visit was with three friends. Service was horrible. Over one hour to get our food, and the order was completely botched. But kudos to the boss who comped two of the meals and brought a free dessert for all. But the big disappointment was yesterday's wonton soup. Terrible. Tiny wontons. Sticky noodles. Few veggies. Tasteless broth. They must have changed suppliers. Too bad. It was my favourite winter blues remedy. Hopefully they're listening."
0,"Not a fan of the potatoes, they are way too mashed and seasoned with some powder mix of sorts. The pancakes (usually a massive portion) and eggs are alright, while other additions like breakfast sausages and bacon are average. \n\nIt's a shame that this location isn't up to par with all the 'allo! mon coco' hype, I was looking forward to its opening since it's in my area and I thought it'd maybe be better than Eggspectations or Universel... but, nope."
1,"If I didn't know this restaurant existed, I would walk right past it 10 out of 10 times.  From the street, it looks even shadier than your typical South Oakland establishment but when you step inside, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  It's unique but welcoming.  My go-to favorite on the menu is the java fried rice.  It's got a bite and it's filling.   The service is super quick so you can get in and out of here on your lunch break.  I've taken 3 people from work here recently (all newbies) and they've all really enjoyed it despite being skeptical based on it's street appeal."
0,"This rating is based entirely on a recent visit, but deserved nonetheless. \n\nWhen we dined here on Sunday, my boyfriend's food was delivered by a backserver who erupted into a coughing fit as she got to our table. It was such a bad fit that she has to step outside. \n\nHaving worked in restaurants and bars for many years, I know of managements' reluctance to grant sick days. I have a feeling that this is what happened here and it is entirely unacceptable. Even if the girl didn't try to call in, she should have been sent home as soon as managers noticed her symptoms. They were very apparent.\n\nIt's disgusting and unacceptable to allow people to be around/deliver food when sick. Not to mention- it's a health code violation. As expected, my boyfriend is incredibly sick today. \n\nI have been coming here for many years because the food and service are great. I will  not be coming back again"
1,"Club Tanning was the site of my very first bed tanning experience, and I'm very happy to say that it was pretty sweet. Katie the desk girl was great, answering my hundreds of questions cheerfully and being totally helpful without attempting to sell me anything I didn't inquire about. \n   The salon itself was clean, and the prices and products were laid out very plainly. On your first visit you fill out one sheet of paperwork warning about medications that can cause a bad reaction when tanning, then you choose your desired package and are given a room number. The rooms are simple, they have an empty lotion bottle that says the room has been cleaned, a couple of towels, a pair of those little goggle things, a chair, a mirror, a fan and some headphones for your music of choice. You push a button on the wall that turns the bed on and starts your timer, then lie down or stay standing for your desired time and you're done. Clean up and leave, they'll even hold your bronzer or whatever you have if you'd like. \n   This is my first membership to a tanning salon, so I can't really compare prices, but it seems fair to me, I think unlimited tanning starts at 30 a month, or you can pay for each visit standalone. \nI know this seems a little long winded, but I went in to this totally clueless, so if you're new to tanning I completely recommend Club Tanning, the staff is helpful, the salon is clean and the whole first time process is as simple as it could be."
0,"Call before you go for dinner to see if they actually serving \""dinner\"". I arrived for dinner to be told that it was only a buffet. The wait staff was unsure 'when' or 'if' it will ever return to a regular menu for dinner. The buffet table was too short for the number of people seated in the restaurant. The line was almost out the front door to get food. As for the food- mediocre. Food seems to lose its quality when plopped into a gallon pan. The nan bread was dry and some of it was burnt. Hopefully the food would be much better served as a dinner."
1,"3.5 stars\n\nRemember when Hot Pockets were the best invention EVER? Well now there's a restaurant that is totally dedicated to a fancy hot pocket filled with tasty treats! Yup, Cornish Pasty Co!\n\nAfter promising myself that I would try this place for way too long, I decided to go with a co-worker for my first visit. For my first trip to CPC, I chose the Tikka Masala pasty. It was pretty good! I guess I was hoping for a serving of spicy, somewhat creamy, and savory tikka masala served in a hot pocket. What I got was a good hot pocket full of chicken and some sauce. Not nearly has juicy and spicy as I had imagined it would be, but still good. I chose the peanut butter and jelly pasty for a dessert to take home with me. When I got home and baked it, I took a bite and it was peanut butter and apple jelly? I was confused. It was ok.\n\nOn my second trip to CPC, I had the cheeseburger pasty. That was pretty darn good! The meat was juicy and a little grease was dripping out of the pocket, which meant that it was nice and juicy! \n\nWhenever I am tempted by a hot pocket, I make sure that I head to CPC for a well made, tasty, more sophisticated version!"
1,"This patio is one of the best around to enjoy a deluxe cocktail and the spectacular views. This is laid back hotel bar without much of a scene. I suggest you try the pretzel bites, the cheese they serve with them is mind blowing.."
1,"Ummm... the name of this place is mispelled. It's Feliz! As in Happy Taco! If you're from the South side this is what you'll call Taco Feliz...\n\nHappy Taco has been around for quite sometime and has been the best part of my late night excusions. My favorite dishes here is the Chorizo, egg & potato burrito. Also the rolled tacos are awesome! as are the regular tacos with rice & beans combination. \n\nThey have HUGE sodas and very decent prices. During \""normal\"" hours, they will always have an english speaking attendant - they may have a crazy thick accent, but they understand what you're saying. But sometimes in the middle of the night many things can get lost in translation. I love this place and their menudo is KILLER!"
0,"This place deserves 0 stars. I'm incredibly surprised that based off the reviews nothing has been done about this establishment. I came in with my friend and stood at the front counter waiting to be seated for 10 minutes. I could understand this kind of wait if they were busy, but it was silent and all we could hear standing there was the obnoxious chiming bell in the back notifying the employees that customers came in side. Even after hearing the bell repeatedly no one came to seat us. Finally a employee comes strolling out of the bathroom and her response is \""oh, no one seated you\""? Finally she walks us to our seat and hands us menus telling us our waiter will be with us soon. So we sat for a few more minutes  and heard a few employees talking about customers behind us. Our waiter finally appears walks by our table shrugs and says \""ehh I'll get them in minute\"". We instantly decided to leave because it was apparent this restaurant didn't want our money. As we got in the car I looked in side to see 3 employees at the front counter all smiling and talking about the fact that we left. \n\nDrove a few miles down to the IHOP on power where we were seated right away and had great customer service. Our waiter here was actually professional. Even watched him help an elderly woman out side."
0,"Paid 700 dollars for massages with Jerry costa and after he secured payment he became very moody because i wanted tues, wed. back to back massages and to focus on the lower body. He wanted to do it his way. It's my money, and i layed out my terms to begin with. Won't return calls or money. Thief."
1,"I LOVE Town Square!  There has never been a trip to Vegas without a visit here.  The BEST H&M hands down I've ever been to--better than the 3 story  club-like monster H&M at Caesars everyone loves so much.  You can't even hear your own thoughts there.  Town Squares so much better, and easy to get in and out.\nAlso my fave Sephora because the girls are so friendly....\nFrancesca's isn't as crowded and jammed in either so theres more space to actually breath and shop, sometimes I have panic-attacks in the other Francesca's.\n\nPlus Town Square is super clean and pretty so it's a much better experience than the crazy-town casino malls:)"
0,"This place is a joke. I should've known from the start with the  V8 salsa that I should've spent my lunch hour and money elsewhere. The \""veggie\"" burrito only has lettuce, tomatos and rice - oh, and V8 sauce on top. If you want a REAL veggie burrito... go to Loco Lime in Huntersville. Best Mexican cuisine I've had in a long time. I was unable to give less than 1 star for this place, by the way."
0,"absolutely horrible prices. 2 eggs biscuits and gravy hashbrowns, bacon and coffee $14.73\nyou gotta be kidding. eggs overcooked ridiculous hash browns, burnt coffee ( dont even bring spoon, swizzle straw from bar). water tasted like it came out of rusty pipes, gravy had horrible tase like they made it with sage or rosemary.bacon cold and limp never offered refill on coffee. wont return. can get better elsewhere and a lot less  $"
1,Went to Merkato last Friday. Ordered the salmon dish with rice and injera bread. Good meal! Good price! Big portions too! Better than the Abyssinia restaurant! I will be back! :)
0,"The worst customer service in the pharmacy, to transfer a prescription it has taken me six phone calls and three trips down to the pharmacy, on top of them not knowing what is going on they are rude and ignorant! The only reason I changed is because my insurance changed, looks like I need to find a new pharmacy because this one will not work for me."
0,"Meh... the only reason I even stepped foot into Rock Bottom is because I had a lunch meeting and it was at the suggestion of my dining companion. I used to go to Rock Bottom in Atlanta every now and then and it was ok... especially if you go for beer / happy hour.  I going to be blunt here right now though:  this place sucks!\n\nLuckily, I enjoyed the company of those that I dined with, otherwise, it would've been a miserable experience!  Thanks for that, Miranda and Ken (if you happen to read this!)  \n\nI had their cobb salad and it was pretty average although the turkey in it was nasty.  Our waitress was slow as hell.  The atmosphere (keep in mind we were there for lunch) was nothing special.  Rock Bottom is the reason that I'm not big on chains.  I don't think I'll be returning.  Even if I'm stuck at Desert Ridge, there are plenty of other dining options that are far superior to Rock Bottom (CPK, Yardhouse, Rubios, and more).\n\nSorry, RB - had to do it..."
1,"This restaurant has some of the best Indian in town. Their samosas are obviously homemade, and their chicken tikka is so good. My husband loves the hot vindaloo, with chicken. We take out from here all the time!"
0,"Had dinner here the other night for my birthday.  I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air.  So we decided to try Benihana's.  \n\nUnfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke.  His \""performance\"" was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat!  The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty.  You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold.  They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats.  They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls.\n\nThey also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out.  This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for."
1,"This has been my home church for about 2 1/2 years now. My kids (high school and jr.high) love the youth ministry! This place really is phenomenal at making members feel like they're surrounded by family, and newcomers feel like they're in a warm but non-threatening environment."
0,Service was great but food was disappointing. Pork belly was too greasy and my short ribs were way too sweet. Mashed parsnips were sickly sweet with an odd aftertaste. The fries with the lamb burger had a strange texture. I don't think they used the right potatoes. \n\n I really wanted to love this place from all the great reviews but am truly left disappointed.
0,i just recently called to enquire about calories and the person who answered (a guy) was very rude. first he could not make a estimation about how much calories are in the plate. when i explained to him while talking politely make an estimation of how much calories was in a small plate vs. a large plate the person rudely hung up. he could have given me a number and it would have been all good but now i decided not to go there.
0,"Tired of going through the drive thru, ordering what I do and getting something totally different by the time I get home. Has happened more then three times in the last 6 months. I don't get as to how hard it is to get an order right.  I have spoken to the manager and called and they just don't seem to care. They fill like you are trying to get a free meal out of them. And you know what? They should give me a free meal for always screwing up my order.. Frustrated! YES I AM darn it."
1,"While staying in Scottsdale my husband and I invited a couple who had never eaten Korean food to join us for dinner at Hodori.   \n\nWe started off with seafood pancake as an appetizer.  The pancake tasted good; however, it did not have enough seafood in it. The next one we ordered was japche, which had great flavor.   Main dishes were grilled Kalbi and spicy saut\u00e9ed octopus.  Kalbi tasted great.  \n\nEveryone enjoyed the great flavor of the spicy octopus that was cooked in cabbage and onions.  But I should have ordered squid instead.  Even though the flavor was great the octopus was a little chewy.  Our friends also learned to make a lettuce wrap and enjoyed it very much.  \n\nOverall, good food and good service."
1,"Easy stop off the highway for cheese of all kinds, jerky, beer, gifts and souvenirs. Cheese Curds are a must, and are available in a variety of flavors. We chose Cajun, but there are also the classics: plain yellow or white, or a mix of the two. We also purchased a \""beer cheese.\"" The staff is super friendly and more than willing to let you try any samples you'd like. There were some great cheese spreads we tried, too. I especially liked the Port Wine...reminded me of grandma's house, and the Horseradish.\n\nWe each had a sandwich and enjoyed them! I opted for hard salami with the house Mousehouse Jack. It was nice and toasty, melty, and delicious. D got a Reuben. The House Sauce was particularly stand-out. \n\nOh, and of course the fudge was too tempting to pass up. Thank goodness we don't live in Wisconsin. We'd be as big as houses...and not Mousehouses either."
0,Crust was doughy and where were the toppings??  Will never it Papa John's again.  YUCK!!!!
0,"Do you come here often? This old line would definitely work here. Great for families or old marrieds looking to get out of the house and laugh-out-loud for a few hours. This place is a brightly colored, entertainingly, loud, home away from home, covered in unexpected but, laughtasticly humorous saying that creatively remind you of where you are.\n\nI have been here a few times in the past, with friends, unsually during the day (Day drinking, as their shirts say). So, the other Saturday night I decided to head over after some strenuous solo christmas shopping. Looking to relax, refuel, drink, flirt and..... (nevermind, it didn't happen anyways). I parked near the Greenfield side and walked up to what I thought was the main door. But, it was locked! The thought crossed my mind that they may be closed? But, the loud music led me around the corner to the chill-friendly security door check who informed me that they serve food until 2am and wished me a good time. As I made my way inside the place was pretty busy on the patio, with a live DJ, no seats left at the bar, and absolutley no one but staff on the inside, I guess that was their intention.\n\nI found a nice spot (with great viewing) on a corner table in the patio area, far too big for just myself, but who knows, the night was still young... Within seconds, my server was at my table taking my drink order and right back to take my food order (Ugh, I MUST have looked famished! Or he's just that good?) He was back over in a few minutes with my chips and salsa and appologized that the food would be taking longer than normal. I thanked him and told him it was no problem, as I was in no hurry. \n\nAs I waited I finally had a chance to really look around. I have to admit, I was quite surprised to see so many regular farmer, construction types had filled the place with their jealous polential wife types (just the feeling I got). It reminded me of my visits to the NW! I guess I'll have to make an appearance at this place more often! I felt like the best looking thing to happen to this place in awhile and I was totally cas in jeans and sneakers! It was a little surreal! Although the stinky eye lady glances in my general direction were getting a bit annoying (...remember, corner table seat.) I wanted to say: Ladies, PUHLEASE, I am NOT looking at your man! ...I am simply trying to lip read Joe Rogan's mouth for the details of the UFC fight. (the other best looking thing in the place, besides me. Yeah, it was one of THOSE nights) Sheesh! But, they would have never heard me over the DJ beats and the cornhole game happening in the walk way. \n\nJust then, my food arrived. Luckily, I had asked them to make it to go. I had read the handy yelp reviews on this Supergooeycheese chimi thingy and Man! This thing did not dissappoint! I dug right into it! Fully loaded and super flavorful! It has this amazing smelling/ tasting jalapeno cream sauce and ?lbs of cheese I asked the servicer, but I forgot (lost in the deliciousness) he smiled as he explained, knowing exactly what I was experiencing. It actually got better with every overloaded mouth full! Quarterway through I paused just long enough to realize I was already stuffed! But, by that time I was pretty much done with the discomfort of the corner seat with a 'greeat' view.\n\nOverall, a great place to take the fam to get out of the house for a nightlife atmosphere with generous sized portions of food and not have to dirty your own kitchen. Buuut, not the best place to go for a 'meeting' or a friendly conversation with strangers."
1,"This is the second oil change I've gotten from this place. Friendly staff and prompt service brought me back. I like that the guys here seem trustworthy and that they aren't trying to sell me a bunch of stuff I don't need. Mike, one of the technicians is super friends and helpful! I'll be back for sure!"
0,"Ok so to start the food is actually really good and consistent. The reason i rated them lower is because of the customer service. I have been several times and usually have good service, however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian, prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion, there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait, so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian, both saw us and continued working, one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is \""How are you planning to pay?\"" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money, we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded, \""i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments.\"" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu) . After we go that worked out, she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders, requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order, unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier, i placed my order over the phone as a to go order, that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there, i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective. Overall I think they could improve their customer service, especially for seating. I typically wait about 5 minutes and every time i have gone it has always been between 2% and 25% full."
1,"Love everything about it. Seriously, from the location, parking, cute decor and fabulous service.... Two thumbs up.\n\nI read the yelp reviews before making an appointment and they were spot on. I ask for Randi because I read that she does great color and styles, but to be honest, all the other reviewers said the same about the other stylists.\n\nIt's true though. I just left my second appointment with Randi and couldn't be happier. I wanted to go more than once just to make sure it was consistently a great experience before I left glowing reviews.\n\nShe listens, discusses and nails it. I am super happy with the style and even happier now with the color. I come in with pics to mix and match looks from and she brings it all together. Not to mention, fun to talk to and an enjoyable atmosphere with the other stylists too.\n\nDefiantly recommend Randi and the salon!"
1,"What a great place.  Amazing food (Skirt Steak and Sea Bass!), beautiful service ( Thanks Crystal!) and all in a beautiful place.  PS- Don't let the menu scare you off as spicy as it reads.  There is something here for everyone.  Very great restaurant!"
1,"Addicted.  Pure, organic, cold pressed, no BS.  The stores are very nice and so are the staff.  I only wish it wasn't so pricey, I don't really understand the $$ rating here.  Won't keep me from going back though :)"
0,Incredibly unresponsive - I can never get a hold of TKS Handyman Service.  This is the second time I've needed something repaired at my place and both times I've left messages and called multiple times - never a response.
1,Best repair shop I have ever seen was drunk and dropped my phone close to the strip even called a cab
1,"I know how a poor Islamic Pilgrim feels when they pray at Mecca now. \n\nThis Majestic wonderland is split into two significant sections: a fairly casual bar area with numerous flat-screens and an amazing amount of taps. Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously, I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision.\nThe other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting, high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit.\nThe food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good.\nService was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens.\nOne excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there, wherever it might be. \nI hope that my fellow motorists, my family, and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley. I do not believe in drinking and driving but I was pretty damn close to finding a homeless person to drive me home.\n\nPLEASE PUT THE NEXT ONE IN THE SOUTHWEST ITS A LOVELY PART OF THE VALLEY WITH LOTS OF GROWTH AND TERRIBLE BARS. THANK YOU."
1,"We were visiting for 2 nights and really wanted sushi.  So I did my trusty Yelp search and came upon Social House, now located in the Crystals shopping area at GORgeous City Center.\n\nUpon first visual the place is just as stunning looking as the mall. It was dark, sexy, and filled with pretty people. We settled in at the bar and ordered some martinis.  Our bartender was an uber sexy Asian gal wearing a corset. My husband says I need to start wearing corsets too :)\n\nWe started with cucumber sunomono and a couple specialty sushi rolls. One roll was kalbi beef, the other was vegetarian. Loved both of these.  The kalbi was slightly crispy from a quick frying. The vegetarian was filled with a nice bit of cream cheese. Next we tried the Himachi specialty roll and the spicy scallop roll. Again, these were spot on. The spicy scallop came with a yummy sauce that could've been eaten alone!\n\nThe rolls had 6 pieces each. Just enough to fill our tummies and continue on with our night, without feeling too bloated. And they weren't over-the-top expensive either. I think the highest one was $12.\n\nDrinks we're sexy-delish, atmosphere was sexy-cool, service was sexy-attentive, and food was sexy-yum!"
0,"The ice cream here tastes old and funny.  That semi-melted, semi-freezer burnt almost gooey and just plain old wrong texture.  One bite and I tossed it out.  The store is filthy.  The customer service is horrible.  Save yourselves and go to the gelato place down the road, or better yet inside one of the many stores that line Sahara or Charleston and grab a pint of Ben and Jerry's."
1,"Fast, friendly service and the same high quality ingredients you'll find at any Chipotle. We were here on a limited time schedule for lunch, and we were in and out with plenty of time to spare!"
0,I ordered delivery at 5:10 pm. She called me back to verify my address at 5:12 pm. I called at 6:00 pm and asked where my food was. She replied with we haven't had 1 single delivery order all day. I said that's impossible and told her the above story. She then asked me if I ordered from another location.  I told her I'm calling the number in which one of the associates called me from. Placed on hold. Then when she got back on phone  she told me her new cashier didn't put the order in the computer so she'll comp one of the items. \n\nYes. 1 item.  \n\nFood gets here the total is 23.00 I give him 30.00 and what do you know... The driver doesn't have change. \n\nI ordered 3 items. 2 hot pastas and 1 salad. The salad was on the bottom of the Luke warm pastas. \n\nThe food ...  Had little to no flavor and paired well with a warm soggy salad. \n\nOh btw you also can't use your free breadsticks coupon for delivery.
1,Whenever I go to Vegas... This place is as must for me!! I love their beef jerky and sticky rice!!!! So the 5 stars is only for that. If I start reviewing the other entrees.... Stars will be less :( Anywhos the beef jerky is the bomb!!! If you'r e hungry find another place... But for late late night snack and something light...order their jerky and their humongous to-go cup thai ice tea ;)
0,What a dump! Messy messy. Stale food. Sloppy employees. WTF Taco Bell?!?! Someone please clean this place up.
0,"We've been to Battista's before but it's been a while.  As last night was our friends birthday and she wanted to go there, we figured it would be great to go back. \""Aye Carumba\"", what the heck happened to this place.\nThe place was jam packed with people and took forever to be seated because, unless your whole party is present, they won't seat you even with a reservation.  Once we got seated, it was a quick explanation of the menu and if we needed any time to order.  We ordered our food and \""Wham-O\"", our food was there immediately.  We had Chicken Cacciatore and Veal Parmigiana as our main course.  The chicken was dry and the veal was thin & fatty.  The sauces were thin and seemed watered down.  At the end of our meals, the server, who had the personality of a wet mop, immediately threw down the check without asking if we needed anything else or if we wanted dessert.  It would have been a shame because the Cannoli, which wasn't the best, was the best part of this meal.  We also ordered a side of sausage, which were thin sliced pieces covered in a pasty tomato sauce for $8.50!  \nParking sucked!! It was a nightmare to get there, the parking lot is small and they park limos right in front of the entry making it impossible to get by.  We had to park at a nearby hotel and walk to the restaurant.\nI don't know if the original owners are involved or even care about the place anymore but it SUCKED!!  Obviously, they are only catering to tourists and their past history.  I can't see how locals would keep going there with so many other good Italian restaurants in town.\nUnfortunately, we will never be back there again.  I'd rather remember the past good times there than the feeling like I just ate at a Furr's Cafeteria!"
0,"Decent food. Pretty good drinks. Reasonable prices. Horrible service.\n\nPros: The burger and fries were good enough to warrant a return trip. The beer selection was pretty good. Couldn't complain about the drink prices. The manager was pretty helpful, and gave me an industry discount (I'm a bartender) when he brought the check.\n\nCons: Absolutely the worst service I've had in years, by far! We sat down on the patio, where most of the other guests were, for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped. He got us some water and sent the server over. He took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks. We didn't see him again for quite a long time. I was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one. Every time the waiter was at our table, it was because the manager had told him to go there. \n I had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and I no longer had any interest in staying. Once again, the manager handled the situation very well (sending the waiter over and discounting the bill). After we had the bill, the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed. He was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book. It was really uncomfortable.  The moment the book closed, the waiter had it in his hands. He ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip. (as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15% even for crappy service. this service warranted $1 however.) \n Nobody expects incredible service in a bar. It's a real laid-back place. I do expect some service though. It is, after all, why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar, but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad, he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot, but I will be sitting at the bar if i do. The server in question was a tall red-haired male.\n \n i really liked the beer I had there too. I wish I could have bought 10 more. If only there was someone to serve them to me."
1,I love this place! Healthy food and fun ambiance. The watermelon black tea is delicious and the shrimp protein bowl with brown rice is my go to!
0,"I hate to write a bad review on a \""Mom & Pop\"" store, but this experience got me so upset that I'm taking 15 minutes out of my night to make sure that it doesn't happen to you!\n\nI was craving Korean food but didn't want to haul my butt all the way to Las Vegas since I live in Henderson.  (Next time, I will!)  I recall eating at Jun's Korean Restaurant a year ago and the bulgogi and spicy squid were decent.  Since my mom wanted to eat some spicy squid too but didn't want to dine out, I decided to order \""Take Out\"" -- which was a HUGE mistake!  So, I ordered bulgogi for my son, spicy squid for mom and spicy soft tofu soup with beef for moi.  \n\nWhen I ordered over the phone, the lady never took my name.  I thought that was odd so I said, \""Don't you need my name?\""  She said, \""That's ok. We have your phone number\"" -- Caller ID, I suppose that's what she meant.  When I got there, there was only 1 customer in the store.   I went up to the counter and said I have a \""to go order.\""  I literally repeated my whole order to her since she had a blank look on her face.  Suddenly, the light bulb went off and she reached out to two bags and gave me the total amount to pay...$30+.  Since the place was pretty dead and there were only one other togo bag, I made the mistake of NOT DOUBLE CHECKING my order, tipped her a couple of bucks and left.  \n\nWhen I got to Mom's, you can only imagine how baffled I was to find \""Spicy pork saute with kimchee and tofu\"".  Huh?!  Where's the squid?!  I was pissed 'cause I was so looking forward to that for Mom so I made a phone call to Jun's.  The same lady answered the phone and she basically argued with me that I ordered the kimchee pork and she knows nothing about the squid. Wow!  She didn't even apologize or try to make amends -- and I knew I was wasting my time so I just hung up.  Mom was disappointed but we gave the \""new\"" dish a try since we were hungry.  If you like pork and kimchee, I guess you'll like the dish.  We just prefer our kimchee as a \""side\"" dish -- not an entree, thank you very much.  \n\nSad to say, the soup was horrible!  It was bland... it tasted like kim chee water ... not kidding!  The tofu was the only thing that was edible.  The menu said \""soft tofu with beef and vegetable\"" ... um,... \""Where's the Beef?!\""  The better description would be: \""soft tofu with a strand of beef and kim chee and we just pour water over the kim chee and call it soup\"".  To make the night worse, after my 3rd bite, I looked closer and WTF?!!  Am I seeing a strand of hair?!  (YEP!  It sure is!  GROSS!!!!!!)  I was no longer hungry and decided that I'll boycott this place!    \n\nNeedless to say, Mom and I were sadly disappointed by Jun's.  The One Star given is because my son ate the bulgogi.  I asked him if he enjoyed the dish and he said, \""There's no hair in mine.  It's definitely better than yours and grandma's!\""  Haha!  He's a funny kid!\n\nI guess there'll be NO \""next time\"" here.  If I have a craving for Korean food in the future, I'll make the drive to Spring Mountain.  This experience totally ruined it for me!  Sorry Jun!"
0,"I am not impressed. The pizza, garlic knots, meatballs zeppole were decent, but nothing to write home about. \n\nThe worst part was the spaghetti and meatballs dinner I ordered. I asked for sauce on the side, which they did. But they gave me a minuscule portion of spaghetti (not even enough for a child's portion IMO and it was hard and had obviously been sitting. There was literally more sauce than pasta. \n\nThe side salad with grilled chicken is $3 more than without, so I assumed they must give a decent sized piece of chicken with it. You know what they say when you assume, right? There was maybe half a cutlet's worth or pre-frozen, microwave grilled chicken (think McDonald's kind) on it. \n\nSo all in all, I paid almost $20 ($12 for the spaghetti and $7 for the salad) for what amounts to a child's portion of food (half of which was inedible). We got the food maybe 30 minutes before closing, so when I called to let them know I figured we could just work it out next time (we were happy with everything else) but the phone just rang and rang. We will definitely go somewhere else next time."
1,We are visiting and so excited to have found the Street.  I am a big fan of the bob smoothie.  I have been here two days and have had a boba smoothie every day.  Delicious.
0,"Disappointing. \nService (just the server) was middle of the road to poor. Expected a lot more from a Thomas Keller place. \nOysters were good. Server forgot oyster forks and a bowl. Brought them after we asked. \nPate was off the charts good. \nFoie gras was bland. Some of the worst I've ever had. Wtf? Tasteless and like refrigerated lard. Lacked the wonderful textures and nuanced flavor that good foie gras has. Sigh.\n\nMy friend's fish was on the bland side. Or uninspired. Lacking something. My pork short ribs were really tasty, but both of our entrees were on the just barely warm side. More Wtf. \nDessert order was taken. Server returned to explain they were out of the one my friend ordered. Ok. I know it happens. Just added to the sense that the server wasn't paying attention. Dessert was dropped and table hadn't been marked (no silverware).  Another server noticed and brought us silverware.\n\nThe back server (or busboy if you must call him that, though you ought not to) however: Amazing. This guy was on top of everything he could be expected to be from start to finish. HE was what we expected from the place. Changed plates, checked on us (when the server was off schmoozing the table of hot ladies next to us (yeah, I get it, they're hot and we're just a couple of guys, but we're ordering well and aren't you just the least bit aware of the difference in service you're providing our two tables when we're right next to each other and we can SEE it??).... oh wait, I was talking about how great the back server was... Right. He was great. Crumbed. Refilled. Fast. Expedient. Made us feel at the least... cared about? Noticed? Something like that.\n\nLower than average overall experience.\n\nPalmed the back server cash on the way out. 20% to the server because you do. And sadly, wouldn't  go back."
1,Brenda revamped my whole look with swift precision and dauntless commitment to her vision of my hair.  I went from a bleached out blond to a natural highlighted platinum sophisticate.  I recommend Brenda at Hair Touch Studio for any correction or color/skin matching hair processing.
0,"I went on a Sunday afternoon. The food was below expectations as compared to the other Chinese food in the area. For some reason the heating trays were set to high and I burned my hand on the steam rising between the entree platters. The selection is poor, bland, and did not seem to be changed out after getting old. The basics (orange chicken, beef and broccoli) were okay. Sushi bar looked weird. The interior is old and worn. Wait staff wore dirty clothes. Children were playing in the dining area and seemed to be the employees children."
1,"I've walked by this place a lot & it's always packed with Asians (a good sign if you like really good food). Slid in on Memorial Day for a quick lunch & had the beef scallion pancake, fried dumplings & a lemon tapioca smoothie. There was only one server there taking care of everything (host, server, & busser) & she was very attentive, polite, patient, & helpful to a newbie like me. Smoothie came quickly followed by food & all were excellent. Scallions & dumplings were crisp & delicious, & drinking lemon tapioca ice through a big straw is a very cool experience. It was a small meal & I left feeling not thoroughly satisfied but vowed to return.\n\nA week later, I ordered 3 vegetable spring rolls, spicy short ribs w/ rice & a kiwi smoothie, & this time left with a belly about to burst. Spring rolls were fresh & hot (but not too hot) & just hit the spot. Ribs, I abandoned the chopsticks with, & ate them like I was at KFC #FingerLickinGood, & I experienced brain freeze on my Kiwi ice. \n\nI haven't been back since but will never forget the experience."
0,"We walked in and the place was empty except for one other couple. The hostess/waitress was vacuuming and then mopping the entire place while we were there. They close in an hour. Could it wait until your customers are gone? Finally, the waitress/hostess/ poor woman cleaning was sick as a dog! She was coughing while she vacuumed, coughing while she mopped and coughing while she brought out our food! She should not be serving food to customers let alone working! She was very sweet and we felt bad for the review but she should be in bed. Food was fine but if it comes with a cold..... Yuck!"
1,"If they had a 3.5 star this would be my review, I still think they're a lil' pricey/precious on their drinks, but MAN is the food good..even the salads are killer...and I thought MACS did the best beef brisket I'd ever had til I tried this brisket....seriously so tender you can cut w/some slight pressure with a fork....\n\noddly the meat i think is not great is their BBQ itself....it tastes like its been soaking in a bottle of Liquid Smoke, just WAY WAY too smokey/pungent...i know u want smokehouse flavor but this is overkill....but everything else is really really good"
1,"Best theater in vegas, just have to sneak in ur four loco's lol they have the huge seats that you might not want to leave and the staff is amazing"
1,"This place was the answer to my prayers, since I am currently shopping for upcoming birthdays and want to send packages featuring Arizona-sourced goodies. Thanks to Yelp (and Gabi M.'s review, in particular), Poppa Maize \""popped\"" up on my radar and fit the bill beautifully for my needs.\n\nThis tiny storefront is packed with a dazzling variety of flavored popcorn and an array of packaged choices. I stuck with the $3 (medium) bags and collected a rainbow of flavors. For myself, I grabbed Cheesy Chipotle and Candy Bar Caramel. These didn't sit long at home before I succumbed to the urge to munch! For gifts, I selected Pineapple-Jalape\u00f1o, Cheese & Bacon, and Cookies & Cream. Unfortunately, they didn't have any German Chocolate Cake popcorn in the inventory, but I am dying to try that concoction should it reappear in the future.\n\nWhat was most notable was how friendly the service was. I mentioned that I was trying to shop for locally-sourced items and was offered a copy of the November 2009 Phoenix magazine which featured a compendium of Mom & Pops and local businesses. Not only did this help me with my birthday-shopping research, but also made me feel better about my quest. According to Phoenix magazine (who cites Local First Arizona), \""When you shop at locally owned businesses, your money is recirculated and creates up to 75 percent more tax revenue to our community and state.\""\n\nCall it my way of battling the Great Repression and certain anti-Arizona boycotts that are unfairly damaging this great state's economic health. Aaah, sweet (and savory) economic justice! Crunch... crunch!"
1,OMG! Great food! The collard greens and black eyed peas were better than I grew up with!  No main entr\u00e9e is even necessary. .. I got the fried chicken and my wife got the ribs.  Each entr\u00e9e comes with 3 sides.  My wife got the fried cabbage and Mac and cheese (e both got the greens).  I'm not a big Mac and cheese lover but couldn't help but steal a few bites of hers. Simply awesome! \nBest fried chicken in Vegas hands down!  The ribs were also good. ..\nGood service with nice kids serving.  The young man that waited on us had a real passion for the food and it showed in his body language and words. \nDumbstruck going back soon!  Next is the catfish.  Saw it on a customers table.  Looked amazing! That customer was very happy!
0,"So here's my gripes with the home delivery:\n\nThe AZ Republic website promises home delivery M-F by 5:30 am, Sat by 6:00 am, and Sunday by 6:30 am.  I have yet to receive this timely service; most days it is 7:30 am before the paper is thrown on my driveway. When I call Cust Service to complain, they always say that there are things that are out of the delivery person's control such as printing delays, weather, etc etc.....but EVERY DAY?!  I suspect my delivery person is sleeping in every morning and getting to the deliveries when he feels like it.\n\nMost days the paper is thrown either under the car, or else barely even on my driveway, sometimes in the street gutter where rain/sprinkler runoff turns the paper into a wet mess.  Again when I complain, it improves for a few days and then back to the same situation. I'm tired of fishing it out from under the car with a broom handle, or laying the paper out to dry before I can read it.\n\nI apparently can't get this delivery person's performance to improve, or even transfer my delivery to a different delivery person, so I have to put up with the same crappy service.  They have just lost a 23-year customer!"
0,"The food is good, not excellent.  Stay away feom getting your food delivered, you will wait 1.5 hours and every time they will forget at least half your order. If the kitchen is this understaffed,  hire more people. I will NEVER order from here again because the last 3 times the service was late, they forgot half the order and its just not worth it."
1,"I have to preface this by saying I went here years and years ago, and want to go back to see if the quality has held.  A colleague and I were in Montreal for a conference, and I heard the concierge tell a hotel guest about it.  The lobster, mango and avocado salad was excellent, and we chose to go back for three consecutive nights until we had to leave town, and, sadly, Restaurant Julien."
1,Went back for round 2 and again Sunny was awesome and friendly.
1,"Been wanting to try here for awhile and finally had a chance during Arizona Restaurant Week. My wife and I were both satisfied with our meals. The Stetson salad is as good as advertised!  Due to the couscous base, we had leftover that we were able to eat the next day. My wife had the short ribs which were very tender. I had the lamb lollipops which were okay but I'd probably get something else if I went back. The restaurant is pretty expensive so thats a definite drawback for a return visit. Service was very good!"
0,"I don't own a Costco membership. I'm mooching off my cousin who has an extra card and looks like me.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I like that Costco carries some pretty cool items like paper shredders (yes..flashback to Modern Family Season 1).  We bought a great shredder here and might I say we have prevented identity theft thus far :) Costco has a great price on their organic spinach boxes, their wine and alcohol selection and pricing is decent and they have some items I use like Boursin cheese, Fage yogurt etc at decent prices.  Oh, most of all their environmentally friendly Kirkland detergent is really the bomb, That's really the reason I keep my cousin's Costco card in my wallet.\n\nNow from my gripes:\n\nI get seriously irritated when I see severely obese people buying industrial sized packages of full fat cheese, trays of butter croissants and bulk bags of chocolates. I don't think anyone needs that much food unless they are feeding a very unhealthy school. Costcos are full of such irresponsible behavior. But I guess it's a personal choice on what you consume but hey, I'm paying part of their medical bills with my hefty taxes! Before I digress too much...back to the issue at hand...\n\nThis Costco is ridiculously busy at all times of the day and the lines are crazy. So for someone like me who's buying detergent, it's about a 45 minute process to find parking, walk to the detergent aisle and check out. \n\nGenerally, I can't get behind the idea of Costco because I would never purchase 4 watermelons at a go or a gallon tub of potato salad. Buying what I need from Trader Joe's/Sunflower is plenty for me and it affords me variety in my daily meals since I don't have to (let's say)use up a giant bag of dumplings.\n\nYes, I patronize Costco once every 6 months or so but I don't think I'll ever be getting a membership or crying my eyes out if they happen to disappear."
0,"The two stars are for service only.  Otherwise, the food does not get stars at all.  What have you done, Haus Murphy???  I've been coming to this restaurant since before it moved to its current location.  I lived in Germany for nearly 4 years, and the food was amazing.  I found Haus Murphy when I moved here and was overjoyed that the Schnitzel was very close to the \""real\"" Schnitzel in Pruem, GE.  But, someone has gotten hold of the ingredients.  Perhaps the quality and pride in the food got lost somewhere in all the times the restaurant has changed hands.  They have either decided to cut back on good, quality ingredients, or just don't care anymore.  My last two visits left me wanting.  As another reviewer put it, the food used to be really good, but now it's \""meh.\""  The only good part of the meal was the mushroom demi glace.  THAT was really good, and covered up the blandness of the dish.  The portions have really been cut back, as well.  Tiny bit of potatoes.  No bread basket anymore, unless you pay for it (way too much money), and the dessert was bland and too gooey.  Strudel crust is supposed to be flaky and crisp!   Service was excellent., however.  We sat on the patio, and some moron allowed his two little daughters to run up and down the patio, screaming and dodging in and out of the tables and wait staff.  One waiter was terrorized by these brats, as he had to swerve several times to avoid colliding with them.  He was nearly tripped with full plates in his hands, but never changed his expression.  Just carried on.  (People, please teach your children how to behave in a restaurant!! )  I know we won't be going back.  Husband was NOT happy with the amount of the bill compared to the unremarkable food.   I'm sad."
1,"I came here with my company~ I fell for their pure pressure when I initially didn't plan to join them after work. Now I'm hooked. :)\n\nIt's a prefix menu of 6 courses.. I think. I was quite tipsy ^^  I don't know what each plate consist of but it all taste pretty darn amazing. Each plate is so unique in taste.. like, it's crazy. lol.. never knew taste like that existed! Same time we are being entertained with a gorgeous belly dancer who comes out to dance all around every 30 mins or so. Bonus stars to that. \n\n\nI'll be back. Definitely great for groups."
0,"We went to Mimi's because other times the food and service has been exceptional.  This time however the server was rude and seemed not to care about us at all!  She walked away abruptly before we had completely given her our order.  When my food arrived it was not correct.  Instead of offering to make it correct she argued with me about \""that's always the way it comes out.\""  When I mentioned to her that it was not what had been stated on the menu she said that she would have to get the manager.  By the time he came over we were half way through our meal.  A replacement meal for me meant that I would be eating alone and my family would be sitting there with nothing to do.  Another point of contention: As we were waiting for the waitress to come take our order we could hear the manager correcting her for something - loudly!  Very UN-professional to correct an employee where guests can hear.  It made us all very uncomfortable!  It will take quite a lot for me to consider going back to this Mimi's!  When a restaurant doesn't really take care of its guests it is a sure sign they don't want my money.  There are plenty of mediocre restaurants around - I want one that is great!"
0,"We know the FOX is clever, the restaurant concepts they come up with are like little magical yellow bricks down the yellow brick road that is lead by the Peter Piper and when one opens, people gather.\nI love the concept of the Yard, group seating, plenty of games to play . . . and there were plenty of groups there.  \nNow I know FOX is deft and any restaurant is all about maximizing the potential for the almighty drinks and serving of food.  \nUnfortunately, at the Yard, service of food and drinks failed miserably.  There were a large group of us Elite Yelpers there with our friends celebrating some Dec. birthdays . . . yet, there weren't enough seating and I seriously stood there for almost 2 hours and not ONCE did a waiter come by and ask me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  And I was more than ready to order something to eat and drink!!!\nAll those potential loss of revenue I saw all around me.  I'm thinking, \""if they would do the order and deliver system differently, the nightly intake would certainly double if not more!\""\nI don't know what the solution is, but if I were FOX, I would send someone FOXY and brainy to spend some time to analyze the situation and come up with a procedure where the plentiful patrons are serviced because at the end of the day, you are still running a restaurant and not a free playground for the grownups."
1,"I was really impressed with this place.  Cozy atmosphere and decent drink deals during happy hour.  We had the bean dip (great), I had quesadillas with gouda (pretty good) and my friend got the tomatillo salad, which she hated but was my favorite thing on the table.  Food was fresh and the recipes were good.  Would give it 5 stars if the service was a bit better."
1,Food was good and reasonably priced. Service was excellent.  Pasta was a little oily for my taste.
0,"we wound up here last night after finding 40+ minute wait times at every dining establishment on the square. the host said 10-15 and we were starving, so we got beers and waited. \n\nI am not a fan of capital beers, but decided to try a dark anyway... and it was a letdown, just like every other capital brewery beer I've had. I will never understand why people love these mediocre beers so much, but I digress.\n\nwe were seated and our waitress was great- fast and friendly, and the only reason this review is getting two stars instead of one. we ordered some cheese curds to share and they looked normal, but tasted burned. and my blue cheese burger, the one that sounded so delicious on the menu? the pretzel roll was burned, and the burger itself was devoid of flavor. \n\nas if all that weren't bad enough, they were playing some awful new country the entire time. yuck.\n\nif you aren't picky about your beer, food or music, this might be your place."
0,They canceled a hentai showing event. No me gusta!! Don't allow that to happen again.
1,"Lucky kitchen may look like a dive on the outside but inside it is clean and the food is amazing, just as a real Chinese person would eat. Yummy. And the prices are unbeatable epically for the portion size."
1,"Whether you're studying or out on a date with a significant other, I would definitely recommend Honey Bake Shop.\n\nIt's a very cozy and quaint bakery/caf\u00e9 in the heart of Uptown Waterloo. The cupcakes are to die for (would recommend the Chocolate Coconut) and if you get half a dozen or more, they come packaged in a cute box.\n\nWill be back soon."
1,You have to try the Steak Tataki. It is absolutely amazing!!
1,"My best advice to you is to get yourself down to Vietnam House now, immediately, before word gets out, it gets busy, prices go up and it moves to a larger premises, which would diminish it's perfect, bijoux charm.  Upon arrival at Vietnam House, we were greeted by the genuine, ebullient welcome of the owner, Jodie. The interior is small, but bright and perfectly formed, with a window booth for seating larger parties and five other tables which seat up to four people, albeit somewhat snugly. As we pored over the menu, struggling to decide which tempting treats to indulge in, Jodie kindly invited us to put our wine in the fridge beside us to stop it getting warm. It was almost like being in a good friend's house and told to make yourself at home!\n\nEventually we decided on fresh spring rolls, followed by Pho Chay (tofu noodle soup) and Com Ca Kho (braised fish with steamed rice). Our lollipop-style starter arrived perched on skewers, a quirky twist which was in juxtaposition to the quirkless simplicity of the dish itself. The overwhelming freshness of the ingredients sang through, soft rice pancakes wrapped around rice noodles, the pork and shrimp harmonising perfectly with the Vietnamese special peanut sauce - my only criticism being that there was not enough of the sauce, leaving the overall dish lacking punch ever so slightly.\n\nOur light starter was followed without too much delay by our fragrant mains. My companion had been advised that the large soup was quite substantial - no exaggeration by anyone's standards! A sizeable bowl arrived, accompanied by coriander, bean sprouts and other accompaniments, to be added to the hearty soup, according to taste. After some experimentation, it was decided that the (once again) outstandingly fresh tasting soup, which spoke simply yet eloquently of the balanced blend of ingredients used, was best enjoyed with a smattering of sprouts and a clutch of coriander on top.\n\nThe braised fish dish arrived in a bowl, accompanied by a smaller bowl of fluffy steamed rice. The large chunk of white fish swam in the snug comfort of the rich red sauce, inviting, fragrant and full of eastern promise. My initial confusion as to how to manage the fluid dish (do I put the rice in the bowl with the fish, if so, how do I eat it with chop sticks?!) gave way to sheer joy at the lightly spiced, full flavour of the dish. The fish was delicate and perfectly cooked, lightly flavoured by the cooking process and excellently accompanied by the sauce. The sole criticism of the simply served dish, is that the unpretentious presentation of the fish on the bone, inevitably involved bones... If you're here on a first date, don't have this dish - picking bones out of your mouth isn't a good look!\n\nDue to pre-wedding diet and time constraints, we decided to forego desserts, so this commentator cannot guide as to the quality of the finish. Next time, I will complete the task! Our bill arrived and I can honestly say that I have rarely been so pleasantly surprised by the inverse proportion of price to quality. The bill for two came in at about \u00a324 including corkage - phenomenal, given that the meal was tasty, fresh, excellently executed and served with the homeliest, warmest and most genuine service I have experienced in Edinburgh for years.  In summary, I repeat - this secret will not be kept for long, so get yourself down to the Vietnam House now, before word gets out."
1,"We were there with a group of 14 for a company dinner. After calling MANY places in Vegas which required a credit card to hold a reservation for a large party, Sushi Samba came through. Friendly staff, no card needed and seriously no hassles at all. they had at least three servers who looked like they were catering to our table alone, especially one lady who was like our private waitress. Lots of Sake, great sushi, appetizers, stew dishes ect, So much was ordered for the table and I didnt do the ordering, so im sorry I cant remember each individual thing but MAN WAS ALL OF IT GOOD!. \n\nOne star is for the rest of the restaurant as it has no atmosphere really. \n\nI would definately go here with a group. Good food and it didnt make me sick as one review says. \n\nWe were pleased with out choice."
0,"Kids playplace smells awful and there is food everywhere.  Will never go there except the drive thru.  Drive thru staff is very pleasant and polite, but it doesn't make up for the messy playplace."
1,Service is great and the atmosphere is cool.\nMy gf and I are fans of TGI Friday and have been to multiple ones in Vegas. I just hate to say but the food at this one was not nearly as good as the other ones. We were disappointed because at places like this you look for consistency but this one wasn't prepared as well as when we went to the others. The service and everything were great which is why I gave it a 4 star but I will definitely just go to the other ones.
0,Wow... This place is terrible!!! I don't usually complain but I feel like I need to let people know. We had a party of 6 people and one hour after ordering we still didn't have our food! The waitress was great but she couldn't tell us what the problem was... We tried to talk to the manager and he got mad and walked away... We left without eating! We did give the waitress $40 because it wasn't her fault. I will tell everyone about my bad experience... The manager was a poor excuse for a manager!!!
1,"Loved my dogs groom here. They did such a good job on her and put an adorable bandana on her after. Groom was excellent and this will be where I take her in the future for that. \n\nI have done a couple daycares and my dog seems to enjoy it. I don't love that the outside area is rock and that is my biggest complaint about the place but I still like it here. I like that they are in small groups indoors but I wish they had a little more space indoors. I almost feel like they are crated, even tho they have someone to play with. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and I really like the owner. I think overall this is a great place to take your dog, clean, friendly, and safe which is most important. There are some areas that I think could improve, but overall I'm very happy with this place so far. I've struggled finding good dog daycares."
1,"I decided to check this place out simply because it was close to my hotel and looked nice from the outside. I ordered Linguine w/White Clam Sauce and was very content. Even the garlic bread was delicious.\n\nThe service: not so great. I was seated outside and had to wait a very long time just for my server to take my order. After I received my food, she was still inattentive."
1,Love this place. My husband won a gift card here so we checked it out. We found so many great pieces of furniture that we ended up spending a bit of our own money also. The salespeople were awesome and very helpful. The delivery people were on time and put everything together just right. We used Mega Furniture before this and it was such a disaster at that place. I am so glad my husband won the gift card or else we may never have tried Living Spaces out. We are actually going back there this weekend to buy a nightstand. Check this place out.
1,Best tasting noodles we have ever had. Love this place so much we eat there a second night! Service is very good. Best Asian restaurant in Las Vegas.
1,"This little place is definitely worth a visit.  Primarily a Greek menu but a little bit of everything.  I think you will find something to your liking.  It's been a while since we have been here but wifey and I went several times for lunch and enjoyed it very much.\n\nNot a lot of seating but clean and nice, comfortable decor.  Hot hostess.\n\nI've also done take-out a few times and it has always been good.\n\nOnly reason it doesn't get five stars is they seem to always be short on wait staff and it can take too long to get out of there if you are working to a lunch deadline."
0,"Didn't see any roses in the \""rose garden\"" and I counted only 5 butterflies in the \""butterfly house\"" -- even the feeding trays were completely empty.  Definitely not 1-star, but also not quite up to \""ok\"" -- 2 stars."
1,"I cannot explain the pastry here.  The guava pastry is insane.   That with a side of black beans, and varied plantains, I'm in love.  I'm a vegetarian, so there were not many options for me.  I would have loves a veggie type version of the empenadas , but the food was great anyway!  I plan on returning in the morning to see the full selections."
0,I hate that I have to come here for my packages now. This is the slowest post office aside from downtown.
1,"Tracy is amazing! She took me from almost black, to almost platinum blonde in 2 visits without damaging my hair! I've been to her multiple times now and she always listens to what I want and actually does it, unlike some stylists who just do what they want. Best bob cut I've ever had"
0,"This place is a great bakery and has very good sandwiches, both for breakfast and lunch.\n\nHowever, it pales in comparison to what it used to be. Their standard of quality has fallen over the last couple years. Now I have to wonder if my sandwich will be burnt or the bread falling apart.\n\nLast week I got a breakfast sandwich that the bread was in many pieces when I unwrapped it. The burnt bacon only making the situation worse.\n\nOver the last 2 years, the prices have risen about 50%. That alone wouldn't dissuade me, but the lower quality is very disappointing.\n\nI used to go weekly, then tapered to monthly, the quarterly. Now I'm not sure if I really want to take the chance on it.\n\nI'm saddened to see such a great place slowly pull itself apart."
1,"Redbeard's has long been a place which I frequent. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2007 I've been coming here (not sure why so many out of town people think its new, its far from new). They have a pretty good selection of beer. I wouldn't say they are a craft beer emporium or anything like that, but at least they value brews other than Coors Light and Bud Light.\n\nTheir menu has a pretty good variety of items on it. They do some more restaurant/dinner type entrees throughout the week as well. I would not say their wings are the best in da 'Burgh, but they are pretty good.\n\nThey recently revamped their menu and increased their prices(having worked in the restaurant industry for many years I understand the need to do this), but it seems they took off some our favorite items. For that I have to give it 4 stars.\n\nThey have a great outdoor seating area which is open almost year round. Others have complained about the loud music. I would agree. The music can be loud, but its  a bar folks!! If you want to watch the Pens, Steelers or Pirates play, you certainly can. Sit in the bar area and the volume is usually pretty loud.\n\nThey have a nice dining room for a bar too. You can request to sit in the far back room if its a more quite atmosphere in which you seek.\n\nI recommend the chicken quesodilla or a burger. Just watch out, its build your own burger and they charge for each topping, but please, don't bark about the price. We all know you can make a burger at home for a buck or two(its one of the best money makers for a restaurant)."
0,"Well, food was bad. My shrimp was TASTELESS....I mean....no seasoning AT ALL. Bland rice. Others at the table said the same thing about their food. Amazing waiter though. For a crazy Friday night with kids everywhere...he was amazing and attentive. Wish I remembered his name. Very tall guy. LOL. This place is geared more for children for sure. A big slide, a balloon guy comes to the tables ect. An adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome. But I would say this place is more for kids than an adult night. That's just my opinion."
1,"There is no comparison. The first time I was here, I spent 2 whole days, opening to closing time trying to get through the store. I kid you not. Now, I'm better - I only take a day, 4-5 hours if I'm in a rush. \n\nThey have sooo much clothes - it's the forever 21 heaven here. It's clean, spacious, and there are tons to choose from. Bright side : there's two floors! It's department store sized.\n\nThey have almost everything you see online, instead of only a limited selection. There's a maternity section and a kids' section here, as well. Their accessories place is kind of limited, but oh well. \n\nThere are plenty of workers here who are pleasant, and ask if you're doing okay. Cashiers are, so far, the most harried and impatient/surly people everr.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this place is their lack of fitting rooms. I think they have only 2 or 3 ever open, even though there are tons scattered throughout the store . This makes for longer lines, antsy people, and more of a hassle to get clothes back to racks. There are so many employees around, why not just open more fitting rooms to make it easier for them ( and us! ) ? \n\nBut anyway, I really love this forever 21. I always go to the fitting room several times (with a full bag every time) and, well, usually leave with a full shopping bag, too. Great selection, great shopping. Done."
0,"Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!"
1,"Our first time dining at  a Bobby Flay restaurant and I must say the food was quite delicious. For starters we had the blue corn pancake with barbecue duck and the tiger shrimp with a garlic corn tamale. The tiger shrimp and the tamale was very delicious, so many different flavors in on little tamale. I found the pancake and duck however to be quite sweet, not one of my favorites. For our main course my wife and i shared the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash, which was splendid as well. Definitely one of the tastier restaurants I've been to in vegas."
0,"I just ate at this restaurant like 2 min ago and let me say I was not impressed. I thought wow there is a legit pasta place by my house  with 4.5 stars let me check it out...WRONG. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. It was ok, nothing to brag about. The worst part was the stale noodles with Elementary School tomato sauce on them. For $12, I expected a little effort. Please avoid this place. Place is super garbanzo. \n\n\nTry Nora's or Rock N Noodles. \nYou will be way more satisfied with those LEGIT choices."
1,"Burgers, Tacos, Wings, & Beer.. everything you'd expect from a diners, drive-ins, & dives professional!\n\nThe Quad is really starting to shape into an attractive Vegas casino.. as long as you don't see their hotel rooms. haha\nThe addition of Guy Fieri's restaurant, along with Hash House, really steps up the food game in this area of the strip..\n\nFood: Going through the menu, there weren't a lot of fancy-shmancy ingredients or toppings.. just your classic all-American foods assembled into fantastic combinations.\nI decided to go with the Mac+Cheese Bacon Burger.. the ultimate burger throw-up! The patty: very thin but wide, coming out of the burger covering the entire bottom bun.. while the bacon and mac&cheese slightly oozed out on top of the patty. This is the true definition of a \""beautiful mess\"". Very tasty burger, loved the 5-cheese mac&cheese and the simple \""backyard BBQ\"" grilled type of burger. \nThe fries that came with the burger came in 3 types: ridged, curly, and wedges.. awesome!\nWe also ordered the Triple-T fries which was like truffle overload with gouda. We didn't get to try any of the specialty cocktails.. there were many interesting concoctions that we'll definitely try next time.\n\nAmbiance: I'd describe it as an Ed Hardy-themed restaurant.. even the napkins had skulls. haha. A lively restaurant with high, exciting energy. If you're there for lunch, definitely sit outside.. you get the view of the walkway between Harrah's and The Quad, and the front of Caesars. I'm not sure how it is at night but probably crazy loud with Harrahs' Carnival court right next door.\n\nService: Staff was great.. there were two consistent servers continually checking on us. It was a bit of a wait for our food to come out but I give them a little leeway since the restaurant's still brand new.\n\nTips: Don't pass up this place if you're torn on what to eat on the strip. Grab a burger, a few drinks, and enjoy!"
1,"I admit it. When I was little and used to visit my favorite candy store, I would tell my parents that I couldn't wait 'till I grew up because then I could to eat all the candy in the world. But, then I did grow up and realized the consequences of actually eating all the candy in the world. So now it's normally just a piece or two here or there...maybe more than two on occasion. But, thank you Smeeks for making me that kid in the candy store again. The first time I walked in, I looked like a deer in headlights trying to take in the adorable setting and endless shelves of any type of candy you can imagine. \n\nCharlie, you might ditch the chocolate factory after a visit to Smeeks. Picture your dream candy store as a kid...not huge but ginormous to you (since you are a kid after all). Then walk into Smeeks. There's a good chance, they'll be one in the same. \n\nI spent a good amount of time browsing through the candy selection and mentally gobbling every piece. You have the option to fill a cute little handle-clad box with candy of choice like Carmel, chocolate, taffy, etc etc etc. They have everything from classics like ever-lasting gobstoppers, to unique treats you couldn't find anywhere else. And don't forget about the fun knick knacks you haven't seen since childhood. If you know a child or an adult who still acts like one, you can find a great gift here. \n\nWhen I saw the cute setup and perfectly arranged sweets, I thought Smeeks would be overly priced. It was just too cute to be true, right? But I was happily surprised when I realized it wasn't. You can satisfy your sweet tooth without burning a hole in your wallet. I left with a couple of treats for myself and a lot more for my three year old nephew. I wish they threw birthday parties (maybe they do?) because Smeeks is a ready-made birthday party waiting for the guests."
0,"OMG, this Holt is horrible ! When you're used to the Bay-Bloor one in Toronto, this one looks like a grocery store !!\nThe selection is pretty small and actually not really good either... Example; my boryfriend went there to buy a pair of Tod's shoes, they only carried 3 pairs... 3 pairs !!!! Nothing !!! \nWe waited 15 min to have a snoby, rude saleswomen finally serving us... Of course, we didn't buy anything and will not spend any penny in that Holt Renfrew, better wait and go to Toronto or in France...."
1,This place is amazing. Nice little gem in Tempe. A nice variety of hummus my favorite being the chipotle hummus. The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly and very good service. Enjoy!!!!
1,"Great tacos!  I wasn't expecting it to be so nice.  I also thought that the fajitas were really tasty!  Something about that sizzle.  The manager was super knowledgable too, and suggested a mango margarita for my wife which she thought had the perfect balance of taste and tequila. Pro ballers that live in the area have also been known to drop by on occasion too, so good people watching at night.  If you haven't tried it yet, it's worth the trip."
0,"Very pricey...at least compared to normal yogurt places such as Yogurtland. The yogurt itself is very creamy...together. It's actually a bit too creamy for me as I wanted a more yogurt-y feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip. Anyway, this is what I tried:\n\nCheesecake: Definitely reminds me of a sour cream/cream cheese mix, but VERY, very creamy.\n\nTart: I honestly thought you couldn't go too wrong with plain tart, but it was creamy and way too sour. There was really no flavor to it; just creamy sourness...if that's even a flavor.\n\nChocolate: Again, a bit of a disappointment. It did taste better than most of the other yogurts, but it wasn't too satisfying. I guess it's one of those \""I'll eat it if I have to since I'm craving CHOCOLATE AND I NEED IT NOW!!!\"" last resorts.\n\nPistachio: Absolutely no flavor. Just a sweet icy thing. Hideous.\n\nStrawberry: This one was my favorite. It was pretty much the only edible thing there...actually tasted like strawberries and cream. Again, not the best by far, but certainly edible.\n\nOverall, I am definitely still on my search to find a decent yogurt place in Vegas..."
1,"Dragged my butt in early on a Saturday because the dreaded tire pressure light came on. Asked them to check it out. Of course I had a giant screw in one of the tires. They patched it at no charge and got me in and out in 45 minutes. \n\nOnly complaint I have is that they did the patch without first telling me what the issue was. I would have preferred to buy a new tire instead. I know they were just trying to save me money, but I should have been in the loop. \n\nI have been here before and they seem to do a decent job. Customer service is not perfect but they have always been honest with me. And any woman who has been to auto places by herself knows this is not always the case. While my experience today was not perfect, I believe they were trying to do their best. \n\nI only recommend in the future they keep the customer informed before starting to do the work."
1,So instead of going to Gibson Automotive to get my wifes battery swapped out we had $20.00 off $100.00 purchase coupon for Pep Boys on South BLVD. Made an appointment for noon. At 12:05 Liz called and they said that we needed a new alternator and not only that the $20.00 coupon only works for in store purchases (it says car batteries right on it). I told her to pay for the battery and meet me at Gibson....5 minutes later Larry Gibson comes out with the tests from 2 different machines saying nothing is wrong with the alternator. No charge and hope to see you soon......Pep Boys wanted over $460.00.....free installation? Scam Artists (Pep Boys) is more like it. \n\nI have been taking my cars to Gibson since they were at their old location on South. I do not trust any other mechanics in town....thanks to Pep Boys for reminding me of that.
1,"I went thru the drive thru. The voice on the speaker was a male, he had a very clear, understandable voice. He made sure my order was correct on the board (screen) before I pulled off. Came to the window to pay and saw Christopher, who took my order. He was very polite, asked if I needed hot sauce, I asked for \""mild\"", he asked, medium mild or medium hot, I said medium hot. Like finally someone cares about \""my needs\"" at a fast food drive thru...I'm happy!!! Thank you Christopher for a great experience at a fast food place, I had no complaints."
1,"This was the best of the 4 buffets we tried with our Buffet of Buffets pass.  The quality was good and choices were plenty.  We had dinner there, and wished we tried their breakfast.  Would definitely come back the next time we are in Vegas."
1,This was my favorite place when I lived in Vegas. Good beef dishes. A consistent kitchen preparing time-honored recipes. Sabado Gigante on the TV renders it somehow m\u00e1s aut\u00e9ntico.
1,"Five stars if my second visit is as good as the first.  I had a few minutes to kill in the afternoon, so just went in to have a look around because I've heard good things.  Even though there wasn't much left in the pastry counter, what was there was amazing.  AMAZING!  The pastries were all so beautiful they almost didn't look real.  Some of the chocolate even was finished with this metallic substance that made them look just like copper.  The girl behind the counter was so nice and patiently answered all the stupid questions falling from my drool covered face.  So of course I had to try a mousse, and may I say AMAZING!  Best mousse I've had in years.  There were obviously no shortcuts in ingredients or preparation.  Can't wait to go back and try more!"
0,"Charged us $15 for a small fast food. Food wasn't good and based on the place and the quality, plates should be $6 not $15. That's what you would expect to pay for a really nice food and a nice restaurant in Phoenix."
0,"My dining experience at T.G.I. Friday's started out exceptional. There was absolutely no wait (which I found odd for a Saturday night). The staff sat us in a booth (which was preferable due to us having four children). And our server was amazing and attentive.\n\nAs excellent as everything was up to this point it saddens me to say that the food itself was...off. My cheeseburger was under-cooked. My son couldn't finish his kid's cheeseburger saying \""every time I take a bite I feel like I'm going to throw up.\"" And my wife said something with her Parmesan crusted flounder tasted weird. She said she couldn't determine if it was the fish itself or the breading but considering how sick it's made her already I'm assuming it was the fish itself.\n\nThe rating I'm giving this experience is driven primarily on the quality of the food. When the food itself has your family feeling sick afterward it isn't a good thing. I may come back someday, but it probably won't be anytime in the near future."
0,"Loved this Joint... Love No More... !\nThey have changer everything, the only Buffet they have available now is the Hot-Dog Buffet, with only ONE choice of Dog... they used to have at least 8 choices of Weiner's, Brats, Smoked Sausages, Dog's from New York, Chicago...etc... it ROCKED..!!!  they still have Sandwiches a-la-carte... No more Prime Rib or Crab Legs... \nthey used to have a soft-serve Ice Cream that was part of the Buffet's, no more, now thy have a glassed in Ice Cream freezer with scoops you can purchase... \n\nHey it's not bad but it's NOT G's anymore..!!! call it something else...\n \nI'm not going back ...they didn't honour my \""Yelp Deal\""  that I bought for $10 that buys you a coupon for $20 worth of food from G's... I believe that legally they have to take the \""Yelp Deals\""...\nwe paid the bill with cash and said Adi\u00f3s to the Cook... \n\nI don't expect them to survive for very long unless they go back to the G's we all know and Love... \n\nIf it Ain't broke don't break-it... :("

1,"I'm a regular there because my office is in the Hancock, so it's very convenient and I find a lot of products from Italy that are difficult to find elsewhere. Tostini are very good, pizza is just ok and it's not too expensive. My fav thing is the caprese salad, I can't say it's delicious because mozzarella is from canada and it tastes like nothing, but it's decent and relatively inexpensive"

1,"Now you know a taco place is good when you don't have to always settle for carne asada. Gordos has the best spicy pork tacos! And they're proud of it :) this has been the best taco I've had for a whole-in-the-wall place. The vibe is great too, from workers to customers. The place is crackin up until 4am. Oh and best of all.. Non stop refills on horchata"
1,Played here last week- was fun! Staff is super friendly and the proceeds went to a homeless shelter and soup kitchens. My hubby had never played bingo before but he enjoyed himself and wants to go back before we end our vacation
1,"The vibe is super cool. Although trendy and somewhat posh, there's a cozy feel about the restaurant. I've enjoyed patio dining on a few occasions now and it's super cute. The patio is along the canal which gives a relaxed feel to things. Although a bit pricey, you are paying for the location and experience and I'd say it was definitely worth it."
1,"Been here more than once after a night out of drinking.. But now I can say I've been here sober and not so sober!\n\nQuick seating, although it gets busy! Friendly staff & good for kids when the sun is still up. \n\nLike everyone says-- it IS like a Cheesecake Factory minus the cheesecake, but in my opinion and if I'm willing to make the drive out here, I like it better! \n\nThis time around the better half and I had :\nBlue Cheese Salad - not a blue cheese fan but this was good, could have a little less dressing\nCalamari - FAVORITE! I liked the added fried zucchini and onions! \nKobe Meatballs - big meatballs, juicy and tender meatballs! Not too much sauce, comes on a bed of creamy polenta.\n\nI unfortunately could not have any of the pasta dish but it did look good! \n\nMust try if you're in the strip area!"
1,"Went here for my daughters bachelorette party.  Crowd was very small, but Marc worked it none the less.  I have been to hypnotists before, and they are really not my thing.  But, I thought it would be fun for the girls.  We had a few get on stage, and then the bachelorette went under in the audience.  I was pissing myself!  His comedy was adult, but not raunchy.  I was very pleased with the experience.  The draw back-the video they sell was awful.  One of our girls was in the last chair onstage and was never in the shot, which is just a still of the stage the whole time.  Pretty generic, but captured it I suppose.  For the price it's good fun.  Go with a brave group and let loose."
0,"eh.. this isnt such a bad hotel, but it can use some improvements. there hall way stinks like smoke and wet carpet. i dont know why they have smoking and non smoker room after every other room. its so retarded... but oh well.. you get what you pay for.. the up side is FREE BREAKFAST!"
1,"Located in the Venetian by the living statue, Cocolini's serves up some yummy sorbets and gelatos. You can grab a scoop and then sit at one of the surrounding benches and enjoy while people watching. We got the Old Fashion Lemon Zest which tasted like a Lemon Chill you could get at a state fair. Love the bits of the lemon in it as it gave little intense pops of additional flavor to the already lemony sorbet. Very refreshing on a hot Vegas day."
0,"Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same reason as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.\n\nWhy do I hate it so...? \n\nPretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day. \n\nPeople walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free."
0,My buddy and I have been there a few times. It's a good location. That's about it. The happy hour food is subpar. Drink prices are alright. It's usually pretty open so that's why we go there. Then again with the poor food and lackluster service that could be why.
0,"Let me preface this Yelp Review with this point: I can appreciate the low prices that Wal-Mart provides, but I generally think Wal-Mart as a corporation is the scum of the Earth.  This Wal-mart specifically is super ghetto, people take their small children shopping at 11:00 at night, and the employees are extremely unprofessional.  Case in point: my girlfriend stopped at this Wal-mart the other night to get a few things because this location is very close to my house.  Upon entering the store we realized that we would need a cart.  I circled back to where the carts are usually kept to grab one but there were none to be found.  I noticed that Wal_mart had two \""greeters\"" at the door not doing anything.  I asked one of the greeters if they had any carts available, and she responded that all the carts were in the parking lot and if I wanted one I should go out in the parking lot and get one. I said \""Seriously? You don't have any carts for your customers?\""  She reiterated that I would have to go out to the parking lot and find a cart.   I always assumed that the greeters role (besides putting those little stickers on returns) was to provide customers with a cart.   \n\nWal-mart - since when is it the customer's job to collect carts for you?  You are the wealthiest corporation in the world, I'm sure you can pay someone minimum wage to collect your carts.  If you want customers to shop and return, maybe you will learn the concept of customer service."
0,"Haircut was just OK, after telling the barber that I wanted a size \""3\"" clipper and somewhat textured hair on top I ended up with a very short cut, probably more like a \""2\"" (did he use the wrong clipper guard size?) and very super military short on top, no texture at all. It will take 8 weeks to get my hair back to a normal length again. The cut is clean but way too crew cut short, I won't go back again. The barber kept stopping in the middle of my haircut to watch television too, not cool. And so much unswept hair all over the floor. I'm sure there are better barbers who listen to what the customer asks for and who pay attention."
1,"Went to Envy for the Sunday Brunch.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The selection was smaller due to it being in the steakhouse, but the quality was very good.  The price includes unlimited champagne, mimosas and for Bloody Mary fans, they have a nice make your own Bloody Mary bar.  It was very busy but the service was still good.  Much nicer on the inside than the outside looks."
0,"Went to Ling & Louie's with a friend for dinner tonight to discuss upcoming photoshoots and design work. \nWe walked in and were greeted by the bartender, and then we waited to be seated for what seemed like forever. \nFinally the bartender ended up seating us and was very friendly, however, once again we waited, and waited, for a server to greet us.\nI have been in the service industry for well over 10yrs and this kind of treatment of customers is just completely inexcusable.\n I was glad I was in good company because otherwise I may have walked out.\nOnce we were greeted by a server, she didn't seem very personable or attentive to out needs or making sure that we were satisfied. She didn't really even seem to care that we were there or not.\nWe ordered appetizers and dinner. I was very pleased with the calamari that came with semi spicy sauce.\nI ordered the ahi tacos which were also amazing! \nI was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to try any dessert.\nIf It wasn't for the awesome food I would have only given one star. \nNot sure I would return unless it were just to hang out at the bar and only to be served by the sweet bartender."
0,"Eh! This place looks promising after looking at reviews and the menu, but don't be fooled it's not great!  \n\nWe started by ordering the fries sampler with zucchini, Mac n cheese and pepper jack shots (just fried cheese). This was delicious!' Then we ordered burgers and shakes and beer. The burgers didn't come out as ordered and at the end we were charged for everything we ordered that wasn't on the burger. The burgers took a while. The shake and beer we ordered with our appetizers didn't come out until halfway through the burgers! We also had to remind her twice about them!!  \n\nThe burgers weren't very good. The pepper bacon was sweet... Shouldn't be! The burger meat was mealy. I would only go back for the shake (Nutella with Godiva chocolate liqueur) and the pepper jack cheese shots. Don't go in with high expectations!"
1,Typical chinese food. Nothing special. Better service than most.
0,"I'm really disappointed I had high expectations because of the good reviews on here. First, I had call wanted to place a delivery order, but they inform me that they do not deliver so I decided to pick it up.  The fried ravioli were ok, it has a thin cheese filling. The garlic knots have a good flavor but the texture however was kinda spongy.\nNow let's talk about the pizza, it is so bland! I can't even taste the sauce nor the cheese. It kinda reminds me of the pizza from my middle school cafeteria,which it also taste a slightly better than this place. \nI would not return. sorry !"
1,The tuna pizza with the truffle oil was really good! I also liked the eggplant skewers and the roll with the POPROCKs! \n\nWe sat near the patio and had a view of the watershow so that was kinda cool. Generally a good experience - the service was kinda weird (brought out our sake cups then 10 mins later brought out the sake) but we were just enjoying ourselves and having a good time in Vegas so it didn't matter to us. PLUS the head chef came out to chat with us for a bit and took pics with us. Would go back - def better than that sushi place that used to be at Treasure Island.
0,"Stopped in here for a 2-Piece Meal for lunch today & specified FOR HERE when the cashier gal asked me.  Soon, a guy appeared from the back with my meal packaged TO GO.  I nicely reminded him that it was for here, & he shoved a tray at me with a big serving of attitude!     :-O\n\nWent to wash my hands & there were no paper towels in the bathroom, & not even one of those air blowers!     :-O\n\nCHURCH'S CAN DO A LOT BETTER THAN THIS!!     :-(("
0,Just got back from staying at The D. While I love what the new owner has done with the place. Whoever he hired to set up and staff the D grill really dropped the ball. Took twenty minutes to get seated in what we found out was a half empty restaurant. We were told that we had to wait so that our server could prepare for us. Well.... He should have prepared better. Long story short. 6 people walked out.
1,"OMG...How can I properly Describe this popcorn???  Freaking AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I am not even big on popcorn..but when I tried some of their caramel cashew popcorn..that was the best things I've ever tasted in my LIFE..I live in San Diego and had a craving for this popcorn after buying some for the first time... and went back up there and bought some a few weeks later!! It is just that good..Guaranteed, no corn on Earth can touch this one!! I even liked their plain buttered popcorn...Just some good quality stuff...You can taste all of the rich butter in each bite..and the caramel flavoring is indescribable..Definitely DO come here and buy their popcorn!!!"
1,"I skipped the gym so I can eat some deep-fried chicken and since I was in the area, I decided to give Strip N Dip a try. I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. \""This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural\""...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?\n\nI was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.\n\nChicken:\nYou choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5\n\nSide Dishes:\nThey have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5\n\nSauces:\nYour options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5"
1,"i agree with the other reviewers, this is a great place to hookup with friends or just hang out.  Nancy & Bryan make Wifi available so you could work from there while you quaffed your fav wines, which they have a bunch of.\n\nThe Happy Hour prices are insane for the product they serve.  No corkage charge either if you bought the bottle there and want to drink it now.\n\nI'll be going back AND taking friends!"
0,"I was disappointed in the show because about 15 minutes into the show, I realized I was not watching the original members. And what tipped me off was the 6'-2\"" tall, 220 lb dude in a mask. If you are a die hard fan, you can tell by the movements that they weren't the members you saw on television. The show I watched was pretty much watching the equivalent of a cover band playing your favorite band's music. It was still good, it just wasn't what I thought I was paying for. I did complain to Monte Carlo to try to get my money back and this was their response:\n\n\""All performers are indeed Jabbawockeez, in every performance. They have expanded their crew and on any given performance, they rotate.\""\n\nI know some of the dancers are Super Crew members during the b-boy numbers, but you can tell that the routines for the original members were filled in by other dancers. They did do a decent job though, but I still would not buy another ticket to see them perform. I would pay to watch them again if I knew for sure it was going to be the original members. My 2 star rating would be bumped up to 4 stars if that was the case.\n\nOther than that, the show is about 2 hours long and more than half of that is filled with comedic mime skits and audience participation numbers. Totally understandable because it would be hard to fill two solid hours of dancing routines. The dance routines were well done. If you have seen all their you-tube videos, you have seen all their dance numbers in the show.\n\n2 Stars... JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!!"
0,"Just got back from Vegas in which we stayed the last night at Aria, so thought we would hit their breakfast buffet, thinking it would be on par with Belligo and Wynn. Boy, were we wrong. OK, know it's only their second day in operation, but how can you screw up bacon and eggs? My wife and I were shown our table, and immediately went to get our food. The food area was quite long, but not a great selection. Usually I walk and look at the food and figure out the few things that look best so I can fit them onto my plate, but here, it was a struggle to find enough things appealing enough to eat. Their eggs benedict looked very weird; the eggs were freakishly white. Hard to find just regular breakfast fare. There were two omelet stations with many people waiting at each ( you know a buffet is bad when people opt for the 'ol standby omelet) I got in line behind Mr. Picky who had to have a special egg white only omelet with veeeery light Cheddar cheese and was also behind some punk kid who was eating off his plate in line. Idiot. The chef manning the station seemed overwhelmed by the special order so I moved on. A huge slice of ham (not bad), some Chinese egg concoction and a slice of pizza later I went back to eat. Started eating and no server yet. Half way through and still no server. Finally when I was almost done, a server asked if I wanted anything to drink. I barely chocked out, \""orange juice\"". Finally, when I was on my second to last bite, my drink came, all six ounces of it. I asked for two more. \nFor 15 bucks, this should have been much better. I have gotten just a good breakfast at Terribles for half the price. Also, since this place should be one of the elite, what I found totally tacky was at each of the foods, instead of having a nice plaque with what the food is, it was written on the sneeze windows with grease pencil. Totally lame. Not sure if we would go back to eat here even if comped. Perhaps their lunch and dinners are better."
1,Josh in the movie theaters was awesome and had excellent customer service!! Well definitely go back
1,"The name makes my mouth water.  Matts Big Breakfast.  \nQuality food, this location will make you proud of what downtown phoenix has to offer and what is to Come.  From the vegetables to the meat selection hand picked food creates quality dishes.  \n  This location serves a  big breakfast in a small place. I look forward to seeing this place grow, do i hear patio?"
0,Everything has gone downhill at this location. Most recently we ordered a kids cheese crisp which was clearly microwaved. The worst part was watching the bus boy sweeping the floor and then the seats of the booths. I don't even want to checkin for my last visit.
1,"Went on a Sunday. There weren't any tables, but plenty of room at the bar. My dining companion and I both got the AYCE, which I think is a steller price for the quality of food here. My dining companion knew one of the chefs and asked for an \""omakase\"" -- whatever was good as picked by the chef. I'm not sure exactly all what we had, but wow it was good! They also have \""side dishes\"" -- things like grilled pork belly and this really delicious rice cracker thing. This is definitly a place I would like to go to again."
1,"who's ready to parrrtayyy! my girls and I had sooooo much fun! i wish we could have stayed longer, but our feet just would not allow. Different rooms with different music. If you just want to dance your heart out stop on by.. try and pre-game because drinks are an arm and a leg. Thank god we made friends with a promoter, who 1. got us in free and skipped the line, and 2. gave us each a drink voucher, or else we would have had to pay 26 bones for a shot of patron! *gasps*...i know! terrifying!. but all in all a must stop when in town!"
1,Real nice local place in Matthews. The outdoor seating is really nice for people watching and the food was above average. The menu was somewhat normal for I did not see much that really jumped out at me but the service was good and the quality of the food was above average.\n\nWe will be back for lunch or maybe dinner.
0,Have eaten here for years and always loved the food. Figured I'd stop by and grab a falafel sandwich and it was nothing like it used to be. Very sad the new owners don't have a clue. Also now way over priced. I played $13 for this with no fries used to be like $8-9 with fries and got it to go. No napkins no bag and asked twice for some hot sauce which is not the old homemade stuff they used to have that was like crack. No this is Frank's with water added....wtf. Then I asked the waiter why he didn't offer me the lunch special ( falafel plate) that was cheaper and came with hummus ? He responded oh I didn't even notice that sorry. It's alright food sucks now won't be back . I wish I would have taken a picture because compared to the picture on here of the sandwich this thing was repulsive.  Keep in mind alot of these pictures on here are from the old ownership.
1,Introduced two friends to Lucille's recently-and they loved it!  Always a plus when you get to start with fresh hot bisucits smothered in cinnamon honey buter.
1,"What an excellent cozy friendly joint, with surprisingly delicious and affordable food! I was hugely happy with the battered cod tacos I scarfed down last night, which I only ordered because when do you see cod tacos on a pub menu? Served on a sturdy wooden cutting board were two baskets of two-hand sized tacos stuffed to the brim with plump, lovely lightly battered cod, and delicious guacamole and salsa. Also on the board were an unexpected basket of rosemary fries, and a bowl of salad - just nice fresh mixed greens and tomatoes. This fed myself and a friend and the fries were shared around the table and the whole meal cost about $12. (Round of applause for all things affordable and tasty and unexpected!!) \n\nWhile we ate and drank our pints the placed filled up nicely and the back section became a fiddle jam. Service was friendly and lowkey and the room itself is aged wood and leather, comfy but not cluttered with pub gimmickery. Tasteful and cozy cool all around, I'll be back for sure."
0,"It's a vey busy place on a cold November night. I was really not impressed. Yes, the thin pizza crust from the wood oven is good, but the ingredients are out of balance: too much arugula on mine, too little mozzarella. Same lack of balance for my 3 friends, It is really average pizza by all means. If you like a busy restaurant, the settings are OK and the service decent, but for the food and price, you can easily get better."
0,I've heard of supply demand but this place truly capitalized on other rental car companies in airport being unavailable.  $600 for 4 day rental of a ridiculous Mustang!  I took for the day then reserved a vehicle with Avis the next day.\n\nEnterprise also doesn't have a preferred program worthwhile...\n\nI'll stay with Avis and now I know why Time Warner doesn't use them as a corporate provider.
1,"Definitely one of the best and my favorite Mexican restaurants in the greater phoenix area. I've literally eaten here two nights in a row: the service is always awesome, everyone is so nice. I've tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed, it's all SO GOOD. I'm not a vegetarian but they have amazing vegetarian options that even I get sometimes. Seriously, why go to filibertos or some place like that when you can get restaurant service for practically the same price, AND you get bottomless chips and salsa AND the food is better. Great good, great prices, great people/service, never probably go to another Mexican restaurant in Phoenix."
0,"Received a functioning car, drop-off was smooth.\n\nCheck-in, however, was ridiculous. Despite NO line, and half a dozen bored counter staff, it took a full 30 minutes to process an existing reservation and procure me an actual vehicle. For the first 10 minutes there was no indication of a problem. For the second 10 minutes, as I looked increasingly impatient while watching the staff member apparently program the space shuttle or possibly update his Facebook status for the 17th time, no indication of a problem and no apology for the time-wasting. For the third 10 minutes, there was a grunt about finding me a car of the appropriate reservation class, followed by an additional grunt about \""this would have been a lot easier if you hadn't made your reservation in Hotwire\"". Really? So if Budget accepts Hotwire reservations but has trouble processing them, that's the customer's fault?\n\nAlso - apparently the counter staff communicate with the car moving staff via push-to-talk cell phone. That's fine. Apparently the counter staff also do not know where the charger to said phone is, and spend lots of time yelling at each other about where it is. So, if that cell phone loses charge, does that mean nobody gets a car?  \n\nThis is my second poor Budget experience in a row in two completely different states. Lesson learned."
1,"Over the past year and a half I have been plagued by chronic back pain. My primary doctor gave me a referral to this pain center after I had an MRI done of my lower spine which revealed a bulge at my L5.\nAnyways.. I was a little bummed when I first made my appointment, because this place is pretty far from my home. But I decided to suck it up and go, instead of whining to my doctor for a new referral.\n\nMy first appointment wasn't a great one, after being told to go to a different doctor (due to one leaving this center) and having to change around my appointment several times, I wasn't able to see my doctor (Dr. Lanzkowsky) until and HOUR after my appointment time! I was furious! But I decided to come back for a follow up anyways (partly because I didn't want to go back to my primary doctor again)\n\nMy second appointment was much better. Dr. Lanzkowsky is great doctor. He is always ready to get right down to the root of the problem, which I like. After dealing with so much pain for so long I was relieved to have a doctor like this.\n\nDr. Lanzkowsky decided it was best for me to undergo a set of medial branch block spinal injections at my L3 L4 and L5. I was terrified, having never had any type of \""procedure\"" done before.\nThe day of my procedure I showed up at the office, wearing pajamas and undoubtedly a look of terror. When I was brought into the pre-op area the nurses were incredibly friendly and talked me through what was going to be happening, they helped ease a bit of my anxiety.\nI then met with the anesthesiologist, who told me that they would be putting my completely under for the procedure, which scared me yet again. I had never been put under anesthesia. He again helped ease my fears.\n\nThen I was lead into the room where these injections would take place. Everyone was really nice, and I was out like a light. When I was brought out of the anesthesia I was greeted by smiling nurses. \n\nSince those injections I've returned for another set (I filled out my pain log wrong and got in trouble so I had to get more) and I have a follow up appointment this week to (hopefully) get a concrete answer on what's wrong with this back of mine.\n\nI'm eager to continue treatment with Dr. Lanzkowsy. I would definitely recommend him to anyone seeking a good pain management doctor."
0,"I love Whole Foods, eat there almost every day. This location however does not carry half the products most do, the salad bar is weak and I just bought some cut fruit with mold at the bottom. Go to the Ray Rd location if you have the means it's a much better location."
1,I Love Love Love their Pizza! Friendly Service and I have Pizza from there at least 3 times a month! The online ordering and specials make it easy! Everything was fresh and made to perfection and the price is always right.. I'll be back! :)
1,"We've been to Bacon Bar several times, and the food has always been very good and very consistent. My favorite item is the Bacon Burger; it's literally the BEST burger I've ever had! In fact, I love it so much, I can't seem to order anything else for my entree! Lol My husband had the Bacon Sloppy Joe and said it was very good. Must've been, since he ate the whole thing in about 5 minutes flat and he never eats much. The Man Candy is decadent, as it's served with Crown Royal Maple infused syrup. YUM!! I like that they have a lot of items on the menu other than bacon. I looooove bacon, so I'm in heaven when we eat there, but my daughter likes other things, so there's a good selection for her to choose from.\n\nThe service is good to very good and the servers have always been friendly. We always sit at the bar so we can play the machines. We've never won anything significant so the machines seem to be a little tight, but each time our drinks/beers were comped. We would go to Bacon Bar more, but it's about a 25 minute drive from our house."
0,"WARNING!!! Do not use ANNETTE CARTER for any rental needs. I was renting a property owned by this woman and not only did she took my entire deposit but is also trying to charge me more on top of that. I was a great tenant. I added landscaping to the house and left it in great condition. You see, she purchased this house from my friend who I was renting it from and now she is trying to charge me for everything that was broken since before she purchased the property. She was aware that the previous owner had left the house like this when she purchased it. Now she wants me to pay for everything the house needed fixed when she purchased it. This is a very bad person. DO NOT TRUST HER. This kind of people need to be STOPPED! They take advantage of common renters like you and I."
1,"Every time I go into this place its with good times and cheery mates and I leave the wiser with a pint of fresh brew and some of the best food. \n\nTo make a great date, go to the Phoenix Rock Gym first and then climb the ladder on the back wall and walk in around the back...Great times for every one!"
0,"If you are looking for a great place to eat off the strip this is not it.  The place is overpriced, the server we had spent the entire time telling us how bad it was to work their.  I can almost imagine how bad it must be if the radio commercial focus on his nephew or son being able to fix your computer almost while you eat. I think the true character of the owner is obvious in his public ads.  However, we still went to check it out, and we are still sorry that we wasted out money.  Better places to eat in the same location."
1,"We came here with a group of 50 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner.\n\nFor around $56 a person, we got the All You Can Eat salad/seafood bar, all you can eat meats brought to you (tri tip, sirloin, filet, bacon wrapped turkey, chicken, pork) side dishes (mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, garlic bread, corn on the cob) and dessert.\n\nThe food was amazing and the service was outstanding. The servers come around consistently with different meats on a stick and accouterments and my plate was never empty. Who likes meat on a stick? This girl.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that they garnish everything at the salad bar with green onions. Every single dish, including the lobster bisque, is sprinkled with nasty green onions. Not everyone cares for the taste of raw onions, so maybe just put them on the side for people who want them? Garnishing dishes with green onions is lazy and unimaginative. Just sayin'."
0,"I have two stays at Flamingo, because I am not good at learning my lessons the first time around. My first problem is I used to fall for all those comp offers Harrah's sends at you. Honestly, when you realize flights are on sale and you can get your hotel stay for FREE, who says no? \n\nWell, this guy is now in the business of saying \""no\"" to all Harrah's offers. Free is good, but comfort and time are more important. Harrah's properties steal both. My first complaint with Flamingo is it is tragically dated. Like, it's sad. We recently did a week-long stay where we split it between Flamingo and Paris. My first words once we got to our room in Paris were, \""We're never staying at Flamingo again.\""\n\nEverything about the place is ancient, with no hope in sight. The rooms are comical. Almost as bad as Bally's. So, you would think well at least you could get a room with a view, right? Well, no matter how many hundreds of dollars we (and by \""we\"" I mean my wife) donated to the casino floor, we still were never afforded a strip-front room. And that's crap, because I know it's an option. \n\nTwo stars because I've always found the staff to be very friendly and the buffet is a good option on an off-night with a coupon."
0,"OK.  So this place seems to have undergone some sort of management change.  All of the old staff is gone and with it the service, cleanliness, and food.  We used to come here regularly but after last night I doubt we'll be going back.  We were greeted quickly and sat at a booth.  However, while we were walking to the booth you could clearly see food on the floor under the table.  No attempt was made to clean the floor.  We ordered Fried Rice which came cold.  The Kung Pao Vegetable plate was OK.  My wife ordered some chicken plate which she said was bland with no flavor.  I don't get it.  Why do restaurant owners forget what they are in business for.  All I want is good food and good service.  This restaurant missed the mark on both counts."
1,stop by and say hi to mandy! i've been to the burgh a few times now and she is our favorite part of the north shore! best pub style bar by far in these parts
1,"Dominos has gotten really good in the last few years. \n\nYou're saying, \""Five stars? For Dominos? C'mon.\"" \n\nNo, you come on. Their pizza's good, it's fast, it's affordable, and their customer service is spectacular. Is it Spinato's or NYPD? No, but Spinato's not open late, they're way more expensive, and they don't have an awesome online ordering system.\n\nFor economy pizza delivery, it's basically the Hut vs Dominos vs Papa John's. Out of those three, my favorite is the big D."
1,"Can't believe I never reviewed this--I've been going to Cha Cha since 2004, with a year-long break when I was out of town.  When I got back after my absence, I was very disappointed to discover that Janet was gone, but I couldn't be happier with Gen doing my hair!\n\nI keep my hair in various shades of hot pink, red, and orange, with a fairly funky/spiky style, but Gen also cuts the hair of two other grad students of my acquaintance who are much more conservative in their hair choices, and she makes them look great, too.  She's very good about giving people what THEY want, whatever that might be, but she also always has input of her own to pin down a vague idea I might have into something that looks awesome on my actual head.\n\nSeriously, I think the worst thing about actually graduating and leaving Madison will be having to find someone to replace Gen."
1,"A good friend and I took the time to reconnect and catch up for lunch. Working downtown gives us the luxury to choose from an array of restaurants and eateries. Working downtown for a while means I've had the opportunity to visit a lot of places, however, I've never been to Stewart & Ogden. My friend said this place was awesome and we should try it. Aside from the OK reviews on Yelp, I wanted to check this place out for myself.\n\nWhen I approached this joint, the first thing I thought of was luxury. At first glance, this place looked like a regal diner, with very prominent focal points around. One of the first things you'll notice is the checkered floors, the old century type chandeliers and aesthetically designed ceilings. Booths and table tops accented with sky blue gives the pop of color while also helping to build the luxury look. When it came to the service, it was more casual than the look. Our server's name was Tey. He was accommodating and did start a little bit of conversation with us. What I liked about him was that he did give us our space during our meal. Thumbs up for him.\n\nFor lunch I decided to get the Ogden Burger for $10. I wanted something filling and the name obviously attracted me as well. This burger is cooked to your temperature, topped with grilled tomatoes, bacon, shallot aioli and fried onions. The burger was definitely the star of the show. It was cooked at the medium rare temperature I requested and SUPER flavorful. It was perfect seasoned and really made the burger that much better. I also loved that they included thick cut bacon. The saltiness of the bacon also enhanced the flavor. To me though, the aioli and tomatoes got lost in the mix, didn't even notice the tomatoes until the end. Overall, it was a great burger and packed with deliciousness. For my side, I chose the tater tots and glad I did! Another great hit, super crispy, not too oily and one things for sure: the chefs know how to season their food!\n\nI've been raving about my seasoned burger since I visited this place. That can only mean one thing: I'm definitely coming back again soon! They serve breakfast as well, so that a good excuse enough to return. I'm glad that I didn't follow the overall Yelp rating. I thought is was a little better than just OK.  If you're in the area, come down and check them out!"
1,This location is always clean and the staff is friendly. I visit here when the truck is being serviced next door. The same team always seem to be working the front as well. Pristine both for food and experience!
1,"I am sorry this restaurant is not closer to our part of town, for when we are craving Indian food! My husband and I stopped in for their lunch buffet. A great selection, and all the food tasted fresh. I thought the particular standouts were the Goat Curry, the onion bhaji, and the garlic naan. I love goat, and of course its not easy to find in the U.S., and this is a staple on Delhi's buffet. Goat meat is a little stronger tasting than beef, and stood up to the sauce very well. The cuts of meat are on-the-bone...I wanted to dive in with my fingers and grab each piece and gnaw it clean!  The onion bhaji was crisp and tasty; not greasy at all. And the garlic naan was light and chewy and very, very fresh.\nI'm not a big fan of the bright yellow curry sauces, but my husband reported that the Punjabi curry was very good. The saag paneer was good also.. The tandoori chicken wasn't as highly spiced as I like, but it was moist enough to be tasty. Like the onion bhaji, the samosas were crisp, not soggy, and had a nice flavor. The biryani rice was a little greasy, but that was probably my only real nitpick with any of the dishes.\nThey also have the standard side sauces, raita and mint sauce. We could have eaten those all day long, with baskets of naan! For dessert, there was warm carrot halwah (very tasty, but a little odd to us; not quite a side dish; not quite a dessert); and one other selection. You'll have to look for the \""samia\"" (I've always known it as \""kheer\""), at the back of the salad table. It's not labeled as a dessert, and it's right next to the similar-looking raita sauce. If you aren't familiar with it, its a sweet milk and vermicelli-noodle pudding flavored with cardamom. I like mine with more cardamom, but this was a nice cool & sweet ending to a spicy lunch :-) \nWith one soda pop, our meal for 2 was about $25, and well worth it. Rather than cook just one main dish at home, we enjoyed being have a lot of good Indian food at one meal. Oh, and the employees were very friendly as well!"
1,"An awesome, somewhat-hidden gem in the Forum Shops.\n\nThe staff at the shop is excellent. Friendly, funny, full of suggestions but never pushy. There were samples a-plenty of both bars and truffles, and we wound up taking some truffles home ourselves... don't miss the Funk & Disco (banana) and make sure to give the \""iffier\"" flavors a try like Naga (curry)."
1,Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!
1,"Pleasantly surprised at this buffet! We got the all-day deal for about $38 drinks except liquor included. All the MGM places have that good deal while Harrah's has the all 24 all u can eat thing. But considering we were staying at Luxor, far from everything, and that the reviews were bad for that buffet, we didn't mind the walk and the extra $8 for Mandalay.\n\nBreakfast: To our suprise, we came here the week before Miss Universe and all the contestants were eating breakfast. All the guys in our group were happy. Selection was good. It was def a brunch as well. Fresh fruits, antipasto, and all those cold selections. Crusted salmon was good. Basics like sausage, pancakes, eggs were there along with flavored crepes and pancakes. Cottage cheese crepes were good. They was also a italian and carving station. Overall, pretty satified. \n\nLunch: Miss Universe contestants were there again. Happy campers to all. Food was good. Pretty standard buffet fair for lunch but it was good. They have sushi, not spectacular but if you need a decent sushi fix.. it'll do.\n\nNow for Dinner: PRIME RIB is a must. And everyone in our party agrees, it is def worth it for the prime rib alone. No miss universe here tho. haha. The salmon was there again. So i was happy along with the usual basics. Italian, chinese, and mexican buffet items. For ME though, the dessert section on the right side was so worth it. Many cakes, tarts, cookies, and cobblers to give you a sugar rush. Also cute sugar free items that tasted pretty good. \n\nOverall, you def get your money's worth. I don't know if it's b/c miss universe was there but I would go back to mandalay bay again."
1,"My wife loves their pizza, so there's four stars automatically.  But that's where we stop.  Too much inter-employee BS going on and not enough looking after the customer.  And the floor manager (guess that's what he was, he sure wasn't helping anybody) needs to go to attitude school.  We were lucky - very nice waitress.  But you have to wonder when she's talking to the table next to us, telling them she's looking for another job where she can make some money.  And, oh, yeah...they're believers in the \""use a tiny carafe to serve the wine - it looks like they're getting more\"" school."
1,I've been here many many times.  I always come back for their soft tofu soup.  They are inside the Greenland Korean grocery on Rainbow and Spring Mountain.  The sign on their stall actually says Tofu House but on their receipt it's Noodle Village.  For lunch I usually order their lunch combo of the tofu soup +  bibimbap or kalbi.  This will run for about $15.  I think this is good for 2 people.  I always come away full and happy.  The service is very friendly.  It's worth it to come here.
1,"Very modern and arty, Concrete Wardrobe is the kind of place that many would like to be seen visiting to kit out their accommodation, but in reality the cheap tat from IKEA will probably win out.\n\nHome furnishings aren't my speciality by any stretch of the imagination, but the impractical, oddball yet striking goods on sale in here at least make me glad such a shop exists."
1,The Cobb salad was really good. Loved the balsamic dressing. Ask for Daryl. Best waiter ever because he used to be a butler!!! He is finishing law school. Nice man.
1,"Staff is very respectful and the place is quiet. Been going here from referrals from UNLV whenever needed. Wait times can become long, but what can you expect? They do walk-ins, and all my visits have been for an x-Ray. Zach, the technologist does his job very well and they even give your images back on a disc in a hurry."
0,"Bad customer Service. They sell out of date items also. Way over priced as well, if your search a little better you can bet a better deal for the same item."
0,"Not worth your time. I'm the first to admit I'm spoiled by the sushi scene in Los Angeles, and I imagine this could be a swanky spot for an out of towner, but it's just not good. The prices are ridiculous considering portion size (4 half shell oysters for $17?) and the taste is nothing spectacular. The reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that the presentation was very nice. But there are many Japanese options on the strip and I would recommend going elsewhere for a seafood fix."
0,"The access to this station is terrible, there's very little room on the lot to move your car around, and it's always way too crowded.  I frequently end up circling the block a couple times and then heading over to Shell or the other GetGo on Penn in Wilkinsburg.\n\nThe only redeeming quality here is that you can use your FuelPerks for super-cheap gas, but you can do that at any other GetGo, too."
1,"On your way to red rock?  Hungry for some off the strip food?  Come in to this friendly waffle place with an Asian flare.  Have a yummy waffle breakfast sandwich and I'm sure you will be set for the rest of the climb on the rocks for the day!  Don't forget to get a side order of sausage and bubble tea, they're yummy!"
1,"Pop Deluxe is this small store on State Street that has some of the best office supplies.  If you're looking to spruce up your office and cubicle this is a place worth checking out.  Their stuff is unique and their prices are reasonable (they even have a website!)  \n\nI ended up walking out with a memo pad/mouse pad, some offensive pens, and some other cool office supplies.  I didn't notice their website until after I left but I'll definitely be dropping by next time I'm in Madison!"
0,Had a terrible experience this winter.  I wrote it up and it is not listed.  6 of us had a terrible time
0,Waited ten minutes for drink order to be taken. Then were told we had to wait because the kitchen was backed up. Then had to wait another 20 mins for check. Food was okay.
0,"The store overall is fine. If I need something at the last minute, I can rely on finding it here. The prices are slightly higher but if you shop the ads and use coupons you can get a better deal. The employees are cordial and checking out is pretty quick.  \n\nThe pharmacy is what I have a problem with.\n\nI like the convenience of their online service and the drive thru. The staff is helpful and they do follow thru when there are problems with getting your prescriptions refilled.\n\nMy concern is the accuracy of dispensing the medications.  I have been shorted a pill here and there. Once there was a typo error, lucky I caught and questioned it. They need stricter security measures too when picking up meds. Sometimes they ask you certain questions, sometimes they don't. There's such a high turnover rate of pharmacy staff here. It's never the same employee I deal with so how do they know they are giving the meds to the right person? It's pretty unsettling to the point I'll be switching to a different pharmacy."
1,"I literally could NOT STOP EATING! I ordered the Chenna Batura, otherwise, curried garbanzo beans with puffy bread or even easier, #33. It was so satisfying that I ordered a second one to go so I could take it home and indulge over the weekend. The decor and ambiance was not the greatest, but really, who cares when the food is to die for. I will be making this my official \""Place to go when I can not decided what I want to eat\"" because I know it will always be satisfying no matter what type of food I am in the mood for."
1,"Good decor and relaxed atmosphere.  Service was excellent - very friendly, engaging and attentive.  \n\nHad tomato basil soup to start which was quite good, and not served too hot.  Pulled pork sandwich was great, but the Kobe burger was better.  Will definitely be coming back."
1,"I came here on a Monday night at the recommendation of the Patio edition of the Yelp newsletter. When I walked in, I felt like I was walking into one of those old-time, dusty, quiet bars in the southwest, which isn't a bad thing. It was dark and had a dive-bar vibe, but a bit cleaner. We went straight out to the patio in the back and I was very pleased with the bright Mexican decor, lights and decorative high top tables. We took a seat, ordered an array of margaritas and beers and stayed for a few hours. The drink prices are decent for what you get, they had half price tacos, and great chips and salsa. It definitely doesn't break the bank! My favorite drink of the night was the El Rey margarita which has some chile de arbol in it, which gave it a spicy kick. I also had the La Chiquita Sarita which was a strawberry margarita on the rocks with muddled lime, but way more unique than it sounds. It was a close second to the El Rey for me. Try the Micheladas for a beer/margarita hybrid beverage. The only thing that bumped a star down for me was the service. It was a little haphazard, but still overall attentive."
1,"Lovely!!  One of the area's most amazing nature walks sits just five minutes south of downtown Phoenix.  Here, gritty urban industrial meets nature, solitude, singing birds and running water.  You'll frequently exclaim \""look! it's a bird!  It's a plane! \""  Literally.   \n\nAbundant bird life ( I spotted six white egrets, herons, cormorants, numerous waterfowl and birds of prey on a recent visit) as well as beaver, muskrat, coyote, rabbits.  Gorgeous stands of cottonwood trees and cattails that are just starting to grow back after the recent storms.  There are two levels of trails - a paved one that offers excellent panoramic views of the city skyline and south mountain range; and unpaved dirt-rock trails that lead you right into the river bottom.  Please be respectful of the request that dogs stay on the paved trails, as that is what helps preserve the amazing wild bird life that is here.  We counted 40 different kinds of birds on a recent walk.  \n\nThe preserve runs from 16 street to 19 ave, though the most visually interesting segment is central ave to about 15 ave.  Open sunrise to sunset with ample parking at central or 7th avenues.  Restrooms and water fountains and shade on the north side at both locations.  To cross to the other side of the river you must use the car overpasses at the major intersections, but there is safe pedestrian access in both directions.  The Audubon center on south side of central ave is also worth a brief visit.  Enjoy your stroll, hike, bike ride, birdwatching adventure, dog walk, or all of the above!"
0,"We visited on a Saturday evening. We had 4 adults and 4 children. The space is clean and well designed and interesting looking. \n\nWe ordered 2 beef sandwiches, several hot dogs, the meatball sub, a children's cheeseburger, and a side salad. The salad was fresh and Italian dressing was tasty. The hot dogs were definitely Chicago dogs although they weren't hot when we got them. The fries all came out hot and were good. \n\nThe beef sandwiches were quite dissapointing. The beef was visually unappealing- grey and limp looking. Quite frankly it was lacking any flavor, it mostly tasted old and microwaved. The \""gravy\"" was not flavorful either, it looked like it was going to taste good and homemade and was quite the opposite. My daughter said she wouldn't order the cheeseburger again. My son enjoyed the meatball sub and would order it again. \n\nOverall the hotdogs and fries would be worth visiting again to get a Chicago dog fix and seeing if the come out hot next time. The service and cleanliness warrant another visit but I won't give more than 2 stars because if the food."
0,"Rooms are beautiful.  The a/c in both the rooms I was in made high pitch noise that made hard to sleep.  The second night I turned the a/c down really low, then turned it off so I didn't have to hear it.  The first room I was in the a/c was not working correctly.  I called to the front desk and a very nice man came to my room at 12:38 am....he left and came back with a drill.  In the morning it was 59 degrees in my room.... I was freezing.  I was so sleepy from not resting well.  I spoke to the manager Paul that day and ask that my room be comped.  He said that nothing was wrong with the a/c, that the man fixed nothing when he was in the room, that the thermostat was set incorrectly.  I told Paul that I am 36 years old and I know how to work a thermostat.... he said \""Thank you so much for that information Ms.\""  To say he was  condensing  is a understatement.  offer 20% off room the first night.  The third night I had to call security 3 times because the room next room was having some amazing sexy time.  I was there for work and needed to sleep.  Security said they couldn't hear anything so didn't do anything about it.  When I checked out of the hotel the next day I spoke to a different manager who said the was no record that I called security...... like I was making it up.   I stay at hotels about every two weeks for work.  I have never had been treated the way I was treated at a hotel.  I will NEVER stay there again.  If I go to this event for work again I will stay at the Hampton Inn next door and walk over to the event.  \n\nI also was \""carded\"" to go up to my room.  This place is awful and not worth the money.\n\n$50 a day is held on your card for \""incidentals.\""   There not even a mini bar in the room..... towels?  I'm not sure what I could \""incidental.\""  \n\nI valeted and then I left for a little while the second day the turbo button was on, that can only come on by reaching all the way to the right of the dash board..... so it's not like someone could push it by accident.   Evidence would show that someone was having some fun in my car..... but like the fact that I called security 3 times.... I had no proof.\n\nThis is NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel.    Terrible experience and they totally didn't care. \n\n\nI did enjoy the Ocean restaurant there, and the bathtub..... pass on the rest."
1,"Hands up, hands down, hands absolutely anywhere BEST sandwich I'll probably ever eat. I stopped by here during my spring break and it was more memorable than any buffet I went to. When I hear Vegas, I think of Earl of Sandwich and the cute little sticker they place on your wrapped up package of heaven. I tried the Carribean Jerk and Hawaiian BBQ. Now that it's open 24 hours, I can't wait for it to be my first meal next time I go :]"
1,"Missing home (Hawaii)? Want saimin? Look no further. Every time I come to Vegas and stay downtown, I make a stop here for some local comfort food. This particular time, my family was stopping over on our way home after a weeklong vacation and I was craving some saimin. I was so excited and was not disappointed.\n\nSometimes the lines can be long to order, but it usually moves. Once you order, you get a number and have a seat at one of the tables. The food is brought to you. So satisfying.\n\nI've gotten other food here, but mostly just get their saimin. It's a nice little bit of home while you're away."
0,"Oh Lord...I have waited three months to write this review while enduring my husband's onslaught of \""It wasn't that bad\"" guilt trip, so I will just do the bullet points and stick to the facts.\n\nIn town to celebrate our 10th anniversary, my husband who loves anything to do with the Mob, decided that THIS place would be authentic and real. Okay, dude, whatever. \n\nWhat we liked:\n~John Brooks, the BEST Elvis impersonator we've seen in a long time. He is in the lounge on the weekends and brings loving fans and family....excellent show. \n~The $5 Burger and Beer special in the caf\u00e9...cheap and our servers were very nice. \n~KISS slot machines\n~Front desk who greeted us and worked with us while we were there. \n~Close to a decent coffee shop and a couple of blocks from the Fremont Experience. \n~The security team who tried hard to help me when my phone was stolen but admitted that even if I found it on a GPS, they couldn't do anything. Thank God they were still polite and professional. \n\n\nWhat we HATED:\n~Parking is cheap but we had a run in with a young Asian parking guard who decided to get macho when we didn't STOP when we came in. Bear in mind that we had been in and out several times by that time and were waved in each trip by the professional parking guard. \n~There are two parts of the hotel, one is the towers, which is like a conventional hotel and the other which resembles an older version of a Motel 6...guess where we stayed?\n~The room was VERY humble and clean, no bedbugs thank God but it is VERY disabled, older person unfriendly. The bathtub has high walls so it was difficult for my parents to get in and out without help. The floors leading to the rooms are uneven and rough, again a challenge for older people. \n\n\nTHE WORST PARTS:\n\n****We stayed on the top floor and it wasn't until my daughter came up with the two grandkids did I notice that the \""fencing\"" surrounding each floor were neither up to code or safe. In fact they were VERY unsafe....If we had not held onto the hands of our grandchildren who are 5 and 2, they could have easily slipped through the railing and to a serious injury if not, to their death. \nOnce you are older and not prone to running over to look over the edge of a railing, you don't notice what a dangerous/tragic situation it could be****\n\n~DO NOT stay on the East side of the Motel 6 part of the hotel. At the end of the May there was a hip hop club across the street and the crappy, building shaking, ghetto ass, worse rap I've ever heard, went onto until 4 AM. I was told by the desk agent that there is no close time so they could've technically played until dawn. The street was full of racing ghetto whips, I totally expected gunshots to ring out all night long. No one slept except the grandkids who finally just passed out. \n\nWhen I went down the to front desk that early morning, the girl was very nice but could not do a thing. She gave me the business card of the desk manager who NEVER contacted me. It wasn't until I sent an email to the General Mgr that we ever received a response. He apologized and offered us one night in the tower and one night in the Motel 6 side IF we ever came back.\n\nYou totally get what you pay for and I imagine we go what we deserved because the room was dirt cheap. I would rather sleep in my car then allow any one of my family members to ever stay there. A VERY disappointing experience, stay at your own risk and what your little ones."
1,Stumbled onto this place while looking for a thai restaurant! We sure were happy! All you can eat dinner was great! Sweet shrimp was so good! Sashimi was fresh. The oyster shooter was impeccable! The UNI was super fresh and good! Service was great! The only thing that will make this place much better is if they do a better job with the rice. It needs to be cooked a bit longer and warm.
1,can't help but be a regular.  great employees and patrons.  a great laid-back hangout
0,"Honestly nothing special. People still eat there don't ask me. Food Is Bland Theye Skimp On Hummus, man dunk the stuff on my plate it's good for me I want more of it. This place give soo little hummus, nothing really memorable. ..."
1,"Some friends and I had dinner at Envy a few weeks ago during a Vegas weekend trip.  The restaurant is located off the strip in the Renaissance Hotel which looks like your run of the mill business hotel.  I was actually surprised to find a steakhouse located inside. The interior of the restaurant has a nice, rich decor and pleasant ambiance.  \n\nThe service was attentive and friendly. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable and helpful in recommending two bottles of white and red wines for our table.  \n\nOur party of 8 ordered the following items:\n\nBourbon Creamed Corn\nHands down the BEST creamed corn I've ever had.  It was mouth wateringly rich but not overly creamy and flavored with so much goodness.  The waiter had noted that this was the most popular dish on the menu and I completely understand why.  We originally had two orders of this dish but it was devoured pretty quickly so we ordered another.\n\nTruffle Fries\nTasty stick fries with truffle.  A very substantial serving - one order would have been plenty for our table but I'm quite sure we ordered two. \n\nBacon Gruyere Mashed Potato\nPretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nEntrees:\n\nGinger LIme Sea Bass\nI opted for the sea bass since it came recommended by one of our friends.  It was a very light dish in flavor and moist throughout.  The portion was quite generous as well.\n\nBone-in Ribeye\nMy boyfriend ordered the bone-in ribeye which we thought was only decent at best.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.\n\nOverall, ENVY steakhouse is worth a visit if you're looking for a nice meal off the strip.  The bourbon creamed corn absolutely blew us all away and remains the most memorable part of our dinner.  I'd go back just for that dish!"
0,"The front counter people were very friendly & it was my first time so I was very thrilled about trying this gym out. They introduced me to a blonde lady who handles memberships. First off she did not even shake my hand or introduce herself to me. She just told me to take a seat and began badgering me with interview questions like, 'why mountainside? what's interesting about it?' Like IDK! Isn't that your job?! You tell me! She had this rude, snobby attitude and talked down at me like I was stupid. I couldn't listen to her bs anymore so I just stormed out. Worst experience at a gym. Never going back unless it's to kick her behind! I'd give it zero stars if I could!"
1,Sehr gutes Bier und das beste Steak in Karlsruhe und Umgebung. Nur einen Tisch muss man fast immer reservieren.
1,"It's not the worst, but it's not exactly great to be at the DMV. I think it's gotten busier over the years as the NW has gotten more people and word spreading that it was the least busy that now it is full each time. The numbers are called out at a decent pace as there are 30 something windows and the amount of windows open is quite a bit. \n\nIf you have something easy to take care of - check if it can't be done online or at one of the many kiosks and outposts at grocery stores, or the machines outside of the building. Frees up your time and lessens the queue of people so don't be stupid, check it out! Technology is your friend. \n\nDepending on your issue some number categories have a ton of people under it \""G\"". IDs seem to suck just because there is only one window doing I numbers. H is for handicapped and handicapped related DMV documents like your blue tags or medicinal cards. \n\nI was here for H (fuck you, don't laugh) and the visit was about an hour. Wasn't the worst I've ever waited and I was fine. The BF doesn't agree, but he was complaining 5 minutes in about being there....I think it's contagious and just in the air. You get caught up with the DMV angst when you were totally fine waiting for an hour for a table, for your car, for a doctor, etc. \n\nIt's probably one of our more efficiently run DMVs so I'll give them so rare kudos and love."
1,This mall is pretty cool. They have a lot of stores and they have a super huge 2 story forever 21 which is one of my favorite stores. I can also find a last minute outfit for the night when I stop by this mall. So much variety in shopping stores and food stores. I saw when they had a fashion show one time and they stage goes into the ground when it's over. Fancy.
1,"Awesome spot! Every service I've ever had here has been top notch. The place is clean, inviting, friendly, and elegant enough to make you feel like you're not just in another corner nail salon... but casual enough so you feel like you can pop in wearing jeans and a pony tail and not be 'sized up' by the staff. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, every gal/guy who has taken care of me has been kind, a good communicator, and generally pleasant. The owner is a wonderful man. I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about this spa. Prices are great. Gel nails last forever. Easy to get to (unlike spas in casinos). The list goes on...\n\nHighly recommend."
1,I eat here often..... The food is always fresh and it's close to my house.... Getting a little pricey but still worth it.
0,"All the negative reviews are spot on. I was quoted $900 for springs and was told they don't have it but can use two smaller springs joined head to toe. This was the most laughable idea and the only reason is because they carry the cheaper springs and just want the deal closed on the spot as they know the minute I shop, they will not get the job. Why is that you wonder? Well on Google the so call custom springs are $41-$48 each so for $90 plus shipping of $30,they wanted $900!!! I had another company came out and did it in less than 2 hours for $350. 1/3 of what these guys wanted!!!! so they want to price their labor at $385 an hour? To make matter worse, someone had opened my motor housing and sabotage the gears ( wonder who that could be ???). Fortunately the other company discovered it and showed me someone had open the housing and moved the gears, they fixed it and even adjusted my other garage door motor for free as it took 2 extra minutes. So what they quoted $900 cost me 350 and took less than 2 hours and that is with correcting the mystery gear that moved on its own and courtesy adjustment of an unrelated garage door !!\nAll in all this company is what gives trades people a bad name, a total gypsy outfit and no matter what deal they made you after the initial quote, it is too much as they started with such a sky high price even at half they were overcharging it and that is reflected in all the other yelp reviews. There are many company out there and they all come the same day and do the work in a few hours so don't feel you are at their mercy!!!!!!!"
1,"If you want great New Orleans Style food at a great price off the Vegas Strip, this is a must. The place is near Fremont in quaint Bourbon St. like place playing Zydeco music. The Cajun cuisine is probably better than even Bourbon St. in New Orleans! The Gumbo appetizer was almost a meal with generous portions of shrimp. The Red Beans and Rice was huge and had plenty of sausage.  Staff were excellent and very friendly. I will definitely include this in my next visit."
0,"This hotel is well located on the edge of old Montreal. But, it is tired, the staff are helpful, concierge staff are great. checking in was not great.  Used Expedia to book the room and did not get the room we booked. We were told it was because we used expedia... You are treated like a second class guest. room was tired. Bathroom door had rusty hinges, sink cracked, only one bed when we booked for three adults. The did provide a cot for the other adult.\nReally tough to recommend the hotel but if you stay the concierge staff are great."
1,"I booked a birthday party 01/02/15 for my 3 year old son and it was the best party yet! I have had several chuck e cheese parties for my children over the years , but this one was better than any other . My party host Jason was amazing . The general manager came over as soon as we arrived and gave us a cup FULL of token on the house ! Our host played with the birthday boy, gave us more tickets and tokens than we payed for & went above and beyond to provide a fantastic experience .. Granted the pizza was the standard chain type pizza  (I am paying for the experience , not the cheap food) . they were slow at the time so we Didn't get kicked out of the party area as soon as our 2 hour time limit wAs up. I highly recommend Jason as your party host , and to Book your party at a slower time so you can reap the benefits ."
1,"I went here for Mother's Day brunch and it was excellent.  This place definitely does not serve up your typical breakfast/lunch fare.  Everything is pretty unique and delicious.  The crowd is always great as is the general vibe of the place especially the patio area when the weather is nice.  Coming from Tempe I just love the DC Ranch area especially Market Street.  Anyway, about the food:\n\n* Egg with salmon hash - I think this was special for Mother's Day.  It sounded weird and I don't know why I ordered it, but I was glad I did.  It was like corned beef hash except with fresh salmon instead of corned beef and little real potatoes instead of the tiny potato things in normal hash.  It was excellent.  \n\n* Red Velvet Pancakes - HOLY SH*T!  Best-Pancakes-EVER!  Enough said.\n\n* Sweet Potato Chips - Some of the best I've ever had.\n\n* Low Fat Banana Bread  - Pretty good, but low fat?  Yeah right. \n\nThe service was pretty good but was a bit slow at times.  Probably because it was so busy due to the holiday.  They also aren't very happy with custom orders so just stick to what is on the menu."
0,I love Pane Bianco--but sadly they have priced me out of their market  for the most part when it comes to sandwiches.  $13 for their tuna sandwich is outrageous--and beyond a price point that I am willing to pay under any  circumstances.  At 9 or even 10 I thought it was reasonably fair and allowed for a tip--at $13  it is not affordable and there is nothing left over for a tip.  I am so sorry that I won't be having lunch there anymore with any kind of frequency.
1,"****Review of the Casino Only!****\n\nMy friends and I had the most wicked fun time gambling at this place.  I can't imagine a better group of people I would rather lose my money to!  We played craps and blackjack mostly so the drinks were free flowing.  Darina, our cocktail waitress, was so sweet!  Marie, our blackjack dealer in the Champagne Pit, had us singing and high-five'ing everyone at our table.  The craps dudes were all fun, gave good advice and were all around fun (well, except Glen...he was a bit of a hardass.)  I really had an awesome time here.  I won't be staying at the hotel anytime soon after reading the other yelp reviews tho I highly recommend going to throw your money down at the casino."
0,"We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration with 3 other couples and spent over $700.  Service was great but the food was terrible.  appetizers were small and overpriced.  We had the calamari, loco moco,  canoe and ribs.   the only appetizer everyone raved about were the ribs but the rest were horrible.  We ordered several entrees including short ribs, butterfish, salmon, pork shank and curried chicken.  Other than the fish entrees, there were alot of leftover foods and no one wanted to take home any because no one wanted to eat any of the food twice.  We skipped desserts, no one wanted to try any.  Drinks were great and again, service was great.   Not a good nor memorable experience at Roy's for us unfortunately."
1,I always have a great time gambling here!!!
0,"Chris wanted to go back to Il Fornaio but I wanted to try something new while we were away, big mistake. When we approached the podium the servers seemed confused, which I cannot find any reason for, you work at a restaurant we want to sit down....what's the mystery? They got it all worked out an sat us. There were bread plates on the table but no bread ever made it to us. Chris ordered the Lamb Stew. The broth/stock was excellent. The concept was good-clean simple flavors- but the execution was a miss for us. The lamb, carrots and potatoes were cut in chunks way WAY to big to fit on the spoon or eat in one bite. It is inconvenient to have to cut something in or bite into something from a soup. I ordered the salmon salad with the dressing on the side, but some other salad with pickles and chicken came out with the dressing on it. I didn't want to send it back so I just ate it. The dressing was light and tangy. It was a little too sour with the pickles. Actually the pickles in the salad were not good all together. We will be back this summer, staying in the Venetian and Nine Fine Irishmen will not be on our check list."
1,"One of the biggest Walgreens I've been to. It sells premade salads, sandwiches, fruit platters etc. They also have a juice bar!\n\nI've been here twice now for fresh smoothies. It's been hard finding smoothies made with fresh fruit and no added sugar on the strip. They let you customize it with as many or as little ingredients you want for the same price.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the machines dont blend the smoothies perfectly and there's usually chunks at the bottom.\n\nI'd go back for another smoothie any day!"
0,"I have been coming here for over ten years, after this current experience it's my last visit. The service was the worst service I have ever had. After waiting through our whole meal and never getting a refill or half of our orders correct we called over a manager, explained the situation and his response was \""what would you like me to do about it\"" no apology just offering us a free desert. Whoopee! Not that I was looking for anything free, but made me realize that a local joint would of appreciated our money over this corporately ran dump!"
1,"Ever since the Elite Event at Orange Theory, I've been looking for any excuse to come back and nosh at Flower Child. \n\nA long three months later, the opportunity presented itself on my way back from some meetings.\n\nYeah, it's that delicious. Locally sourced food made with love. \n\nYou order at the counter, and are given a number. \n\nTake a seat anywhere, the staff will find you and your number even if you go on the patio! \n\nSince I had been CRAVING the Mediterranean Salad with a healthy portion of Salmon, I didn't try something new.   \n\nIt's the perfect blend of greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, garbanzo beans and lightly dressed with feta and an oregano vinaigrette. \n\nThis is what I love about Flower Child: Simple ingredients are the star on their own, without being drowned out in cheeses or sauces. \n\nAlso, the seasonal Apple Cider Lemonade was phenomenal. Was not expecting that combination to work! \n\nCan't wait to try the rest of the menu."
1,"I had the Alaskan King Crab Legs, Mac Cheese, Spinach, & Onion Rings. Everything was delicious! Best onion rings I've ever had - with a hot sauce that was perfect with them. The crab legs came with butter that was warmed by an underneath flame. \n\nThe waiter was attentive. However, the man who brought the wine brought the wrong kind instead of just telling us the one we wanted was no longer available & offering comparable options."
0,"Overhyped. I was disappointed with everything--the fries, Pitts-Burger and buffalo wings. Why is this place so famous?"
0,"Rude service.  They blame all their mistakes on the \""teamsters\"".  Horrible union based company that cannot take any responsibilities for their own actions.  If I had a choice I would never use them again but whats the use in complaining when they already have contracts with all the convention halls."
0,"They wrecked my car twice. 1st it was the bumper, and like an idiot I took my car back and they wrecked the passenger mirror. What a joke!! Customer service is atrocious!! They look forward to telling you to bad!!"

0,"I go here all the time when i am at desert ridge. I love watching movies here but it is freezing in the movie. The staff are extremely strict (which i understand) but i was in an R rated movie with my dad. He went to go get popcorn and a staff member came in asking for my ID and ticket. I told him that my dad was out getting popcorn and i had to wait for him until he came back. Also, I was in a PG-13 movie and they also asked for my ticket... Last time i was here the manager followed me into my movie theater. I get how they have to be strict and not have minors see R movies but i don't understand why i get \""watched\"" every time I go here. Definitely lost my business..."
1,"Delicious and inventive!! \n\nSometimes I'm wary of fusion food and \""modern\"" cuisine when the concept compromises actual taste. Yonaka did an impeccable job of bringing new flavors to traditional Japanese foods, incorporating fresh ingredients from around the world. \n\nWe tried the ten course tasting menu, ordering two sets for our table of six and were not disappointed!  Each dish was impeccable in taste and presentation. The meal built perfectly, nothing was too heavy so we could enjoy every course. The flavors were all unique, with combinations like Hokkaido scallops with strawberries, black pepper, and cilantro. Who knew how delicious that could taste?!!  Even the simple starter, watermelon with fish sauce and mint~ was perfect in taste and timing. The unique taste grabbed our attention and got us psyched to try whatever was coming next. There was blue fin tuna, yucca and kale chips, red radishes, grilled potatoes, delicate sauces all craftily combined for perfect bites. We had unique sashimi, flying fish included! All great. \n\nBy the 8th course, we were definitely getting full. The 9th course was a dashi/rice/egg/stew kinda delicious concoction, that easily filled up anyone who was somehow still hungry.  And the desserts were pieces of art (we had two different types, with many delightful combinations on each plate-- mango mousse and coconut, strawberry mint ice cream, green tea brownie, strawberry chocolate milk.... YUM). It wasn't too sweet, which our indulged bellies appreciated. \n\nThe decor is simple and elegant, service was timely, friendly, and each dish was explained thoroughly (a tough task with all those ingredients and courses)!\n\nAlso, the fresh ginger ale was perfect and helped me digest all the amazing food Yonaka served up!!  Thanks for a memorable meal!"
1,"Another Ramen spot added to the Vegas scene. One that heard lot of great things about and happy finally got to check out. I came here with some friends visiting from the 808. I was telling them about new Ramen spot in town. I had my worries cause back home Ramen is almost as common as Spam musubi. So pleasing the local boys would be tough. JINYA never missed a beat 808 style.\n\nI remember years ago the building that JINYA in changed few times over the years. My last memories thinking was fast food chain. So walking into the restaurant was totally different world. I like the whole revamp look from the interior the lighting fixtures, the huge community table is different, still have your booths, also have small but tradition Ramen Bar area with bar stools (have your own private show of sorts watching the chefs at work), all the bowls Ramen serve in screams personality, the sake box of sorts that the tempura brussel sprouts served in, and even the outside clearly stands out. The fact that it opens till 3am...\n\nJINYA not very big place but then again most Ramen spots here in Vegas not that big. So if you go when busy expect to wait or do like three of us did community table. We started with tow appetizers the JINYA bun and the Tempura Brussel Sprouts. The JINYA bun was ok. I was thinking more along the line of peking duck with oyster sauce in steamed bun. It amounted too was charsu in steamed bun. I needed sauce or something bring personality to the dish. The brussel sprouts that was amazing!! Honestly after having the brussel sprouts give regular traditional shrimp tempura bad name. The brussel sprouts was perfect nice al dente and hot inside. The tempura batter was perfect consistency not over heavy or light. It had the right amount of coating, flavor, and the truffle oil on top took it to another level. Appetizer that must in restaurant this is one highly recommend. Addicting we crushed it between three of us. \n\nI went with the Tonkatsu Spicy. It had nice kick. I love the broth had so much depth and mention the kick again. If not enough they have different spicy condiments on the table. I love all the stuff that on top of the Ramen. You get nice size portion of noodles in the bowl. The bowl deceiving cause lip of the bowl not wide but deep bowl. I know had noodles till the end. \n\nThe menu has great diversity. Few more appetizers that looked (lot of the items have picture on the menu) good! The Ramen again diversity even have vegetarian one. One of the best things about the menu. They offer combinations with choice of appetizer plus ramen. The catch is can only go with the combinations they offer. Still something that can not think of other Ramen spots that offer it. Ramen and gyoza that must for me. I got the best of both worlds. The homemade gyoza was awesome. The combination gyoza you only get four pieces instead of regular order of six. \n\nThe service was excellent. She was on it the whole time."
0,"Tried this place out and was a bit disappointed.   I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was dry, even after adding sauces.  I could have just caught them on a bad day, but still.\n\nAlso, I have never seen a BBQ place that does not have brisket on the menu.\n\nOn the positive side, the hush puppies and mac n cheese were great.\n\nOn the odd side, my daughter's kids meal was a larger portion than my Large pulled pork sandwich meal."
1,I would give this place 5 stars but every time I do yelp thinks its fake.  This place is great and fast.  People are always very nice.  It's fast enough I can run over there and grab lunch on my 30 min break.
0,"Service started out okay, but after we were served it went down hill. No water refills and after asking twice for a fork and napkins we still never got them. I wanted to like this place because of the good reviews but the service ruined it for us. We were never asked if we needed anything, we just sat there waiting for them to come to our table and towards the end we got what we needed by waving at them. Will not be back."
1,"So I take my 3 cats to McClintock Animal Care Center, and this place really knows how to take care of their furry clients! Whenever I take them in, all the staff is willing to answer any questions or concerns I may have even if it's not about any issue my cat may have. The staff is awesome, and a friend works here too. That was a pleasant and unexpected surprise last visit! \n\nThe only thing is that it is a little more expensive than some other facilities. I wish there was a way to get some more discounts for bringing in my 3 furry companions to make sure they are okay and normal checkups. Still, the facility is nice, everyone is nice and helpful. So even though they make me go broke, I can't imagine my kitties going anywhere else."
0,"If you are on a salt restricted diet, don't eat here! Everything is over salted and some is actually so salty it is inedible!!!"
0,"I've decided to review all the buffets on the strip, starting with this one.\n\nBoy, what a disappointment.\n\nThe Bay Side Buffet at Mandalay Bay is expensive and the choices are minimal...but at the very least, you don't have to wait in line long for seating.  I couldn't find a single thing I liked here, including the dessert bar, which is a rare thing for me.  Of course, half of it caters to seafood (that being the hotel's theme) and I don't eat fish, so it was probably a waste for me.\n\n$20 for lunch is way too much for this place.  Try somewhere else instead."
1,Easy walking access from strip or fashion show mall. Have dined here twice. Both times enjoyed the chicken tacos. Authentic fresh corn tortillas. Fresh chicken. Good flavor. Typical Vegas prices. I suggest spending $3 and getting the endless chips and salsa- worth it.
1,"What can I say...I absolutely love this place.  I have been here so many times and have eaten thru the menu probably.  The kalbi burger is by far my fave...the kimchi and spicy mayo...yummy.  I also love the $3 pickles as a starter...and they have boba.  Awesome!  I probably go to this place because although some of the servers this is their first job and need a little coaching they are supernice and its open til 2:00 am most days so another plus on my list.  We live in Las Vegas, the 24 hour place, but too many place close way to early and if you go to eat around 9:00..whoa bad attitude people.  This place is nice too, cause you don't have to trek thru a mob of smokers and bright little machines to get there.  Told you I love this place. :)  My only wish is that they mix up the menu a little more with more specials to suit the season and local ingredients."
1,"I LOVE that Jet Blue is flying from Burbank to Vegas again!  It makes me so happy that there is an alternative from Southworst.  You get to pick your own seats, No cattle calls, and TV!! OMG a lifesaver.  Everyone should fly Jet Blue and support them!  More trips to come!"
0,Aweful!  We had a reservation at Capital Grille however concierge service at Ritz Carlton suggested we change to Five Church.  The staff is very pleasant. The ambiance is average.  The food is less then average and bland.  The menu is limited.  It was very disappointing.
0,Place was out of Duck at 7pm on a Tuesday. Rest of food was mediocre including BBQ pork ribs and fried rice. Vegetables were good. My friend got sick after his meal. Definitely disappointed after reading other reviews.
0,"50 dollars for a 3 pound poodle puppy cut, kinda excessive..."
1,"Oh so yummy. The stuffed dates and then little potato croquettes. So good. We had been to the other location and the sit to go here as much shorter, which was nice!  The sangria is tasty and the food is pretty dang delicious. Definitely recommend."
1,"The Good:\n- Good location in the heart of the strip with easy access to other City Center hotels and shopping.\n-  Contemporary comfortable rooms with a cool shower and tub combination room.\n-  Friendly professional service from every staff member I interacted with.\n-  Large casino with all the must haves\n-  Numerous dining options\n-  Got a AWESOME price on Priceline, $75 a night\n\nThe Bad:\n-  Nothing bad in particular but those seeking a luxurious vegas hotel like the Bellagio or Venetian may not like the decor and feel of Aria."
1,"Here's the thing. A burger is a burger is a burger. You can get somewhat creative but at the end of the day, it's still a burger. So there's nothing particularly remarkable about the menu, on which burgers are the predominant item. Where the food does stand out though is the freshness and preparation: grass-fed beef and fresh veggies. What made my visit worth it was the fresh shattered potato chips served with a side of tart, creamy lebni. So highest marks for being creative with potatoes!!!!\n\nThe menu also has a few sandwiches and salads plus beer, wine and sangria. I REALLY hope that they start serving breakfast because it would be a great place to start the day. It's tiny but cheerful.....like a small diner complete with a circular counter around the open kitchen with some outdoor seating. Everyone working there is very friendly and light-hearted and they play good music which all really make this an enjoyable place to eat. I can imagine having brekky here with the morning sun coming in. (hint, hint, LGO!)\n\nParking is limited so keep that in mind!"
0,"My father used to tell me that if you want to know how hygienic a restaurant's kitchen is, take a look at their bathroom. Because if a place can't be bothered to keep a customer-facing facility like the restroom clean, what makes you think they'll hold half as much regard for the back end?\n\nFlat Top's was not the worst case I've ever seen, but I did want to run far out of that bathroom the second I walked into it. The same could be said of the whole restaurant...it had this ugly open-air setup which felt like a cafeteria lined with tacky decorations.\n\nHowever my main issue is with the food. The meat was tough and had a paper-like consistency. All the sauces tasted the same. The whole meal was dry, flavorless, and just plain tough to eat. But the most truly unforgivable offense was the blatant disregard for food safety. The buffet from which you pick your food for frying is a disgusting mess.\n\nWhen you hand your selection of meat and vegetables to the cooks, you stick a wood marker in the food to identify it as yours. My marker was handed to them inside a bowl full of raw meat. When the food was brought out to me, that same marker was sticking out of my meal!\n\nI ended up picking at my food at the sides of the bowl away from the marker, and throwing the whole thing away.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then, whether it was a case of cross-contamination or not, that I spent the rest of the day fighting a pretty serious stomachache."
1,Best chaat and veg. Indian food in Phoenix for really low prices!  The ordering system is a little weird (you fill out a form and bring it into the kitchen) but you can order over the phone and the food will be ready for you.  \n\nI would give them 5 stars but its a messy store and they don't have any meat options for carnivores like me.  Be sure to try their desserts as well!  I recommend bringing an Indian friend along to help with ordering.
1,"This place was great.  I went with a friend who has a baby boy and they were accommodating with a high chair even though we didn't ask for one.  The only reason this was not 5 stars was because we went on a Saturday at 6pm and the place was packed.  We had to wait 25 minutes before getting a table for 6.  Also, the parking was full, which added to the wait time.  There is a valet attendant, who was a bit helpful.\n\nNow, onto the food!  We stared with the baked chicken wings and it tasted hot and fresh.  It came with a fair amount veggies (celery sticks and blueberries) as well.\n\nWe ordered the Mushroom Party w/ chicken sausage, Classic Margherita, and Mother Earth.  Mushroom Party was just okay.  I love mushrooms, but the flavors didn't grab my taste buds as the other two did.  Classic Margherita was my favorite.  The tomatoes and their sauce was a great fusion of flavors despite not having any meat.  Hint: use the parmesan to enhance the cheese flavor even more.  The Mother Earth was also tasteful if you are a fan of broccoli and olives.  One of us had a cheese allergy, so we had this one without cheese and it still tasted great.\n\nWe shared the the Duvel Golden Ale growler which was much cheaper than each of us ordering an individual pint.  It was enough for about 5 and a half glasses.  So, 16 bucks vs 6 bucks a pint.  Which would you prefer?\n\nOverall, great atmosphere and would recommend you give it a try.  Service was attentive with drinks and boxes despite the large crowd and customers were not to rowdy or out of control.  This place works for both social or family outings."
1,"Huge selection of Quebec beer, good prices, knowledgable staff. Always a great place to wander the aisles and pick up a few interesting beers. They also sell glasses, shirts, and hot sauce made with beer for the beer fanatic in your life.  \n\nJust a word of warning though - if you're looking for American craft beer, or even craft beer from the rest of Canada, you won't be able to find it here. Nor will you be able to find it anywhere in this province."
0,"I Must start with saying that I Can't Believe what has happened to this place! My father and I used to frequent WOK BO for years initially after them opening! The good \""WAS\"" great the service \""WAS\"" great and the quality was top notch. Over the past couple years they have been dwindling down Quality and Service have become BIG Issues! They have a man I apologize I can't remember his name a younger guy. Since he has been there They have lost all of our business! He is cocky and a complete smart A$$. My apologies but there is no other way to put it! He really could care less if you have or had a problem. He is nice upfront until an issue arises! We have received wrong partial orders and orders that have been half wrong half right when we ordered delivery recently trying to give wok BO another chance. After a \""FEW\"" wrong orders one evening I decided to call it back in. After The delivery took 45mins beyond what we were told initially I got nothing but attitude from the young man and was told that What I received is what I ordered. No it wasn't! Still had the paper that we write our orders on and called in with. After I was politely told by him that I must have thought we ordered the other stuff he says that they will send the driver back out but would be about an hour and asked for us to pay the 5.47 difference in price and return the other meal. Maybe it's just me but that's bad business! We had 3 people there to eat as I explained to him and now for everyone to eat together there food would be cold as well as the inconvenience. This happened several times recently as I have said but the COMPLETE ATTITUDE this young man always has when there is a problem makes thus past Friday my last meal from them. Mrs. Nancy and her husband(Assuming they are still the owners) that owned wok Bo are great people I only hope that they see how detrimental to the business this guy is before its to late! I would live to have the old wok-Bo back it was by far a favorite but my business will not return until this young man is gone! Many others I know have had the same sorts if problems with him and will not return either. So much for an 8+ years of being a customer!"
1,"The owners have been doing this for 35 years I'm told... they decided they are simply done with it. They plan to stay open for a couple more months - selling things off at big discounts. \n\nThis is a wonderful store and it's definitely a shame to be losing it. The store is filled to the rafters in old and new books. They also have a hodge podge of various trinkets and whatnot. You can get antique doorknobs here, random golf clubs or old 35mm cameras. It's somewhat of an antique shop, but mostly a book store. \n\nWhether you have been there before or not, you really owe it to yourself to check it out. Even if you don't buy anything, just go. If you have been there before - go take one last look around... tell them you appreciate them. \n\nWalking into the store is like getting hugged by grandma - go hug it back."
1,"This is a great store to visit..especially if you are visiting from out of town and are looking for something healthy to eat...fantastic salad bar on offer...but there is a fantastic selection of ready to eat foods on offer...\nSushi,Korean BBQ,Pizza,subs and sandwiches,soups,hot dishes..I could go on but best to go there and try it out as I did when staying in Vegas for a few weeks...loved it...."
1,"Came here on opening night, so of course the line was long. Like waiting in a Disneyland line, but the ride was worth the wait. \n\nI never knew a me-me-me, a melt like this(common- \""the light\""). steak patty melts- original. I was torn between the pepper-jack pattymelt and the peppercorn pattymelt, so I ordered the peppercorn with pepper-jack cheese. Yes! the sourdough bread was as it should, crispy and golden, and rich. the steak was good, but it wasn't booming as i thought it'd be. but overall, it filled me up to the last penny, and i was definitely satisfied.\n\ni ordered the turtle shake. wow, very good. shake at its optimal behavior. the regular size is pretty good, i think it's sharable though, even after eating a generous portion of my meal. i'd say, and this includes the calorie conscious fokls, half a glass would've sufficed for me. needless to say, i did finish the shake. most like the best part of the dinner. \n\nthe service was good, which closes the deal."
0,"The Pink's in Southern California is another one of my bookmarked businesses. And again the franchise opened another location in Las Vegas. \n\nLocated right on the busy Las Vegas Blvd strip and in the Planet Hollywood resort, there are no indoor seating, but plenty of outdoor seating. A great view of the strip and the Bellagio Hotel located across the street. \n\nI had one of their unique hot-dogs-\""Three Dog Night\"". For $8.25, I get three skinny hot dogs wrapped with bacon and chlli, cheese and chopped red onions in a flour tortilla. This gourmet hot dog is featured on Triple-D in So-Cal and Guy Fieri considered this hot dog, \""MONEY\"". But my hot dog is nowhere as good as his, where my slices of bacon was \""undercooked\"" and not crispy. I still prefer the Bacon Dog Cart on Mission St in San Francisco any given day. \n\nThe only positive thing about the small hot dog place is that I get to see the fountain show at the Bellagio while eating my subpar snack. \n\nI'll still go to the Pink's in Southern California and check out other items though.\n\nThree Dog night: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T0Uw6vwwfO3el29wBoDamQ?select=ZPkgzbo64jO7u91BF6eXsA"

I can't recommend this place enough.\n\nHe gave my dress boots a great polish, gave me some pointers on caring for them a little better AND even taught be a better way to tie them.\n\nI'm 31 and this guys is teaching me to tie my shoes? Awesome.\n\nThis stand is over 25 years old and experience counts."
1,"Went back to Centurion after a wonderful day at the San Tan Wheelie Jam.  My friend and I were famished from all of our bike riding.  I called shortly before we left my house and made a reservation.  When we arrived, they seated us at a sofa, which was ok for drinks, but we requested to be moved to a table for our entrees.  They waitstaff was accommodating.  I got an item that's not on the menu, but was recommended by our server at my first visit to Centurion: gnocchi with white Irish cheddar sauce.  The waitress had to check with the chef, who said he would make it.  Oh, rich yummy goodness!  My friend had a pizza, and as on a previous visit, I felt I had the better experience by ordering their pasta.  Our waitstaffers were relaxed and flexible on this Saturday night.  Once again, I had a wonderful dining experience at Centurion."
0,The food is awesome. I love the fish tacos and the creamy chipotle chicken. The only downside to the restaurant is the servers & the cleanliness... Or lack there of..if the waitress's became a little nicer and the restaurant a little cleaner..I think they would increase in ratings and business.
1,"Just stopped in for the Honey Chicken Lunch Bowl, the Sweet & Spicy soup, with a Carrot Cake chaser for desert,  all served by Justin...EXCELLENT !!"
0,"The game was great and the the crowd was fun.  The vendors are always in the way, they are rude and they really don't care if they prevent you from watching the game.    I would like to see them move the team out of Cashman field and to Summerlin then maybe the vendors will be better."
1,"I love Churascarias.  Having visited Rio and Sao Paulo, I think I know what a good one is.  The waiters and gauchos were very attentive.  The price point is a good value compared to nationwide chains like Fogo de chao and Texas du Brazil.  I will be back here again on my future visits to Madison."
1,"Love this place! I love sashimi and it's surprisingly fresh here. Living in Hawaii I was skeptical at how good this place was since it was outside of the strip. Love the AYCE price, can't beat it. Everything is good from the hamachi, Toro, hotate, soft shell crab, uni and oysters on the half shell! I always make it a point to come here when I'm in sin city. Sushi chefs are cool too."
0,"Organ Stop Pizza is a childhood favorite of mine. We visited this location as well as the downtown Phoenix location before it for years. Now that I live in the far west valley, it's been, easily 10 years since I last visited OSP.  We happened to be in the neighborhood for a Convention so we brought a large group of friends to experience OSP themselves.\n\nFirst things first, this place is visited by a lot of retirees. And by a lot I'd say that we were the youngest group there by at least 50 years...and the glares to the kids in our group did not go unnoticed. But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children. \n\nSpeaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.\n\nThe restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best. \n\nThe single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits. Unfortunately, it's not always enough."
1,Great place to get sushi on this side of town. Servings of the raw fish in rolls and nigiri dishes are above average size. The flavor is amazing. The tiger roll is amazing because the spicy tuna doesn't over power  the other ingredients like most places do. Def recommended.
1,This place is the best. My wife and I always get the same. Taandori chicken garlic knaan basmati rice and mango juice and a mango lasi. Its cheap too plus udent discount
1,"A last minute trip to Arizona seemed like an opportunity to check off an item that's been on my bucket-list, namely a flight in a hot air balloon. :)  My journey started with a call to \""2FLYUS\"" who was fully booked. They referred us to Apex with whom we originally planned to fly the morning after our arrival in Phoenix. However, I ended up losing my bag with my laptop computer upon arrival at the airport and spent the wee hours of the morning trying to locate it. This caused us to be late for our appointment with APEX. They did everything they could to make our situation less stressful while at the same time taking care of their other customers who had arrived on time. They did this by calling in Rollie from Firebird Balloons. The net result was an absolutely wonderfully relaxing and gorgeous private flight over the Arizona desert with Firebird Balloons. We couldn't have been happier. They got us involved with setting up the balloon and answered many questions. The flight itself was amazing. We started out by flying high and getting a real bird's eye view of the landscape.  Then they reversed course by dropping low to catch an air current that returned us to a location near our point of departure. This was absolutely wonderful as we were able to get a close-up view of the desert while hovering comfortably just above. After the flight, we were treated to a balloonist prayer, Champaign, History of Ballooning, and great company while the balloon was stowed for the trip back to the car.  Needless to say, we have a whole lot of pictures and memories that will lift my spirits and supply me with stories for years to come. Thanks, Rollie, to you and yours for such a great time and incredibly friendly service. And notable mention to Apex and 2FlyUs who made sure we were taken care of. It was wonderful to see such cooperation amongst businesses. I would highly recommend!"
1,"As experienced Segway riders, we are always looking for something more than the usual \""introductory tour\"". We saw the 2.5-hour \""Advanced\"" tour, and signed up. Due to weather, we ended up changing days at the last minute, and Dianna was very accomodating. As it turns out, we were the only ones on that tour, so we ended up with a \""private\"" one! \n\nTremaine (sorry if I've mispelled it!), our tour guide, was AWESOME!!! After a quick test to see that we really did know how to ride, we took off. He took us all over the place, visiting neighborhoods and areas that we never would have tripped upon ourselves. He obviously has a passion for Charlotte, having grown up there, and it showed. \n\nWe got our full 2.5 hours (and then some), and think that this is probably the best tour we have taken so far on Segways. If you are an experienced rider, I would definitely recommend taking one of the advanced tours. And, ask for Tremaine!!!"
1,"My love for Bachi Burger is for reals. The OG restaurant was so banging that they opened a second location on West Sahara. Now before you think it's going to be a quick commute from the strip, it's really not that close. It's nearly nine miles from the Palazzo hotel. That's a $30 one way cab ride. Unless you don't mind a $60 to and from taxi fare, then I would suggest you come here when you have your own ride. It's situated in the Village Square shopping area right next to the Regal movie theater. It is however closer to the strip then their other location which was closer to Henderson. So if I had to choose between the two, I'd probably come here. Plus this location has a lot more working space especially for our party of 10 on this particular night.\n\nThere's no doubt about it that when I think of Bachi Burger, I fantasize about their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50. It's practically a must order and it's a great appetizer to share right out of the gates. Did I mention that is topped with a fried egg? That's how we Asians do it!\n\nAlthough the Kalbi Burger $9.5 (angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo) is my original go to, I have found a new love. The Ronin Burger $10: angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I'd like to forewarn you that it may be a little on the sweet side but like the Kalbi Burger, it is dripping with greatness. Personally, both of these burgers are neck and neck and if I had to choose between the two, I'd rather rely on a flip of a coin to determine my fate. \n\nI had their Kiki's Burger $10 on the most previous trip and although it is stacked with lots of awesome ingredients (angus beef, saut\u00e9ed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, ages gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli), it just didn't measure up to the other burgers I have mentioned. It's not bad but I probably won't order it again. The Banh-Mi Burger is probably my least favorite. I'd rather hit up Banh Mi Che Cali and get a real Vietnamese sandwich. It's a nice attempt but I'll pass.\n\nThere are a few other burgers on their menu that deserve a glance like Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. For you non beef types, they have a Crusty Crab burger, an Alaskan Cod burger, a ground chicken and turkey burger, and even a No Meat Here burger. \n\nBachi Burger is by far one of my favorite burger joints and this is coming from a guy who has cut back on consuming one of America's favorite bites. The food always seems fresh and full of rich ingredients. The acute tastes leave nothing but awesomeness on your taste buds. The great thing about the post meal is that you walk out satisfied and not overly stuffed or in a complete lethargic state of mind.\n\nUntil the next time we meet again Bachi Burger...I'll continue to miss you."
1,"I only reccommend going here after midnight because the wings are 25 cents each! \n\nYou cannot go wrong with that, but expect to wait at least 30 minutes. Yeah, it sounds like a long time, but if you're drunk enough and you can send someone to put your name on the list, it is definitely worth it."
1,"Love this place. Well worth the drive to the west side. I've eaten here about four times,  only for dinner. I've had their veggie samosas, chicken tikka masala, chana masala, chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, mango lassi, and naan. I've dined-in three times and was seated pretty quickly however, one night I came to pick up my to-go order on a Friday evening and waited about 30 min (which was in addition to the time they told it would be ready). At any rate, it's delicious food and is an establishment I will continue to frequent."
0,"I took my two dogs in 3 days ago for grooming. To begin with, the people working back there didn't seem to know what was going on or what they were doing. I saw one younger male employee grooming a very small dog and when the dog shifted to the side, the guy said \""Stop it\"" in a very loud voice and roughly shifted the dog back the way he/she was. I was a little freaked out by that but the rest of the girls seemed ok; not great but ok. When I went and picked my dogs up, I was not happy. Both of my dogs have burns on their skin from the clipper along with several other cuts in various places and I'm going to have to take them into the vet to have those treated. My male has a long cut from underneath his eye almost to the bridge of his nose that's going to have to be treated as well. When I went into pick them up, this really snotty girl handed me a receipt and told me to go pay at the register and they would bring the dogs out. I went and paid and then proceeded to stand there for 20 minutes waiting for my dogs.  Both of my dogs have been scared and shaking ever since I picked them up. I'm not sure if they tranquilized them or not. The girl said they don't but I'm not sure. All I know is my dogs have been scared ever since they came out of that place and I have a feeling the groomers were not very nice to them. My dogs are not naturally scared and they're very friendly/sweet.  I am NOT happy with Petsmart at all and would NEVER, EVER take my dogs back there again nor would I recommend them to anyone. In fact, I'm considering filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Do NOT take your dogs here; you will be sorry. The people working in there are kids and they are obviously not trained. They need to hire some competent groomers who genuinely care for animals and know how to treat them."
1,I had a maple cronut plus a scoop of eis cream...absolutely wonderful!\n\nEveryone should give this beautiful place a try.
1,"Great sandwiches. Toasty, tasty, oowie gooie goodness."
0,"The only thing this Von's has going for it is that it was on my way back from grubbin' at In-N-Out across the street.  I've never had to pass through a turn-style to get into a grocery store - what exactly is that about? I understand the neighborhood is a bit on the sketchy side, but I've also never seen an entire aisle locked with gates - you need to have an employee unlock the gate if you need anything in the personal care aisle.  Maybe this shouldn't be held against the store in general, but it gives me a weird vibe.  \n\nWhile I was checking out, the cashier initiated a conversation about the economy and recession, making comments that not everybody can afford groceries anymore and how her personal financial troubles caused her home to lose value, etc.  She seemed very angry.  While I can definitely sympathize, it made me totally uncomfortable."
0,"Ouch, this place has gone downhill like the rest of The Venetian. Came here years ago and this place was NICE! Now it feels neglected. \n\n1) They use to have bottled water. Now it's a dirty drinking fountain with a clogged filter. Water comes out at a very very slow trickle. Makes you wonder if they ever changed the filter.\n2) AC turned way too low. I was sweating to death in the joint\n3) Bathroom was not property maintained\n\nThis place is ruining the Canyon Ranch name."
1,"I know that even within my own corporate halls there are discussions over New York vs Chicago pizza and who has the best...All I've ever really known is New York style. [We've shipped in Chicago and its a bomber - loaded with cheese and meat and a total heart stopper. ] So now that you know my dirty little secret, this is good pizza. Not woohoo over the top, but its good. Sorry, but no self-respecting NY pizza would have either the deep dish-ish sensibility or the crispy crust thing. \n\nWe frequently take the kids [aged 19 -7] and its a hit. I'm not a wings person but all reports are that the one flavor - buffalo - are good. Its clean, service is right on and pleasant. Totally can't complain."
0,"On Sunday night, it was around 8 when I decided that I didn't feel like cooking dinner, so we hopped in the car and decided to head over to Red Bowl for a quick bite. Despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy, our service was rather sub-par. Also, I was not happy when I ordered my dinner with brown rice (as I always do) and was told that there is now a $1 up-charge for brown rice. WTH? \n\nIncidentally, I have some good friends who used to frequent this place who are now boycotting it because Red Bowl has started cheaping-out on everything including their sushi specials.  They are definitely losing some of their loyal customers with some of the changes they have been making. \n\nBefore this, Red Bowl was never my favorite spot, but it was cheap & quick.  The quality was always hit-or-miss, and on this visit, the food was so-so.  My flower chicken was ok (bland but not gross), the brown rice was meh, and the chicken egg roll was downright gross (it tasted like a frozen egg-roll that was not very fresh or warm). Based on the food & service on this visit, next time I am looking for a quick bite of Asian food close by, I will head over to Jo-Jo at Stone Crest instead of this place."
1,"I work next door at the Wynn/Encore, so Im at this place often. A top 5 place in town hands down...maybe higher for Mexican food. Believe the hype and visit this place. They are famous for their adobada ( spicy pork....not very spicy), but its delish nonetheless. Their adobada or carne asada fries are great an their tacos are authentic. \n\nPlace gets very busy and dirty. So dont expect your meal to be perfect. Sometimes your tacos will be thrown together too fast and be below what they might be on other visits."
0,"When I saw this place while walking between Palazzo and Venetian, it looked good. So I decided to try it on the day we leave on Sat 5/25. I bought two denishes and a slice of carrot cake. They were aweful. Basically they were not made the day. I don't know how long they have been on display, but the denises are hard and the carrot cake has a taste of fat which has been few days after they were made. I don't this this place belongs to Palazzo."
1,"A diamond in the rough!  Mesa is not exactly an ethnic restaurant hot spot.  It is really hard to find anything decent, so when I heard about Benjarong, I went with high hopes.  It is hidden in a plaza, and I like to go during lunch since they always have specials.  They serve soup and a wonton and a spring roll first.  Then, your entree quickly follows.  The portions are perfect.  I always east it all without feeling too stuffed.  The servers are always friendly."
1,"Like many Smith's this is an upbeat and clean supermarket with a vast selection. This supermarket has been here for ages, and it does not show it. Overall it is a nice shopping experience."
1,Excellent coffee.  Good atmosphere; not great but good.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  Free WiFi which makes getting word done easy.
0,We ordered this food for our work. All of the food tasted sickly. As in as you eat it you feel yourself getting sick. Nobody could finish the food and we all threw it away. Two of my coworkers are already in the bathroom. Very gross food.
1,Salmon dinner with spinach and mash potatoes are to die for...Salmon is so juicy! I cant bring myself to venture away from it
1,"This is a very small restaurant (about six tables tops) behind McDonald's in a strip mall on the corner of Sahara and Rancho. Bento style combination lunch & dinner but there are specialties like maui noodles (vermicelli). I usually get the teriyaki chicken or the teriyaki salmon- comes with miso soup, a scoop of rice, salad, a couple pieces tempura, and a potsticker. Most dishes under $10.00 per person. It's pretty good for a hole in the wall with a huge menu and is in a convenient location. The food is prepared quickly. We haven't had anything bad here. Rarely busy whenever we go, but I think it holds up because there is a pretty loyal following. The canned Hawaiian drinks like Pass-O-Guava, available. My only complaint: Closed on sundays. We found that out the hard way- and we really wanted a bento special too. PS.) I went to the other location but just thought that it was ok. Yup, this one's better- guess this is why it's the last one standing."
0,"So I ordered the Nathan sliders as an appetizer. The menu specifically states that you get 6 mini hotdogs with your choice of topping. It lists cheese, relish, mustard and a few other things. I asked our server if it was nacho cheese or shredded cheese. She said either or. As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it, it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star. After all that I go to pay and she asks me how everything was....... \""Actually it wasn't even that good\"" was my answer. So more importantly don't eat here because the food is basically terrible."
0,"Do not stay here unless you want blood on your sheets PRIOR to checking in. UNACCEPTABLE. WILL NOT PAY THIS MUCH FOR A \""6 star hotel.\"""
1,It's been a few months since I've been here last but both times I couldn't help but order the shrimp and grits - LOVE. I don't think I could pull myself away to try any other entree. I've also had the tomato soup- very unique with the curry cream. Love the decor as well. This is a must try!
0,"Tonight we had a family gathering and went to Arriba because an Easterner was in town and wanted Mexican. What a huge disappointment! The food is insanely hot - even though we ordered \""mild\"" dishes and the fish is nasty nasty nasty! We Arizonans are used to good fish tacos - and they exist up the road at Senor Tacos, but not here. Sorry, I can't understand how, in an area with a dozen really great Mexican places, how this gets by at all. Come to think of it, it wasn't busy at all so maybe the word is out! There are way too many great Mexican, non-chain places around to come here and waste your time and money. Oh, and there was no offer from management to to make the terrible food right, either!"
1,"We go on school nights, and the entire staff is always so very happy!!  I am totally impressed with their positive attitudes and great deal of patients with the children and parents!!  ;o) no matter how busy they are, they are still smiling!!  Thank you!!"
0,"Expensive Gringo Mexican food.  Saving grace is the setting.  Wonderful pond with ducks in the middle of the facility.  Go for the beauty of it, not for the \""Mexican\"" food.  They seem to cater to the Cave Creek tourist \""semi cowboy\"" trade."
0,"The cupcakes are OKAY, but nothing memorable or different.  I have been a few times and tried almost all of them, none stood out."
1,"the lobster cheese fries were so delish! the drinks were good, the prices were just fine, and the burger was too juicy to pick up. knife and fork it, baby!"
1,"Food is great, a little too loud for me, gorgeous inside, service is good, price is on the expensive side, but well worth it.... love it will definitely go there again, favorite sushi roll is capo blanco roll!!!!"
0,"We've been to CJ's many time but the one reason to come here is for their Motherlode Chocolate cake. Anyways, we decided to come here again. \n\nWe had to wait a good 30 minutes for our table. Our hostess finally called our name and brought us in the middle of the dining room and just left us there because she forgot what table. We stood there for a good minute waiting. Can you say awkward. Finally got our table and our server was pretty prompt in taking care of us. \n\nWe didn't order any appetizers cause we know the portions are huge. I ordered the chicken fried steak. Like I said it was huge but the only problem is that there wasn't enough gravy. Little dry and lots of breading. I wasn't too impressed. My wife had the fish and chips. The fish was pretty good. Crispy and tender. My son had a salad with his dinner but the salad looked really limp. So overall, the food was very disappointing. To top it off, we were so full and unimpressed that we didn't even order the Motherlode Chocolate cake. Now that's disappointing. \n\nI would have to say the service was pretty good but the food is what made our experience disappointing. We'll have to see if we come back or not."
0,"I called my doctor for a refill and they said call the pharmacy. I called the pharmacy and faxed it over to my doctors. I called the doctors and they said they didn't get it. I called the pharmacy and they faxed it with me there. I call the doctor...well you get it. Finally they said it takes 72 hours. Really!? And they couldn't even tell me if it could be called in for a refill so I asked so do I just make an appointment to make sure and they couldn't tell me. I'm not the professional here, I need some assistance from you and the next appointment was so far out I couldn't believe it."
0,"Yes, its a beautiful, architectually designed hotel that is so over the top that you have to use a damn remote control to close the curtains.\nThe SIMPLE things and ammenties do not exisit! I stayed in the Sky Suite. The room itself was clean, the bed was very comfy, but when it came to just basic stuff, it just pissed me off. I wanted to listen to music on an ipod or a radio. Not happening, you have to press 20 buttons on the remote and still no chance you will get what you want. They wanted to make it \""green\"" apparently, but I wasn't diggin on it.  \n\n I ate at a Cafe there, don't remember the name, but the service was excellent, food was cooked to perfection and yes it was pricey but expected. \n\nDefinitly get your car valet parked.\n\nThe entrance and getting to your room is NOT convenient at all. You have to walk 6-7 minutes just from the strip to get to the entrance of the hotel, then another 10 minutes walking thru the casino with your suitcase and crap to get to your room which the elevators are located in the back! It sucks!! Of course, they have it laid out that way on purpose, to get you suckered in to throwing some $ down on the slots, etc. But , its a pain in the ass to haul everything, especially on your last day, when all you want is OUT of there."
1,"Totally enjoyed my birthday dinner at Inca's on Thursday. Fatima was charming and our waiter was very attentive, even if he moved like the Energizer bunny! Food was delicious - the PISCO PORTON (very yummy!), the CEVICHE MIXTO and the Shrimp bisque soup (CHUPO DE CAMRONES) were all perfect. So were all the other dinners. Have to go back. Prices no worse than other moderate-upscale places in the area. Nice change of pace! Hope they stick around. Nice atmosphere too."
0,"if there was a negative star on here I would give it. This is the worst department store I have ever been in. Disorganized, a total mess, staff is anything but helpful.  Avoid this store at all costs."
1,"I met some friends who were already here and I must say ALL of us were impressed. Right as I got there they were ordering food, which was Sheppard's Pie, Irish Nachos, and Sticky Toffee Pudding! All of it was DELICIOUS!!! The staff was Great and we all determined we will be coming back! \n\nI also like the fact, if you didn't want to sit at the bar or by the bar they had a separate eating area too. More cozy and quite if you can believe for a bar. \n\nP.S.-We had a second helping of sticky toffee pudding! Mmm Mmm Good"
1,"You can't hate on a place that opens 24 hours in Vegas because you never know when you'll be getting in. If you stay in Planet Hollywood, it's even better because you can order a sandwich to go if you're in a rush to get ready or even have a late night snack after going out to cure your drunk munchies. They have sandwiches and soups. I'm soooooo thankful for the soup because that's all I crave when I am hungover!"
1,"If you're in town with buddies and the gals are at home, this is the place to go.   Rooms weren't bad, they weren't big, but seriously now, you're not there to sleep, you're there to gamble.  Food at the 24/7 place wasn't bad at all, for the $ it's a a good deal.  Comps are fantastic, get a card, you'll get a free room, eventually.  People were nice, we were chatting with a guy dragged into dinner with his wife, while waiting in line, not the sleezy feeling you get on the strip.  \n\nDidn't see a roach problem, looks like that was taken care of, having worked as a health inspector yrs ago, someone would have caught that and fixed it.  One place to avoid (just because the food isn't that great) is the place right near the exit where you go out to Fremont.\n\nWill stay there again when I can, worth the time, promised the missus I'd take her to the strip next time so it'll be a while with the guys,"
1,"Felt compelled to write a quick review after having a phenomenal burrito here today. I've been going here for about three years and had some fine meals, but today was over the top. \n\nI usually get the regular size, but this time went for the big, along with the spicy chicken in green chile sauce. Since I was in a hurry, I just told them to load it with \""everything\"". That included, rice, black beans, three kinds of salsa, cilantro, onions, sour cream, guac, chopped jalapenos, lettuce, and tomato - it was monstrously large! Still not sure how they wrapped it but they did. \n\nThe taste was perfect - spicy, smooth, crunchy, warm. A lot of different flavors that together were a symphony in my mouth! Utterly and totally hit the spot. Added bonus - local place with local owners just putting out great product. \n\nThumbs up Johnny B's!"
0,"Went at 6:30pm, on a Thursday night (tonight), food was cold and old looking. I special ordered a pound of crab legs, they were ice cold inside in parts. The only thing I ate that was hot was what I had the lady cook for me on the grill. If you other folks think this is a 4 and 5 star place, either you do not get out much or your other local choices suck worse than this place. Maybe this place is better on the weekend when they actually have customers and the food turns over more frequently and is fresher. But I will never be back to find out."
1,"Thanks, fellow Yelpers, for the stellar reviews of Brandon, the wonder groomer. My cat Charlotte has out-of-control fur that needs at least semi-annual shaving, and I was not happy with the last groomer who made her face uneven and lopped off half of her whiskers. I told Brandon what Charlotte liked (the lion poof tail) and what annoyed her (the leg fur they left long) and he groomed her exactly to my specifications. He even clipped her nails, gave her a bath, and cleaned out her ears. Charlotte disliked the bath, but was otherwise putty in Brandon's gentle hands. \n\nIt became very clear that he is a true animal lover as we exchanged animal rescue stories. He also volunteers his talents at the Humane Society so that the scraggly ones look more presentable for adoption and has fostered for a local no-kill shelter. He has over 20 years experience as a groomer. I couldn't believe that after 1.25 hours of work on Charlotte, he only charged $45.\n\nA Doggie in the Window is unpretentious, as others have said, but clean and comfortable. One thing I noticed were all the potted plants- including some beautiful orchids. It makes sense that someone who can keep an orchid thriving would also be such a highly regarded, loving, attentive groomer."
0,"Great name . Average food.  Actually, come to think of it the Tortilla soup was quite good. The cheese enchiladas... not so much. \n\nService was pretty good. And there is a nice patio. Music was awful."
0,This McD's service sucks. I have been here numerous times and have had some sort of bad service every single time.
1,"Glad to have a Mexican place in the hood! Came here on an early dinner date and had a nice time. The service was prompt and friendly, the space was simply and tastefully decorated. We arrived around 5:30 and the place was empty but it started to fill up with customers as we were eating. We started with the guacamole and chips and it was a small-ish portion to share (which I actually appreciated, I didn't want to spoil my appetite). Guac was really tasty. I had the pork tacos (can't remember what they're called on the menu now) and they were good. My boyfriend had the mole poblano chicken and he loved the sauce but said the chicken was disappointingly dry. Overall it was pleasant. Not mindblowing but I'll probably be back next time I'm craving Mexican!"
1,"Saturday night we had a lovely dinner. The food was delicious and timed perfectly. The servers were gracious and knowledgeable and not intrusive. The view was spectacular with the clouds sitting and sun shining behind them. It made for a perfect quiet evening!! Of course, we will be back."
1,"My first time visit as recommended by my friend, who is a regular. I had the Tavern burger..and it was delicious...cooked to perfection. I also had the sweet potatoes tots.\nOMG they were fantastic so sweet  and tasty (my first time). I drank my cos-mo and enjoyed the lively atmosphere. I  positively will go again and bring some new friends with me.\nEven though the place was jam packed on Saturday night the service was top notch.\nWe sat outside on the patio because it was a nice cool night which is a rare thing in August."
0,"Underwhelmed by our dining experience at Searsucker...there are so many better chef-driven restaurants in Scottsdale. Very trendy decor, but the dining experience just does not delivery. Chef Malarkey roamed the dining room promoting the Taste, but he would have better served his restaurant had he spent the evening in the kitchen.  The entire dining experience was rushed -- we were in and out for dinner in little more than and hour.  The eggs and bacon small plate was cold, which was sad because the flavors were promising. The chicken and waffles and franks small plate was also cold.  The filet was underwhelming.  The short rib small plate was redeeming. The duck fat fries were greasy and, again, cold. The brussel sprouts were, well, burnt, (not caramelized) and doused in vinegar.  It is disappointing that a meal that was so rushed, was served cold. The server was also not interested in our comments about dinner, disappointed we opted not to order dessert.  We will choose to dine elsewhere and skip the hype of Searsucker."
0,"Really mediocre bland pizza.  Overly thick crust for wood-fired.  Every ingredient, from crust to cheese to toppings to sauce was lackluster and flavorless. On plus side it is clean and decorated in an inoffensive modern manner.  Recommend against. Go to Pomo nearby instead."
1,"My LCD shorted out last night, making my iPhone useless.  It is a corporate phone that is out of warranty, so I was worried I would have to travel on Monday without a phone.  Found these guys here on Yelp, took the phone it, and the LCD was fixed in 35 minutes.  Total cost?  Only $60.  Wow.  The owner is as nice as they get, and knows how to fix just about any device.  HIGHLY recommended!"
1,Good fast healthy option.
0,They no longer offer discount to players card members and the quality of food has decreased substantially. We have never stayed at the Palms hotel but it has been somewhat of a tradition that regardless of where we were staying on the strip we would make at least one drive over to the Palms for the buffet and some gambling afterwards. I wasn't so much disappointed with the increased cost aspect of it as I was with the apparent degrade in quality. I especially missed the kalbi beef ribs and the sesame wings.. If anyone reading this has any suggestions for other off strip buffets please feel free to share!
0,"We had a small group go in for snacks and drinks after visiting the 13th Floor haunted house on the other side of the mall. We got a table on the patio and when we ordered with our waitress, she wanted a credit card or for us to pay as we go. Now maybe this place has some sort of problem with people walking out on them, but if thats the case its probably because of staff like her. When I questioned her about it she tried to give us some half hearted sob story about why it needed to be done. I guess at this point realizing I was pretty irritated and wasn't going to do either of the options she had given me, she offered up another server which we gladly accepted. The next waitress was much more pleasant and friendly and [shockingly!] didn't require a credit card deposit or to pay as we go. \nOverall it was a pretty bad first impression, but by the end of the night I was satisfied. The fried zucchini was pretty good, I wasn't too impressed with the fries or the garlic bread that we got though. The beer was nice and cold!"
1,"Ok, we admit it... we have a ridiculous foodie crush on Chef Bobby Flay!  We have been to almost every restaurant he has, including completing the Trifecta of Mesa Grills... New York, VEGAS (at Caesar's Palace across from Pure) and the Bahamas (at the Cove, at the Atlantis in Paradise Island).  Mesa offers lunch and dinner, as well as brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. The food is spicy, inventive and ExCeLLeNT!\n\nFor dinner, start off with the Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck and the Sophie's Chopped Salad (with chick peas, olives and tortillas).  Famous for southwestern cuisine and grilling, be ready for some spicy meat!  The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with a Sweet Potato Tamale and Crushed Pecan Butter.... damn! The Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with Red Chile, Lime and Rosemary, with Green Corn Pudding.... whew... sexy!  Blue Corn Soft Shell Crabs with Bacon, Green Onion and Chile Vinegar... I could go on and on.\n\nIf you can make it for brunch... please do!  I think it may be better than dinner.  First off, a ridiculously amazing bread basket- my favorite is the spicy, corn muffins with pieces of corn in it and swirls of spice.  For your entree, definitely have the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs and Green Chile Hollandaise.  I can not even explain how good this is.  Sort of like a spicy Eggs Benedict with chicken and sweet potato homefries.  Some one always orders the Eggs and Aged Sirloin Tortilla with Roasted Peppers and Avocado Relish... and loves it!  It is simple, but delish... think make your own tacos with steak and eggs.\n\nNo matter what meal you eat, the tequila cocktails are the perfect accompaniment.    Hands down, the Cactus Pear Margarita wins it!  Watch out boys... its pink!\n\nThe Scene- Always full... full of Foodies!  Lively!  \n\nFood and Drinks- 5: Mind Blowing and Life Changing.  \n\nTip Worthy- 5: The New Yorker 25-30%.  Excellent service... 3 to 4 servers at a time... one water, one bread, busy boy and waiter... without being the LEAST BIT stuffy.\n\nCoordinates- 4: Neighborhood- Centrally located! \n\nRestaurant Return Rate- Green light!  Between the three Mesa's, we have had at least 10 meals.  We bring everyone we know when there is one close by.  \n\nThis review written by Angela."
1,"Yves Rocher, c'est une boutique que je suis depuis ma plus tendre adolescence en France. Aussi quelle ne f\u00fbt pas ma joie de la d\u00e9couvrir ici au Canada!

En plus quand on est membre (ce qui ne co\u00fbte rien), on re\u00e7oit environ 3 cartes de promotions tous les mois : g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement 50% sur tout le magasin ou alors des 2 pour 1.

1,"I actually thought this place was pretty good. The wings reminded me of Native New Yorker wings back home in AZ. \nWe ordered the full order of hot wings for $15. Our waitress was sweet and our order came pretty quickly. We ordered half hot and half atomic hot. We couldn't tell the difference, both were good and hot, just like we like. For some reason though my beers seemed to take a while to get to me, which i didn't like. I think she simply kept forgetting about them. The place had a a big bar area with a small stage for music entertainment during the evening weekend hours I'm assuming, since nothing was goin on while we were there. Lots of Tv's which pleased my son and I as we like to watch football while enjoying yummy wings. \nIf I'm ever in the epicenter in Charlotte again I wouldn't mind stopping there again."
0,I remember this place as Narita... And that was a good place.  Arata not so much. All I can say is I'm so sorry I stopped by here. The food was mediocre. I ordered a roll and chicken teriyaki. I know what chicken teriyaki is and what it tastes like. This was not chicken teriyaki. It was some kind of oil drenched fried chicken and I'm not sure if the pan that they used had been cleaned or if it was their version of chicken teriyaki but all I could taste was grease and garlic. I ended up eating the salad and leaving. I hope I don't get sick!
1,Monti's has one of the best steak dinners in town. The service is always excellent and we love the atmosphere there. Plus an open patio facing Tempe Beach Park. \n\nTheir historic building is awesome. A true Mill landmark.
1,"FuNuGyz is my new go-to spot for lunch in the west valley.  The burgers are excellent, but my favorites are just about anything that comes out of the deep-fryer.  They have awesome homemade fried mozzarella - you must try it!  Service is generally good and the beer is cold.  What more could you want?"
1,The best coffee I've ever had.  Time to stock up again.
1,"There's something about me that when I like a place a lot, I have to take a piece of it with me. And I don't mean some sort of silly metaphor in that I'm going to walk away with the memories of the time spent. That's too easy and to This American Life-ish.\n\nNo, there's no Ira Glass in this review. I'm talking about simply taking something. Yes, it may be a bit of a klepto move, but in this case I took a menu. A full menu from here. I just put it in an New Times (Holy fuck, they still print this places?!) and when I left, it came with me. So if you noticed a missing menu, Lost Leaf, you know where it is now. Tough shit, you're not getting it back!\n\nNow you would think this is just strange behavior. That I have some sort of problem. It's not typically anything of real value. Some flier for the place, a business card perhaps or maybe even a beer coaster. These are things that would normally get thrown out by the staff if I left it behind on the table when I left anyway. So it's not that harmful, right? \n\nIn this instance it's because this place has such a vast and impressive beer selection ranging from all over this brownish sandy red land (it is the desert after all) that I just had to take something to prove that their beer menu actually existed. That I wasn't just making it up because I spent a full 7 hours on the road and then another 7 more driving back in the course of one day. Take it as a compliment and send me a bill for the paper you printed it on, if you are so inclined. \n\nThe setting is very dimly lite. Let me back track here for a second. This place was really hard to find. I mean, really hard to find. I'm not sure why Arizona has found it necessary to have one ascending order of numbers on the East side of town and when you count down to 0 in terms of streets it becomes Central and then starts the numbering system again. So you can pass 7th street and then a couple blocks later pass 7th again. \n\nI was driving down 5th st. endlessly looking for this very normal looking house that is a bar. Little did I know it was ten blocks over on 5th place or whatever the hell they were calling the street. Arizona, shape up here. When you come up to this joint you're going to be confused. It looks like a normal house. \n\nIn fact I was curious to see if we had to use a door bell. But once inside in this dimly lit amazing lounge you pull up a chair and look at this huge list of beer that you can choose from. Beer from Arizona, from California, form New Mexico. Bottles of microbrews that I was really just in heaven from looking at this list alone.\n\nThen when they pulled the cold beers in the fridge I finally realized it wasn't just a dream. Who would have thought? A-freaking'-mazin! The lounge had some DJ space or room for a small band to just play there. It was something else entirely. A mix of your friend's cool place with a well stocked fridge. \n\nThey had a beach cruiser bike sitting in the place for sale, which might I add, where the fuck is a beach near here? Yeah. Exactly. That's what I thought! But still, it just goes to show you that this place has its roots in this community and is all about just making it the local chill place. Get a beer or two, sit in the lounge. Steal a menu.. These are all things that I came to love about it. \n\nOh yeah, and the local artist's art hanging on the wall for sale is also a way to give back to the community of local artist.. I guess. I'm sure they owe more in a bar tab than the painting can make.. I'm sure of it. Hmm, maybe I should jump back on my art to make extra beer money.\n\nWhat an awesome place to relax with a cold one. The beer alone makes this a destination spot if you're ever in Arizona. And if they haven't banned me for stealing a menu, I will definitely go back again! \n\nI guess the lesson to be learned from all this is that in a city that monitors your speed on the highway with cameras, is known for having a tent city prison that makes inmates wear pink leads to people finding an urge to lash out at authority. Why else would it be legal to carry a firearm in this state. You really can't be surprised that someone like myself would steal a copy of your menu. \n\nGiven the chance.. I would do it again and I want to return to the scene of the crime again and again."
1,1St Indian food experience was a pleasant one.   Great value in the buffet and staff was great.
0,Knowledgeable. Plays on your intelligence - you need to have good idea what your items are worth or what you are willing to consider a fair deal . Must ask direct question to get answer as he answers question with question.
1,"Creation is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. There are lots of things that are great, from the decor to the prices to the service...it's one of the places I come back to again and again, and I like to bring friends who are visiting from out of town here.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is the cabbage wraps with tofu. It's too much, which means I can bring some home. The half-price bottles of wine on Sundays are (obviously) an awesome asset as well. \n\nIt's a minimalist, warehouse kind of feeling inside. I love the big windows, the clean spaces, and the muted colors. The bar is nice as well, and it makes for a great escape from the Penguin's weekend frenzy if you want to be able to breathe and hear the folks you are with talking."
0,"For my birthday i decided to get my industrial piercing in my left ear. So i went to the shop and they quoted me a price that was a little expensive but i was excited so i got it anyways. During the piercing, i passed out (no idea why). The piercing wasn't painful or anything. Also note that the passing out had nothing to do with the shop. But anyways after we finished, i was a little light headed so i asked to sit down an 3 minutes later he said they were closing and i had to leave. Mind you that this was 5pm on a Friday. They close at like 2am. I was being generous and gave them two stars because the piercing came out fine."
0,"Open letter to the management:\n\nThere is something you seem not to know about your wait staff, they try to take advantage of your customers by rounded down the change on a ticket. Let's say a ticket totaled $17.31, and I gave her a $20 and a $10, what should I have gotten in change? Why any 3rd grader will tell you $12.69 (broken into 1's and a $5). What I got was $12.00 even, shorting me you $0.69. Is this a big deal? Not once it's not but after having this behavior happen at your establishment several times it has become a habit with your staff, assuming the change. To compound this, this particular waitress I had called this on her before. I had also informed management before and so obviously nothing had been done. Did I get pissed off, yeah... I certainly did (and admittedly a bit over the top). Did a manager both to ask why I was so upset... no. \n\nOK... so I'm 86'ed from your little place... plenty of places to eat in Vegas, but you should know that your staff is not as honest with your customers as you would like to think and your rep on the street is reflecting of this. I had been warned (by a former employee of yours) that this was the \""inside baseball\"" thing that happened there but I couldn't believe it. Obviously it was true. The shame of it all is unfortunately this sort of behavior has spread to other places, and I would assume it is the economy that spurs this on.\n\nThe funny thing is, when a server brings me my change rounded the other way (so maybe I get a few cents extra back), I usually am sure to tip it back and then some, and people who know me know I am not a cheap tipper. (Unless you assume the change and then I am likely to leave nothing at all, seeing as how you've taken your tip already.)\n\nSo yeah, 86 me, but be sure to fire your wait staff, they are doing you a great disservice. And now you know what gets gossiped about your establishment, a rare thing for management to learn, and I'd use it if I were you.\n\n-JB\nNeed to contact me: yelp@visual-impact.com"
0,"This review is not about the food. We didn't get to eat any of it. It's about the service, or lack thereof. When we walked in they said \""It's a 20 minute wait, but you can have a drink and sit outside. We'll call out your name.\"" A while later they claimed they had called our names even though we were practically right next to the host stand. When my friend complained about that the hostess basically shushed her. Then we were completely ignored by the wait staff when we finally were sat down. No one stopped by to even say \""I'll be with you in a moment.\""  We finally said \""Forget it\"" and took our business elsewhere."
1,"Having grown up in N.C. I'm a big fan of BBQ. Mainly pork sandwiches. I drove by this place twice and even heard about it through the grapevine. Overall, I would give it a B. I'm not comparing NC BBQ to Vegas BBQ, but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. I should have noticed the word \""pulled\"" pork as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork. The pork itself was smoky and tender. Long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll. I added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake. The coleslaw (ugh) had chucky bits of cabbage stalk, jalapenos, carrots, corn and I swear I saw bacon in the mix. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't salty; It added nothing to the meal. The mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious. Oddly enough, it tasted like potatoes au gratin I just bought from the store. \n\nAside from that awful coleslaw experience I would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are a bit high and I wish tried something that was just amazing! I will have to go back when they aren't charging full prices such as after 5pm. Perhaps, the ribs and brisket are better."
0,It's close to 3am and you just got in from a night of excess Vegas style. You're hungry and all the neon lights are killing your eyes. All you want is a slice of pizza and the comfort of your bed....\n\nI wouldn't say Sirrico's to the rescue but it will do as the scene above plays out on your Saturday night in Sin City.\n\nTalking to the others in line and watching the passer-bys is better than their pie but what are ya gonna do?!?!?!
1,"Great beer on tap selection.  Stopped there for lunch recently and had a salad that will bring me back there again soon.  Many, many TVs in the bar area, so this would be a great place to watch a sporting event."
0,"If you like bad service and just OK sushi, then come here. If you don't take my word for it, the empty seats when you walk in \""should\"" be the tall tale sign not to come here.\n\nWe came to this place because all other all-you-can eat sushi joints in the area were  at least 1-2 hour wait(new years weekend). This place had NO wait (I wonder why?).\n\nEach time we ordered something (remember all you can eat) the waitress would ask, \""are you sure??\"". They also had that disgusted look when we ordered. We did not feel welcome at all.\n\nTrust me on this review...\n\nFYI: the food was ok...nothing special. To be honest, all the rolls tastes exactly the same."
1,Great place to hang out. The staff really cares about their patrons. Good food and talented bartenders.
0,"This place was below average. Artichoke dip was ok, calamari was horrible. If you go wrong with calamari, then the restaurant has issues. It was pretty much just batter and no squid. My meatloaf was salty and edible but that's about it. The ravioli was under cook and bad. In general, everything including my mash potatoes was salty. My friend couldn't finish his meatloaf and left to eat Chinese food at the Venetian. Service was fine though but we left disappointed the plates averaged 20 bucks aside for steak items."
1,"My wife took me here a while back, and I always wait for the day I can make it back over there. Very delicious, enjoyed the shaved ice they have!"
0,"The food is excellent.  Plenty of options from big burgers to salads and everything in between.  The two female bartenders are attentive, nice, and bust their humps to make sure everyone in their service is happy.  However, I have never had good service anywhere but at the bar.  Not once.  The wait-either to get a table or to receive our food-is always something along the lines of the entire cretaceous period.\n\n What is boils down to is that if you can get seated and get your food delivered hot, this place is great.  That can be a real challenge though.  The kitchen is undersized for the volume that comes through so the hostesses, servers, and all the other front line staff are constantly overwhelmed.  The hostesses are generally kind of clueless as well, which does not help.  Friends have managed to seat themselves in the midst of a \""two hour+ wait\"" by simply plopping down at an empty table more than once.  \n\nIf you are eating here it is probably because you are visiting the WWC, so all I can say is plan your food consumption during your visit to avoid peak times and you will probably have a solid, three star dining experience at a reasonable price point.  Come during the rush and prepare to be miserable.\n\nOne last thing.  The beers on tap are always very well thought out and tasty.  They usually have local microbrews in addition to good ole standbys like Bells Two Hearted and Fat Tire as well as a very healthy selection of bottled beers.  The prices are pretty normal for a bar and the selection cant be beaten, short of places like the Pizza Peel and the Flying Saucer.  Probably this places biggest redeeming quality."
0,"Very disappointed in the two girls working here tonight. Most of the toppings were put away by the time we got there @ 9:40 pm. Plain frozen yogurt tonight for the kids. They did not offer any samples and we had to eat in the car since the chairs were already put away. Drive a little farther and go to either Razzleberriez (awesome service and open until 11 pm), or the Yogurtology in Arrowhead."
1,"This Karve Studio is really welcoming and the energy is great! I'm glad a close friend convinced me to buy this Groupon with him, because I finally got to try a Karve Studio out!\n\nMy friend and I tried our first class here last Saturday and really enjoyed our time here. He's done the Dailey Method before. I've done The Bar Method and Pure Barre and I really enjoyed this one. The instructors told me that Karve is more similar to Bar Method, and I agree, but this was the perfect mix because although I was pushed and encouraged to have great form and work hard, I didn't feel like a drill sergeant was yelling at me. Michelle was a great motivator and made the class fun!\n\nWith a previous history of ballet, it is fun to be back in a class where I can use the bar again and whip muscles back into shape that I forgot I had. I'm not one to work on flexibility myself, so it takes classes like these and yoga to help gain more flexibility and motivate me. \n\nI was told I wouldn't sweat much, but I did! Even though just the tiniest movements are made, pulsing at the point where your muscles begin to shake can be really tough work and tiring. You know you're getting results though. You feel it. You feel your core getting stronger and you feel your muscles working to the point of exhaustion. Like another reviewer said, it's super addicting, because you love the way you feel at the end and are all smiles when walking out."
1,"I didn't even know that Aria had opened.\n\nI wish I had.  I want to stay here now.\n\nThis place is BEAUTIFUL!  The BF and I decided to take a random walk down the Strip, and somehow or another, we ended up at City Center.\n\nCity Center itself takes a little getting used to, as the layout combines a mall, two hotels, and a gallery or something.  Whatever the case, I wasn't really sure where we were at, but after maneuvering through a near-empty designer mall (empty but GORGEOUS!), we somehow ended up outside the doors of Aria.\n\nWe walked in and...\n\nOoooooooh.\n\nThe best way to describe the lobby+casino, in my opinion, is that it looks like a really tranquil spa.  Tall trees reach up to the ceilings, everything is furnished in ivories and deep browns, the lighting is dim and moody, and strangely, the casino is sort of... peaceful.\n\nMost importantly, everything somehow looked CLEAN.  It wasn't bright and glitzy like most other showy Vegas hotels; rather, Aria felt more Zen.\n\nWe exited the casino through a different set of doors, and I guess this area was the main entrance.  There was a beautiful wall fountain with cascading waterfalls (SO PRETTY), a cool light show thingie going on with the awning, and a small but dope fountain with lights that made each jet stream look like fireworks.\n\nSummation?  The outside looked like some awards show venue.  The inside looked like the poshest spa ever.\n\nAnd after scoping out the website, I'm determined that my next Vegas trip will include a stay at Aria.  I need to check out these rooms, especially while prices are relatively reasonable."
1,"This is my go to thai place downtown. I work just down the street so it's convenient. The pricing is right, and I like their thai iced tea. The service is always attentive and nice. You get a free spring roll and a soup or salad with your lunch order. I order beef pad thai and thai iced tea and generally walk out paying about 13 dollars. \n\nTry it!"
1,Did 3 hours of paintball with a 13 person bachelor party.  Staff was great and the games were wild.  The courses are small so be ready to get hit.  Would go again.
0,"I tried Mother's for the first time eventhough my go to spot in Vegas is Korean Garden BBQ House.  \nI don't think I've ever paid so much for one plate of kalbi before ($32)we probably would've been better off going somewhere else and doing all you can eat for $17 a person. The meat was super oily and fatty. My bf ordered the rice cake dumpling soup and it was luke warm and the broth tasted like murky rice water. \nThis place is nothing to get excited about. Next time I'll never cheat on my go to Korean bbq spot....lesson learned! \n\nI wouldve given this place 1 star, but the restaurant was clean and that's pretty important to me.\nThanks for reading!"
1,"The Peppermill feels like a truly Las Vegas experience! Anyplace else in the world and this place would be quite out of place but in LV, it's freaking perfect! Neon all over the place and kitschy as hell! (In a good way) I know all the reviews talk about this but I can't stress this enough: the portions are huge!! If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive. That being said, I'd definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurant/lounge is just too kitschy/glitzy/vegasy (is that a word?) not to love."
1,"We live in Paradise Valley and drive all the way to Sushi Ken for the best tasting Tempura udon and yummy rolls.  My kids also love their kids menu!  This place reminds me of the Japanese places we used to go to when we lived in San Jose, CA."
1,I am a sushi lover and this place does it just right! \nNot only are they extremely affordable but the happy hour is phenomenal! From 4-6 and 8:30-close their sushi rolls are about 2 bucks and saki bombers (ichiban beer and warm saki) for only 5 bucks! \n\nThe cherry on top is definitely their A+ customer service. They are always friendly whether you are dining in or just taking out. \n\nI recommend this place as the #1 Japanese restaurant in Phoenix!
1,"Came in this morning for their $10 brunch and beer special and was not disappointed. My wife and I sat on the patio and enjoyed a delicious OHSO hefeweizen, a cool and sweet mimosa, the steak and eggs burrito with guacamole and the lox and bagels.\n\nThe service was great, it seemed our waiter was always nearby to refill our drinks on the warm patio. Not long after we got there, they turned on the misters, which made the experience much more enjoyable. The food was delicious; the burrito was simple and savory, and my wife loved the lox (you build your own sandwich, which she likes better). For everything we got, $10/plate with beer is a fantastic deal!\n\nI think the thing I like most about this place was the atmosphere. Every member of the staff were friendly, even bringing out water and snacks to the canine customers. The local beer selection is one of the best I've seen.\n\nI highly recommend this place, we may be making OHSO a staple for our weekend brunches to come."
0,"I plan on speaking with both the police department as well as the Attorney General about my most recent experience with 24/7. My son locked himself in his bedroom so I called 4 companies to see who could come out immediately before I called the fire dept. 24-7 quoted a 15 time frame. About 30 min later I called the \""technician\"" to find out what his location was and in a slurred speech he stated he was 6 miles away. He was rude and very annoyed by my call. I was at his mercy to have him unlock the door so I was kindly asked him to let me know if he has any trouble finding my home. 20 minutes later I called back and he wouldn't answer. I called the company back and the dispatch (female) told me that she would call him and call me back. She called me back about 7 min later and stated that he was pulling up now. I was relieved and ran outside. Nobody was there. I called her back about 5 minutes later and she said she would call me back. I never got a call back. It was now 1 hour and 20 minutes from a 15 min quote. She stated that she could not reach the technician and that I should call someone else. I was extremely disapointed and now needed to call the police. I called the police and explained the situation, they were very surprised by the situation and the fact that the technician was now MIA. The fire dept and police dept came out and fortunately took care of it. About 10 minutes later I received a phone call from the dispatch at 24-7 locksmith stating that the techinician is not someone that actually works for them however it is a friend of one of their employees and that he had been pulled over and detained by an officer. This is completely UNACCEPTABLE! Not only was this individual pulled over and detained for a good reason however they are sending someone into my home that is NOT an employee? Fortunately we have family in law enforcement and surveillance in our home otherwise I would feel very unsafe! I have asked for a call from the owner and never heard back. I will report this becuase this is NOT OK!"
0,"If you're expecting quality food, prepare to be disappointed.  Even more disappointing was the obnoxious, drunk owner who incredibly used the \""N\"" word while talking to us.  Unbelievable."
1,Great food! The curry is awesome! So is the Pad Thai and beef salad!!!! Really reasonably priced!
0,"Two words.\n\nHAIR + FLY.\n\nFound it in my pho. Obviously the the waiter was kind enough to not charge me for it.\n\nMy girlfriend was too grossed out to eat hers so we left. They still charged us...okay?\n\nBut at least they offered to give us another bowl. Yeah no thanks.\n\nHair and bugs in food is an automatic no for me.\n\nDon't come here, for the sake of not getting sick.\n\nAgain, HAIR + FLY. what the heck man."
0,"Went here and was so excited to try this place out! The management is awful! I was\nWalking back from the bathroom and ended up slipping on something that looked like grease or floor cleaner. The hostess saw me and asked if I was ok and that was it. She told me she'd have someone clean it\nBut apparently never did because minutes later, and older lady slipped in the exact same spot as me on the exact same grease.  Again, the same hostess came up to her too. You would think a manager or someone \""superior\"" would come up to the table asking if everything was ok.... But no. They acted like nothing happened. Fuck this place. Save your money. Terrible staff and crappy food."
1,"We do an \""ethnic dinner\"" every other month and this month it was my turn. I am SO glad that I picked Beaver Choice because it was fabulous.\n\nThe place itself is tiny and food is ordered from the front counter. The kid that was taking orders was very helpful and a real sweetheart. The wait time is considerable, but as long as you aren't in a hurry, the food is worth the wait.\n\nI ordered the Laxpudding with sides of broccoli, home made coleslaw, and dill potatoes. My friend ordered the Swedish meatballs.\n\nI'm not sure what I actually received since it doesn't seem to match the description of Laxpudding from their menu. I think what I actually received was the Salmonburger & Skagenrora. It was very good, but I'm not really a salmonburger kind of girl. The topping on it was fantastic though! \n\nThe broccoli was delicious and perfectly cooked. The dill potatoes were also very good and holy cannoli, they are seriously DILL. If you like dill, try these potatoes.\n\nMy friend raved about the Swedish meatballs - even scrapping the plate with her fork to try to get any of the remnants. She said they were better than Ikea which since I've never tried them and she says they are great, I'm going to assume this is a high compliment to Beaver Choice's meatballs.\n\nI got a Beaver Ball to go based on reviews on Yelp mentioning them. They were super chocolaty - I think dark chocolate? My husband swears there was coconut in them which he didn't like... I didn't notice coconut, but that doesn't mean anything.\n\nI can't wait to go back to try other things on their menu... especially the Schnitzel which is what they are known for. Delicious food and excellent, warm service. Great place!!"
1,"Heard a lot of high regard for the place and I figured wife and I would be disappointed and didn't feel like waiting in the line.  Figured it was more hype than actual goodness.  I was wrong.\n\nThe wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.\n\nSat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service.  Not the world's best BBQ, but very good.  The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal.  The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish.  Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good.  Wife had the brisket and was impressed.  Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.\n\nServing size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers.  Definitly a worth while visit.\n\nGreat staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food.  What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours."
0,"Stop two in my efforts to come up with a costume ended with nothing. A feeling of utter despair was increasing and I was ready to give up. Although it is a large store with ridiculous amounts to weed through, I came out empty handed. It is the nature of thrift stores. There is no guarantee of finding the exact item you are looking for. Small is not as plentiful as other sizes, so I was in and out quickly. \n\nThe staff here was friendly and was helpful with my inquiries."
0,"I have shopped at ULTA many times and usually have a decent experience. Not since moving to Henderson though. I use the ULTA rewards and back in California the points accumulate and you may use them towards anything in the store that your little heart desires. That is not the case here, you can only get certain items that you could purchase at target or walmart for cheaper than ULTA offers anyways. Also, the coupons that are frequently in my mailbox offering great savings do NOT work on any of the nice cosmetics I go there to buy, in fact you can't use the coupon on any thing \""high end\"" because they limit the \""Prestige cosmetics and skincare.\""  Its funny because the coupon says prestige then lists some brands but they mean all brands except what you can find at target and walmart as well as ULTA brand you are also not allowed to use the coupon on fragrances. The ULTAs in CA let you use the coupon on most makeup brands and fragrance among many other items in the store that the Henderson stores do not. I'm not really sure why there is such a difference, but my trips to ULTA are limited to what is actually on sale in the ad because the coupons are a joke and the staff is less than pleasant."

1,"Excellent food, not greasy, very fresh! I'm a very picky eater and the staff was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and making sure I got something I was happy with. The staff seems so happy to help you and the place was very busy for lunch on a Monday."
0,"Went in twice to have multiple sandwiches made and both times I was given an attitude.  One instance when I asked to have a sandwich remade because it fell apart I was snuffed at and the employee said \""are you serious.\"" And the huffed when I said yes how am I supposed to eat it.  I then called to speak with a manger and was told they were not in.  I asked for a phone number and was told they could not give it and I would have to call back."
1,"BBQ was AWESOME! \nWait us usually long, plan about an hour to get seated. They start taking names at 3, opens at 4pm. Seating area is small, booths good for parties of 2-4. 21+ only!\n\nFor Club members 12.99 gets you a rack of ribs, corn on the cob, beans and cole slaw! What could be better! Ribs were meaty! BBQ was great! Micro Brew beers were $2!! Totally worth the wait! Definitely will be back next time I am in town!!"
0,Horrible experience Don't stay at this hotel! \nFront desk manager is terrible Clarissa
0,"Terrible store. 1 star for the terrible service and another star only because the security going out was nice and the item I wanted happened to be on sale at checkout which was a nice surprise ! \nOther than that, the service sucked no one helped and the guy left while I was paying like what the heck. Also, I had to ask for help not offered (odd for future shop normally it's the opposite haha). Also they were playing music obnoxiously loud in the stereo section."
1,"I was very pleased with my style for my wedding. Dominique did a great job of mimicking the photo i showed her!\n\nMy only complaint was that it cost $80, when my hair is a mix between a short bob and a pixie.\n\nWhen i was first booking the appointment I asked for a blowout with some curls. and maybe some pins to secure them in place. And i was told, because pins may be used it could be an extra $10. Fine, I was ok with $50. But $80? No way. not for how short my hair is. She didn't even wash my hair. She lightly wet it and blow-dried it.\n\nHaving worked at a blowdry bar myself, I know the employes make hourly, not commission. So, its not like the overpriced \""updo\"" would have went to her anyway. She makes 8/10 an hr. And thats about all it took to do my hair. 70min. I could have tipped her more if the style wasnt so over priced. Accommodations should be made for ladies with short hair.\n\n\nAnyway, aside from the cost situation, I was thrilled with my style, and it lasted all night!"
0,"I'd give it a Big Fat Zero if I could! Tried to get in 4 times to sit at the bar. Tried different times and days but Nooooo! The snotty hostesses-which by now after 4 tries believe they take a course in this behavior- were indifferent, and were more interested in talking about their own lives them tending to those waiting! \n\nSo each time I dutifully waited to get two seats for me and my friend whiles others would come in after me and cut in -disregarding the fact that I'd been waiting - so I quietly would ask the host if they could politely say something but each time they just told at me there was nothing they could do! Are you kidding me? I'm waiting 10, 15, 20 minutes and rather than confront or police the situation myself I thought the hosts would help but it seems they relished the fact that I was in this predicament !  So NEVER again! Besides the menu, crowd, staff and location aren't all that . Not worth the time or effort !! Too many great places one can go around town!!!"
0,"Decent food (had the breakfast burrito, which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy), great location, but some of the worst live music I've ever heard in my life, right up there with some wedding reception noise!  The restaurant was full and ONE person, an employee who seemed to be the singer's girlfriend, applauded.  Dead silence from everyone else.  For several songs.  It was really bad.  I actually had the waiter change my order to takeout, but thankfully the \""musician\"" packed up soon after that.  The poor server apologized, and said they're working on the noise level, but I think they need to look at the talent level instead.  If I hear/see that awful LOUD caterwauling they call live entertainment again when I enter here, I will immediately turn around and leave.\n\nThis experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant.  My first time I walked in I was ignored, there was no one at the hostess stand area, and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silverware and pretending I wasn't looking at the menus.  I walked out after a bit.\n\nTwo strikes means I've yet to go back, since Los Tacquitos on 16th Street and Glendale is just as close, much faster, and the women working there (owners?) give great customer service.  Their quality probably isn't as high as Otro, but neither are their prices."
0,"I took our 13 month old there today as a guest of a member. The place was very clean, super spacious and even had a small designated toddler section. To my disappointment, this section filled up quickly with the older kids not giving much room for our toddlers to play. My biggest complaint isn't so much with the place itself as it is with the parents that don't keep an eye on their kids. My daughter was trampled by an older girl on the toddler slide only for me to get yelled at by her mother for saying something. A few minutes later the same girl was back in the toddler area throwing the building blocks over her head hitting my daughter and nearly hitting my friend's 1 year old. All this happening while the staff just watched and said nothing. Looks like I'll be finding another indoor playground for us.\n\n****edit**** My mistake for posting this on the wrong location! This should have been for the southwest location!"
1,"Wow if the owners here knows how to serve the sushi properly when patrons are sitting in front of the sushi bar, this place would be astounding. First of all, let me set something straight.... Mizumi is situated inside the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas and you'd expect the food to be pricy and.... IT IS! One thing I can say is that this place serves the FRESHEST FISH I EVER ATE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I've been to many great sushi restaurants in NYC but this places fish is top notch, GRADE A like how Colombians like their coke...if you know what im saying lol. \n\nGOOD:\nFreshest fish I've ever tasted.\nPieces are HUGE\n\nBAD:\nSushi rice is supposed to be in room temperature but its a bit cold. Flavor of rice could use a ITSY bit more of vinegar.\nNormally when you sit in front of a sushi bar, the chef serves each sushi piece by piece but not this place. \nAlso, the chef would brush the mixture of soy sauce onto your sushi prior to serving each piece but not this place....\n\nOverall, i'm giving it a 4 star is because of the quality of the fish and the huge portion that comes with it."
1,"Never would I have imagined this place being so popular on Yelp!  Went here for our last meal in Vegas after seeing all the positive reviews from yelp friends!\n\nI got the Caprese sandwich, since I'm a vegetarian.  You really can't mess up a caprese sandwich.  Or even make it any better... until you have Earl of Sandwich!  They made me an excellent caprese sandwich!\n\nIt's been a while since I went, but I remember the bread being perfectly toasted... not too soft and not crunchy where it's tearing up my gums.  It was a perfect combination of a crispy outside and warm soft fluffy bready-insides.  Then the buffalo mozzarella was so fresh, as were all the veggies that came inside my sandwich.  Most enjoyable caprese sandwich ever!\n\nMy fiance got a meatball sandwich, but he recalls it being just okay.  But after talking to so many people who rave about Earl of Sandwich, he's hyped up to go back and try a different sandwich!"
1,"Great Costo.  They are different than the regular warehouses.  Specializing in restaurant and convenience items this warehouse is packed with supplies and bigger food packs.  I love the selection of Torani products as well as prepared veggies (cut and ready to serve onions, lettuce, salads, etc)  They don't carry everything that regular Costco does and some things are too big for the regular home customer but the ability to buy plastic restaurant style glasses for cheap is terrific! (great for tile floors!)  I love the selection of snack foods and specialty drinks.  I also buy Thrifty Ice Cream here!"
0,"Went to Sahib today after managing to avoid it for four years and I was not disappointed, they confirmed my suspicions, it was mediocre at best. It is a basic Indian joint, a bit too dark, probably to hide the food that you are eating. \n\nI ordered the Tandoori meat platter just to sample a bit of everything and my wife the thali. Flavoring was okay but nothing to write home about. The vegetables they served were the frozen kind...yuck, but that is standard Indian restaurant fare so I can't complain. (My fault for giving in and trying this place). Food service was sporadic, waiter apologized several times for slow service from the kitchen., even said \""its not my fault\"". My plate was served in several parts as they forgot a portion of it.  My wife's thali arrived 5-8 minutes after my plate. The nan bread arrived ten minutes after the meal. The last piece of chicken was brought to me after the nan. I guess Rajiv was not in the building.\n\nOverall not for me ever again, but certainly to please the pallet of  the West Islanders judging by the reviews. Enjoy folks."
0,Last night I called Green Cab to come out to a location on East Washington Ave. below liberty tax.The dispatcher said nothing about the long wait-over an hour.Also green cad drove right pass me and never stopped!Plus they never called me.they had my number and asked for it.NEVER again.

0,"Ok, So I have lived here for almost a year...and am not renewing my lease for what I pay here I could get a nice house or town-home in the same area. I liked the area though and did not realize all the problems I would have upon moving in. My Sales Associate lied to me. I asked pretty specific questions upon moving in.  Upon moving in...I was told my Apartment was going to be a 3 bedroom on the third floor with new carpet...and paint...well when it came time to move in the apartment I was suppose to get was not ready, I had no choice because I had already vacated my last place...so they put me in another apartment, with stained carpet, shitty paint and tile and it still had furniture in it from the last tenant...and stuff in the drawers and cabinets...it had not even been cleaned and it was on the 2nd floor.\n\nHow much is the average electric bill I asked...they said no more then $200 in summer...mine has been closer to $300...nearly twice as much as what I was paying before I moved here for the same size unit.\n\n I asked how sound proof are the walls, am I going to be able to hear my neighbors...I live on the middle floor. They said I wouldn't it is a quiet complex, LIE...first night the people above me sounded like they were having a zumba class.  If you fart to loud your neighbors will probably complain...and the office will give you a ten day notice for farting to loud.\n\nThey failed to mention that the pet rent was a monthly charge not a one time fee. And this place is definitely not pet friendly, if you own a dog, and if that dog barks, don't live here...they will try to evict you every week for that one.  \n\nYou will get notices for everything.\n\nThey also did not explain that I would have to pay for water every month, which took them three months just to mail it to me. So your rent changes every month...it is never the same amount. Um...you pay the landlord the water bill not the water company...sound fishy!\n\nThis place sucks on all levels, the pictures do not do it justice, the apartments are old, the kitchen cabinets are 1990's, the fountain and grass are all gone, filled in with rocks and dirt. They landscaping sucks. Pool is ghetto, You can only get sun before 4pm otherwise it is blocked out by the buildings. And it is small, it is usually hoarded by fat people and screaming kids. And if anything breaks...it will take maintenance months to fix...because they never show up on time.\n\n The management office is a joke, no one is there to help you, they look at you like your a problem, I live in the biggest apartment they have and pay the most rent and pay on time...you think they would try to take care of a tenant like me...instead I get harassed.\n\nWorst Apartment complex ever.  Do not move in here. Move anywhere but here."
1,"For a place that doesn't hit any of my usual culinary hot buttons (ethnic, superb quality, fine wine list, creative) ... I still have to say that I do like Corbin's. Went there tonight after an unexplained hiatus of a few months (I was on hiatus, not Corbin's), and I realized that dinner was good, the previous lunches and dinners were good, service was good, atmosphere is good... and heck, while \""good\"" isn't fabulous, it ain't bad! \n\nThe burgers here are always a safe choice and all the varieties I've tried are tasty. The pizza thingies aren't my bag, but my dining companions have enjoyed them. The shredded pork salad is a great low-carb choice. Tonight I had the ahi appetizer. OK, the ahi wasn't the best quality - a little tough and very light pink -  but it was fresh and tasted just fine, especially for the price. The potato skins with pork were also tasty, and the husband liket the shrimp cocktail.\n\nIn summary, Corbin's isn't blow-your-socks-off good, but they are consistently decent, reasonably priced, and have decent service. Tonight's server was particularly good, striking the perfect balance of attentiveness and sincere friendliness without being pesky. \n\nMy husband looked up the $5/glass happy hour merlot on the internet to find that Wine Spectator gave it an 87. I wouldn't rank it anywhere near that high, but it's serviceable for $5/glass."
0,"It's got a ways to go. I debated a season pass the good part is they let you try the park out and if you have your receipt you can pay the difference for a season pass. I had $100 worth of cowabunga cash i wanted to use for admission, for some reason they kept ringing up invalid so the cashier had to get her boss who had to get his boss in which we waited a good 15 minutes for someone to fix the situation. I will have to come back to give a proper review but as of today a part of the park isn't open and 2 slides are not up. The green slide is down because its \""too fast\"". Employees were friendly and a few asked \""did we enjoy the park?\"" Which means they really care, however one cashier had no idea how to work the cash register and I ordered nachos which came with the tiniest cup of cheese and if I wanted more it was .75 cents it wasn't even enough for half the chips. Also, there were three icee machines and only one was working (watermelon/pi\u00f1a colada) and none of the soda machines were operational. I think next year I will buy a pass but not this year."
1,"Phipps is soooo pretty!! They have a wide variety of exhibits and they are constantly changing, so every time you go back you can see new things. \n\nI know you can rent out some areas, and some people have weddings there, but I imagine it would be pretty expensive. \n\nPhipps is a great way to spend a few hours on a lazy weekend."

0,"I read that the Chunk Chicken was awesome, well it wasn't.  $13 for a bowl of chicken???  Yes it came out in less than 5 minutes but there was nothing special about it.  For $13 you think that you would get more than a bowl of rice and $2 worth of chicken.  It was a bunch of semi over cooked chicken.  Nothing visually appealing and the taste, well, it was just OK.  I'll go back to try something else, but this was not the greatest of food everyone on yelp was applauding."

0,"Seriously, I am stunned at why there are so many good reviews about this place. I'll start by saying that I would normally give a place a second try if it wasn't the best experience.. as there re many factors as to what can go wrong on any night of service.. but this was so far less than mediocre that I don't have any desire to go back. \n\nFrom the start when my group of 4 walked in at 8pm, the bar was packed, but the booths were nearly empty as we took a stroll to look around. We did not get seated right away, but we were early. \n\nThe server didn't approach our table for nearly 10 minutes after we sat, and was in the vicinity at least 4 times... Finally,  she arrived and after ordering 3 martinis, that all came in completely different fashion than ordered.. and taking 15 minutes to get that sorted out.. it was at least 25 minutes before the server returned again. She was a mess.. and it didn't get better. \n\nI had the wedge salad which was just fine, and my friends all had the Soup of the day - Jambalaya... which isn't soup.. and actually was 'gumbo' by my account.. and was actually very good. A friend had a caesar that he said tasted stale. It tasted overly fishy to me and unbalanced. (We had it taken away which is how he ended up with the gumbo, jambalaya, soup thing)\n\nFor the main course we ordered 3 steaks and a seafood pasta dish. The  steaks were very poor quality. I mean the ribeye was $32 .. and while that isn't the most expensive price for a steak of that sort, its a pretty hefty price tag for a garbage piece of meat.  It was ALL fat.. not marbled evenly and not very good grain to the meat at all.. just trash. I literally had 3 bites. Were it not for the martini and the 2 glasses of wine, I may have cared more.. but I was sharing with my friend and she switched with me for the seafood pasta. \n\nEvery, single scallop.. we counted 6 .. was sandy.. which to my knowledge means unwashed or from a can.. and unwashed. The sauce was meant to be some form of scampi I thought, but it was watery and thin and just not that good. Any of these complaints were not registered because the server never came back to check on us.\n\nOk, longest story short.. the server didn't return to the table until the check was dropped. The bussers basically took care of us until that point. Not only was the caesar salad on the check, but she added an 18% gratuity to the bill.  Is this standard practice for sub par service and food? She was no where to be found, and my companions decided to leave it since we  would not be returning. '\n\nI would not consider going to this place ever again unless something drastic happened, like it changed ownership. Honestly it was bad."
1,All you can eat and drink?! Oh yeah!! I've been waiting to try this place for so long. The drive is 10miles from the strip but well worth it. I came here for the Saturday brunch with my boys. We ate and drank up a storm. This place is really big and well lit up. The number of foods to choose from were out of this world. I'll recommend some of my favorite things to eat.\n\nSalmon sushi: Some pieces were beautifully fatty. I ate loads of this and threw away the rice. \n\nPrime rib: When you get a fatty one thats cooked medium rare then it's awesome. So juicy and tender. \n\nMimosa: endless amounts of champagne and oj. I left this place stumbling! \n\nSmoked Salmon bagels: Seriously the salmon here is too good! This normally would cost $10 for one. I ate so much of it. \n\nThose were the items I kept coming back to. They really had so much to choose from. I would definitely come back here.
1,"We moved to Dr. Nishihara from another pediatrician in town and we are so happy we did!  It is very interesting to see what people do not like about him since that is exactly why we love him for our daughter.  Dr. Nishihara has a very conservative, basic approach to children and I love that she gets to hear things from him that she doesn't always listen to coming from me!  I don't find it rude at all that he gives her advice like, \""make sure you always wear a helmet when you are riding your bike.\""  It keeps me in check on things that I should be doing and let's her hear this basic advice from someone she truly respects.  She loves going to the Dr because of him and at 4 years old, I find that a great thing.  I will continue to take my children there and recommend Dr Nishihara to anyone who asks.  I love that the office is clean and never crowded and that they hold everyone accountable for appointments, as they are always keeping up their end of the deal."
0,"The outside appearance of Lucille's is certainly appealing and we love BBQ.  Thus, our decision for a late lunch.  The place had a few full tables but it definitely was not very busy at all.  We were promptly seated but waited what seemed like forever for a waiter to appear for our drink orders.   Then, it took forever again until he showed up for our order.  We were just getting ready to leave money for the drinks on the table when he finally strolled over.  Needless to say .... service was awful.\n\nWe love barbecue.  Since we lived in Texas for many years, we know what Texas barbecue is.  It's not Lucille's barbecue.  My husband ordered the Texas BBQ sandwich.  It was too spicy.  He didn't eat it.  I had the 1/4 BBQ chicken and baby back ribs luncheon special.  It must have been an awful small chicken.  The chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked and the ribs weren't cooked long enough to come off the bone.  You would normally think a waiter would ask how you liked the meal especially when the plates are taken back nearly full --- not so.  \n\nIf you want better barbecue, I would suggest a trip across the parking lot to Dave's or to Joe's BBQ.  Hands down those two places are not only better but they are a lot cheaper."
1,This place was a last minute thought on our Vegas excursion. This place is EXPENSIVE but so worth the cost. They have a great wine selection as well. To start we had their signature stone crab claws. The crab was served cold so threw me off a bit but when I tasted it boy was it AMAZING. Then the Steak we ordered was huge... So we ended up splitting it with some still left over. This literally melted in your mouth. Our server was adorable and so attentive to our table. We were seated in the front dining area. I wouldn't mind swinging by for a lunch or dinner here when I hit up Vegas again.
1,"Darden employees have done it once again! They never fail me in showing excellent service with their customer loyalty that Darden dearly values. The customer and employee relationship that starts, as soon as you are seated, is absolutely phenomenal! This Yardhouse at the LINQ is a must visit! The unique parts of this restaurant are the floating kegs on the second floor, Most but not all employees in here is your friend and EAGER to make your first and every experience the best you've ever had. I never feel hesitant to speak to an employee for specific concerns or needs in food on the menu. Whether it is having an allergy to an ingredient or just simply not liking a particular part of the food you want to order. These employees are very willing to make you a happy customer by always going out of their way to accommodate you!  One advice I can leave you with is, be patient with this location for another year because they are fairly new, if some employees don't give superb customer service, the right information, or don't know every question, you could let a restaurant manager know to train them better. Communication is what makes the world go round! It solves many issues or concerns. I would love mention specific employees who give BEYOND excellent service each time, Martin, Jason, Ryan, and Sky."
0,"Stayed during the week June 18th through June 22nd. Starting with the good. Stayed on the 23rd floor and had a strip view, it had easy access to aria and Bellagio and the casino wasn't good or bad. The pool area looked nice but was way packed mid week so I couldn't even imagine trying to be down there on the weekend. Price wasn't bad on paper but the Internet cord they provide didn't work, the shower had a ton of mildew, the hallway on our floor was always wet. Really wet. The aroma gives you a headache, I would rather just smell the smoke. My wife and I both cut our feet on the tac strip in the room. I called downstairs to let them know about the issues and told them ahed of time I'm not looking for anything free just giving the info, and they were rude. My family and I will be going back to the MGM as soon as the construction is done."
0,Poorest customer service I've ever seen in not just the restaurant industry but in any service.  Manager was unbelievably rude.  Will never go back next time I'm in Champaign and hope nobody else makes the mistake of going here.
1,"Ahhhh.... Now here's a reasonably priced used book store with a wide selection. Many thanks to Alicia for the recommendation. Could definitely have spent more time and money here but somehow managed to pull  myself away with a few choice Joyce Carol Oates short story collections I haven't been able to find at Bookman's or Half Price Books. I know, I know, just order them online, right - but where's the fun in that? I need the thrill of the hunt! Friendly & knowledgeable staff, wide selection, good location... what else can you ask for?"
0,"I didn't think this place lived up to the reviews at all! Pretty disappointed actually. I ordered the french toast and it was barely cooked! Lets say it was lightly seared on each side. Disgusting. And at $10 an order, very disappointing. My husband had the breakfast bowl and he enjoyed that, said it was a bit spicy though and he loves spicy food. For the money, this place is not worth it in my opinion."

0,"Evidentally if you're not within 5 feet if the door, it's too much trouble to ask the hostess to check outside and call your name.

0,"The Luxor is probably one of the best looking hotels on the strip from the outside....  \n\nUnfortunately for me and others who stay here on there visit to Las Vegas this hotel is nothing more than the a 1or 2 star hotel, disguised as a 4 or 5 star hotel on the inside.  The room does not match the architecture, the elevator feels like a death trap, the decor is lame and outdated, and the housekeeping isn't the best.  \n\nIn fact, I ask the standard housekeeping immigrant guy you always see pushing the towel cart for some towels and he said \""No\"", I was shocked.  I decided to just go the other route, and just took some off the cart and kept it pushing without asking."
1,"Very tasty bbq.  Lots of different sauces are set out for sampling.  There is seating but it's a pretty no-frills atmosphere.  That's part of the charm, but I wouldn't suggest this place for a business luncheon or a romantic date.  But if you want tasty bbq, you won't be disappointed."

1,"We had been wanting pizza but didn't want to do an overpriced eatery at a casino.  After checking the reviews on Yelp we decided to stop by on our way out of town.  The staff was extremely nice and explained the process.  It's very similar to Chipotle where you start with a blank canvas and they build it from there.  They have 7 types of specialty pizza to choose from or you can build your own with as many toppings as you want for only $12.  The location isn't the best, but its worth the trek if you want cheap, tasty pizza!"
1,"Went here last night for happy hour with my hubby before checking out a show.  The service was impeccable from the hostess Angela to all of the bar staff.    We both shared crab cakes, 2 pizza's one shrimp and the other sausage and pepper as well as the salami cheese platter.  The Italian Stallion there version of a dirty martini was to die for with blue cheese and salami stuffed olives .  The bartender Blaise also made some killer shots with espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua.  If you are looking for a place with cheap drinks this is not the spot however if you are looking for attentive service, an awesome view and some amazing drinks and grub you should check this place out."
0,"I was not impressed by this restaurant at all. The flooring is all carpeting and it is disgusting. Please vacuum and deep clean it. Even better just replace that nasty floor. The menu was dirty and sticky. Just clean the restaurant!!! The rolls were nothing to brag about, just average food. Even the roll presentation was bad. We will not be returning."
1,"The only shop that you can trust,\nFast and professional, \nAnd thanks G-d that we have people like Vitalik Pinhasov here in Arizona.\nAs a rabbi I recommend this shop to everyone that need."
0,"Well I must have really missed something here. My husband and I ate here tonight and arrived excited and hungry. Neither of us left happy, nonetheless full, of what I am not sure, sodium perhaps. Oh I forgot, my ahi salad had no flavor and my husbands crab cake sandwich apparently received the entire salt shaker. Tried the egg salad dip. I can live the rest of my life without this again. Bland egg salad topped with super salty bacon and blue cheese. Never again. Btw, we paid 14 dollars for the salty sandwich and 16 dollars for the salad a two year old could have put  together. This of course would have been a three star review if maybe the server didn't feel as to put us last on his list. We waited after finishing our dinner, obviously done, for at least fifteen minutes before he removed the plates and we had the opportunity to ask for the check. Something on our faces must have clued him in not to ask any questions, just told us we could go next door if interested in dessert. I am thinking the cocktails must be good, we do not drink,  but think it is definitely important to drink here."
1,Went last nite!  The fish in foil was the best. So much flavor and cooked perfect!  Will be back to try other dishes. Also great idea that they offer half size portions!
0,The place is pretty clean the people are really friendly service I see you at the some of the stuff is really overcooked and the sushi is really dry other than that it's pretty good service is just I have experience better buffets but maybe it's just because it's so late in the evening and in the weekend I am going to come back and try it again a second time and see how things change and then I will do a update.
0,"Inquired about an oil change promo I heard on the radio, also have a check engine light on dash. The oil change special is for $10 off or is actually $21.95 after discount. The check engine light they said would require a diagnostic charge of $99. That to me sounded excessive, given many places will do it for free or low cost."
1,"I've been going to Valley spas for about 10 years now, and while there are some fantastic, beautiful spas around, I still hadn't found the right massage therapist.  I finally found John.\n\nI've never scheduled a massage on an \""emergency basis\"".  After months of traveling without any down time, my body had finally said enough.  With how tight my shoulders, neck and lower back were I thought I must be walking around looking like Quasimodo.  Within one 60 minute session, I felt like the world had been righted.  \n\nI was a little hesitant trying someone new, based only on Yelp reviews, and going to their house, but when every single person who has done a review has concurred with 5 stars you know that something special is going on at Space.  I'm so glad I gave it a whirl!  I booked my follow up appointment before I even left."
1,"I have a mom-van with close to 100K miles on it.  The gas mileage is miserable.  Instead of buying another new van, I decided to take a look at smaller, cuter cars with better gas mileage and just demote the mom-van to road trips and costco.\n\nI always dread car-buying time and view it as a necessary evil.  I'm not a car person and I don't get excited about the prospect of something new to drive, so all the hassle of research, negotiation, paperwork is doubly annoying.  I always attempt to make first contact by email to see which dealers will work with me on my own terms.  I'm at home with 5 kids and I'm the only driver in the house.  I don't have the time or head space to drive all over town comparing prices, features, etc.  That's why we have the internet!  The problem is, so many car dealers are still stuck back in 1985.  \""You seem to have a lot of questions!\"" they'll say, \""Come on down so we can answer them all for you!\""  No.  If I'm throwing 20 grand or more around, I want to have time to think about it.\n\nRob at Autonation was the first to respond to my email with a detailed answer.  We hammered out all the details in a series of emails throughout the day as I made lunch, helped with Math, brushed out tangles, or in traffic (ssh!  Always at the red lights!).  That is literally the only way I can buy a car.  Rob is a sweetheart. When I finally narrowed my search to two cars and went in to test drive, he had them tucked away in the garage and had carved out as much time from his day as I needed.  He walked me through all the features, had ready answers to all my questions, and  never insulted my intelligence or made me feel stupid.  He provided a concierge-like service the likes of which I've never experienced at a car dealership, even when we bought my husband's BMW back in the day before the economy crashed.  Sigh.\n\nAnyway, you still have to do your homework (Rob L. down below, I'm looking at you, guy...that information is all over the internet!) and know what you're buying, what it is worth, and what you can afford.  They're going to haggle.  They're in business of selling cars.  But I never felt like someone was trying to do an end run around me.  Negotiations were straight forward and I walked away satisfied that I got plenty for my money.  \n\nThanks guys!  Maybe I'll pop in sometime and say hi when I'm up that way visiting my daughter :)"
0,"Something's fishy, and I don't mean the food. How can this place with limited menu, an insanely long line, cramped bar located within a smoky casino be rated THE best restaurant in Vegas according to Yelp?\n\nI've dined here 3 times now before I felt compelled to write about my informed opinion of this place. Here's what I've encountered all 3 times:  beginning stages of lung cancer while walking through the casino, continuing on with my early stages of lung cancer while waiting in line for 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, jammed into a bar top that seats about 20 people while dining on mediocre food still inhaling the aforementioned smoke.\n\nService? Mediocre at best, all 3 times. Items are forgotten, timing is off and many workers don't seem happy to be there. The experience is rushed solely because you can constantly sense the stares and anguishing hunger from those waiting in line 5 paces behind you...stalking like wolves; waiting for their prey to fall off their chair in utter gluttony.\n\nThe food?  I've had the gumbo twice and the pan roast once. Both were decent, barely bordering on good and I refuse to return again and wait that long in a line for decent food.  Knock my socks off with food and service in a nice atmosphere...maybe worth those waits, but not this place as it currently stands.  All 3 visits I ordered my food mild...all three times the following day was not a good day, stomach-wise. Yes, something is fishy.\n\n\nGood news for the rest of you who decide to forge ahead with this place; there will be one less sucker waiting in line and taking up your coveted seat at the oyster bar. Enjoy!"
1,"First, let me say that I'm not one to eat at a buffet, sorely because i lose my appetite when I see piles of foods on trays lined up from one end of the wall to another.\n\nI was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic.\n(that's 1 star)\n\nThe buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other \""international theme\"") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs.\n(that's 2 stars)\n\nThis is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes.\n(that's 1 star)\n\nI got a bad impression of our server at first because instead of neatly placing our silverwares on the table, she would just toss it from the other end of the table, so I had to catch my fork as bouncess across the table. \n(that's -1 star)"
1,"What a lovely wee shop!\n\nAs has been said Pinnies and Poppy Seeds sells a variety of gorgeous goodies in the form of shortbread, truffles and toffee (I think these are all regulars) and a few other offerings depending on the season. \n\nI popped in recently to get some Christmas gifts - early I know but I'm headed home for the holidays soon and am trying to get as much purchasing as possible out of the way. Jennifer, the lovely owner, advised me that the best thing to buy at this time would be the toffee as the shortbread really wouldn't keep for the month. Entirely fair enough. So, I loaded up on toffee and snuck in a few tasty treats for myself and my husband. I went for the chocolate orange shortbread (SO good - I especially loved the orange sugar on top) and the billionaire's shortbread truffle (nomnomnom)  - I ate half of each right then and saved the second half for The Man. \n\nIt's so nice to see a few places opening up on/near the Royal Mile which sell things which people who live in Scotland would actually want to buy, instead of the standard tourist tack that you usually find on the Mile.  As an added plus, the shortbread is just the perfect thing to give you a few extra springs in your step after a long day of sightseeing and/or Christmas shopping."
1,My husband and I needed to give a gift to someone who has everything.  We have each eaten Nothing Bundt Cakes before and thought it would be a sweet treat as a gift.  We got our friend the full sized red velvet cake.  She really enjoyed it!  We got ourselves the mini to share!  \nThe cake is so delicious and moist.  Really cute shop with a helpful staff.  They have 2 locations and both deliver.  Prices aren't bad...the minis are only $4 and the biggest cake you can get (which I think feeds up to 18 people) is only $28.  Not a bad way to say thanks or just treat someone!
1,"Went to check out the Cosmo hotel, and could only find this fine dining establishment open at lunch time. It was absolutely mind boggling that you can get top notch quality dining for $20.12. They only offer this prix fix option at lunch.  We started with the diver scallops, tasted so fresh, someone brought them up 24 hours before being put on my plate, but you only get 3!, anyways YUM! My husband upgraded to the Lobster spaghetti for an extra $15.  The lobster presentation is top notch. You get the complete lobster body split in half with the spaghetti in the middle, so get ready to shoot a picture before you dig in. I had the Lavraki fish, delicate, lovely dish.  We both enjoyed the yogurt martini for the dessert portion. If you don't like Greek yogurt, don't order. The yogurt is mixed with strawberry puree and sweetened just right.   Don't pass this lunch deal up.  Since most meals we had in other fine dining establishments are 3 times this much for the same items.  If you loved the Lavraki fish here, you've got to go try the Loup De Mer dish at Central in Caesars.  The best light fish dish I had on the strip so far."
0,"I can't believe I failed to write my review so long ago! The memories still leave me shuddering... bleh.\n\nThis place suuuucks. Food, service, prices, everything! The colorful, \""chaotic\"" decor was what brought my friends, husband and I in on one not-yet-drunken afternoon for lack of more variety of places to eat in our hotel, and we were starving.\n\nI immediately Yelped and was pretty terrified to eat here. I mean really, I think a restaurant actually has to work at it to get so many incredibly low ratings. Once seated we ordered one of those massive margaritas which my girlfriends shared (such a waste of money; the cup is shaped like a fatty goblet but is really hollowed out like a wine flute inside.. bye bye $$$). \n\nI ordered what seemed to be the safest thing on the menu - a cheese quesadilla with guacamole ($11.90 + 2.00 for guac... this thing better be gourmet!). I can't remember what everyone else ordered but they all seemed to shoot for \""safer\"" options as well. My top-dollar quesadilla, which was really just a couple flour tortillas with melted shredded cheese in between, arrived with no guac. I tried to flag our waitress down but she completely ignored us after our food was delivered.\n\nThen we tried to flag her down again for another round of waters. Ignore, ignore, ignore - we got the attention of a busboy who said he'd tell her but she still never came. \n\nThen they turned on that hokey cha cha slide song and tried to get everyone up, servers and patrons, to dance. Our waitress amazingly reappeared to try and drag me to dance and I kindly refused and asked, \""can I just get a water please??\"" She ignored me and went to dance. I honestly could not believe her!\n\nIn the end we never got waters, I never got guac (and she attempted to charge me for it), and our waitress \""split the bill\"" between me and my friends but charged some of their expensive margarita onto mine. When I pointed out the error she said I was wrong, and the bill was just fine. I was done fighting with her so we paid and left NO tip. I can count less than five times in my life I've done that but in this case it was well-deserved. We will NEVER go back"
0,"My previous review is still attached at the bottom because my prior opinions still stand, but I had to elaborate after my AWFUL experience today :(. It's a real shame because their jjambbong is one of the best in the city; the yookgaejang, pajun, and banchan are all pretty good.. but the prices are absolutely obscene!!! Come on.. it doesn't cost THAT much to make Korean food!! $30-34 for one order of galbi?! $12.95 for all special dishes such as stews and noodles? $20 for PAJUN, which is probably the most obscene. \n\nI went to Jin Mee today with a group of friends and tried ordering AYCE bbq and they said they're currently not offering this deal because of the CES convention. I ordered my usual extra spicy jjambbong and they greatly disappointed me by saying that they don't make any of the dishes on their Chinese menu due to the convention. Last time we all came here, they said they couldn't make it because it was too late... this time they claimed they're not making it at all. I asked for the steamed egg (usually provided as a complimentary side dish with all Korean BBQ) and they said it would be $5 extra!! That was strike 3 that put me over the edge and extremely agitated...  Nevertheless, we tried to put it all aside and enjoy a good dinner with good company. THEN, as we were leaving the restaurant.. what did I see a few tables away from us??? A bowl of jjambbong that was served to a man, woman and their baby. I was officially appalled! \n\nI don't believe the people here know how to run a successful restaurant/business or to be hospitable toward local regulars. Then, they take away all of their best assets during specific times when there are a lot of tourists in town... Sadly, my review went from 3 stars to 1 :(\n\n\nMy former review: \nI actually became a regular here and on average, my overall experience has not been so good. The food is fantastic, which is why I keep going back; however, I feel they do not run their restaurant properly. Their AYCE Korean BBQ is definitely their best asset and a great deal! The variety they offer for AYCE is generous and it's a great way to have a group dinner..... which is WHY I took my friends from LA here the other night, but they weren't offering AYCE because of the convention! She explained that during convention days, it's not an option. I also went there to order their jjambbong (my all-time favorite dish that's both Chinese and Korean), and they said their Chinese menu is limited to before 10pm. It was disappointing to be a hostess and show off a place I loved so much, only to be limited to the typical, overpriced Korean menu.... they have all these strict rules where they can't serve something a certain way, or you can't take the jjigae from AYCE home when it's actually not refillable, and extra rice costs $... these are all not how I portray a great Korean restaurant. Korean service is usually a lot more generous and flexible to your liking, and needless to say.. I was disappointed with the operations of this place. Also, they were not generous with the banchan (side dishes) either. The raw crab that I LOVE was not provided... it was more of a \""limited\"" selection, all because of the convention that was going on. A restaurant should actually put its best foot forward in times of good business... and they most certainly did not.\n\nThe jjambbong for me was \""tied\"" with the one from Elephant Snack next door, which so far are my favorite jjambbongs in Vegas. They still don't compare to the ones you can find in Los Angeles or NYC, so once again, I'm still on the hunt. If anyone has recommendations, please let me know!\n\nUnless you're going as a group during a time when they provide AYCE BBQ, there are other Korean restaurants in Vegas I prefer that are more affordable, flexible, and the service is much friendlier."

0,Way too over-priced for a not-so-great bowl of pho. The pho was bland and not worth $16. The duck noodle soup wasn't great either. The duck was on the dry side. I will never coming back!!!
0,"PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION!! The staff here are crazy RUDE and they even lied about what they were still serving. They told us they were out of dishes but then served the same dishes to another table behind us. We had to fight for our food and called the manager since everyone was ignoring us. Manager there is great btw! Only reason this place had 2 stars. Once we called him, we finally had better service. Food here gets a C- as far as quality of Dim Sum. Dumpling and bun exterior a little hard and didn't taste fresh. Listen, bottom line is in Vegas there are a lot better places to spend your money than Ping."
0,"It is very stressful dealing with these thieves.  Discriminatory practices where they charge different prices for different customers.  I have polled numerous friends and people that I work with to see what they are paying, and what services they receive.  It seems that I pay the most for the least amount of options.  Why is that? I don't have cable boxes in every room or a DVR or their super fast internet option, and I only have HBO, but so many people that I spoke to do have these options as well as additional movie channels, and are paying about $50 less than I do each month.  I tried to negotiate with them but to no avail.  Funny how other people call to complain about the pricing, and Cox is willing to negotiate with them but not me.  That's discriminatory and immoral."
0,"Horrible experience. Called last Thursday to set up an appointment for this morning at 8am. 8:04, still no plumber. Called them and they tell me he is stuck in traffic and will be here in 30 minutes. No way. Had he left early enough he might be 10 minutes late but 30, absolutely not. He didn't leave 'till 8. I said even if that's true, it's not but let's assume it is, why wouldn't you call me? No answer, no apology. So the \""plumber\"" shows up at 8:28 and I say \""you're 30 minutes late\"" and he said \""28\"". What a dick. No \""I'm sorry\"", such a prick. So, their job is to shut the water off at the street, 9:15, this moron still can't figure it out. Have to wait another half hour for his boss to show up. Finally the water is off, takes 90 minutes longer than promised. What a laughing stock. This company sucks. Their service levels blow. Avoid them at all cost."
1,"Been here twice, the last time was in Jan 2011.\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful in it's decor and the Picasso paintings are breathtaking and beautiful. It IS business casual dress & the service is very very good. The Sommelier here really knows his wines and was not only helpful but enlightened us about some wine regions.\nWe ordered the tasting menu & allow me to say that the Lobster Salad was outstanding. Perfect in every way. Of course I am a big fan of Julian Serrano & love his food.  I first had his cuisine at Masa;'s in San Francisco and I was hooked instantly! The menu here at Picasso offers fish as well as Steak, Lamb etc....The Halibut with Asparagas was outstanding and the Hollandaise sauce was the best I have ever tasted & perfectly balanced. The halibut was cooked perfectly and the portion was the right size. My husband had the \""A\"" Steak and he said it was outstanding.\nThis experience lasted well over 2 hours and it was totally enjoyable.\nPrices are high but in Vegas it is what you expect to pay at a restaurant of this caliber, meaning a Michelin Star restaurant.\nThe service is good and the food is beautiful to look at. After all you begin to eat with your eyes !!"
1,"This is hands down my favorite Vegas buffet! I'd imagine that the basics have been well covered in the other 900+ reviews, but I just wanted to throw in my favorite items from my delicious visit! \n\n-Thanksgiving-y food: Forget crab legs and shrimp! This girl judges a buffet by its turkey and mashed taters, and these were scrum-diddly-umptious along with the tasty stuffing! Yum.\n\n-Corn Chowder: soup of the day. Very tasty!\n\n-Oreo Gelato: Hey, you're probably on vacation, but these are fat grams you wouldn't regret even if you aren't. So evil!\n\nWeekday lunch is an especially good value, but you won't find much seafood, if that's what you're after. \n\nThe only things I think could be jazzed up a little are the music selection (odd), and the random images on the huge screens, save for the ones on either end that run Food Network. I don't like to see Paula Deen staring at me, ever. And as much as I secretly enjoy the dancing fruits and veggies, they make me giggle when intermixed with flower blossom and river scenes. Hehe.\n\nOverall, I want to live at this buffet and never leave!!"
1,"Bought my 2008 TSX here, and loved the experience compared to other vehicles I've purchased.  I'm actually here now getting an oil change, which is a steal compared to other shops around town: 3 oil changes for $50!  Would much rather wait for my car to be serviced here... fridge full of free sodas and water, and usually they have snacks like bagels and donuts.  Very happy that they finally figured out that giving away wifi to their customers was a no-brainer."
1,Fantastic & memorable experience! Taylor and Kevin handled the entire process with professionalism and class. They sincerely valued me as a customer and went out of their way to ensure my satisfaction. I am writing this note in hopes that it influences others to contact them and benefit from the service Zimbrick BMW provides. This dealership should be considered the standard and I am glad to have one I can trust the next time I am in the market.
1,"They have really great gluten free pizza and delish salads. My husband isn't gluten free and ordered the shawarma and though it was good too. The TV's at the table allows is nice for the kiddos. I would have given it five stars if they served beer and wine. I think we will be regulars here. Oh, and I love how the owner is there to greet you. You don't see that very often these days."
1,"My boyfriend & I went here for an introductory lesson.  Nikki was a fantastic teacher, and Martin was very welcoming when we arrived at the studio.  Only a lack of money kept me from signing up for more lessons on the spot.  Great studio, keep up the good work Nikki & Martin. :)"
1,"Depending on your style or clothing preference, this outlet may be or may not be for you.  If you're more in to the higher type class clothing I suggest you head out to the premium outlet near downtown vegas but if you're in to surfing brands, good kicks, and skinny jeans, this place is for you.\n\nLevis is always having great discounts on their jeans so before you go paying for it full priced at the near by Town Square, this place is just about 5 min drive away and if you want to save, why not check it out.\n\nQuicksilver, Hurley, Billabong, and even Oneil are all here, so duuude come on braaaah, check these places out for totally awesome sales duuude.  \n\nNow for the kicks....Nike, Adidas, Converse and other great brand names are here too.  Im not really knowledgeable when it comes to how much these shoes should be compared to whats out there because all I buy are chucks so I can't really tell you whether the deals here are great or not.  \n\nThis place isn't as nice or as big as the Premium but its really close to where I live and has all the stores I prefer and this is the reason for my 4 star."
1,"I really enjoyed the patio setting at the Vig. I went for an early dinner, and there weren't too many people there. It's a walk in and seat yourself deal, so there was no wait. I ordered the Mac n Cheese with bacon, and I give it a solid four stars. The portion was huge, the taste was solid, the price was decent, and the ambiance was nice--as expected. I recommend checking this place out. (Not with a baby--you'll get disgusted looks from hipsters and wait staff alike.)"
1,"Protein Waffle is to die for. This local institution is a fan favorite for all SF Giant fans attending spring training at Scottsdale stadium. I have to say the food here is delicious. I always get the triple play combo with their famous protein waffle. The protein waffle is their Belgium waffle batter with granola, blueberries, cinnamon and other goodness mixed in. Mmmmmmm!!! I also love that their juices are fresh squeezed. I am subtracting one star though because the last time few times I went there the lack of service by the waitresses were subpar. It was neither spectacular or horrendous."
0,Service was ok... My pasta was over cooked .
0,I've only been for lunch and everything is drenched in red sauce.  I really didn't care for it.
1,"Fiesta filipina is the best when it comes to pilipino food. It's clean, the people greet you promptly and nicely  when you come. The owners  really take care and make you feel at home. The portions are big and they have everything down so that quality and the taste is consistent in both of their restaurants. I recommend  their Crispy Pata, sisig na bangus, and their famous barbecue. The halo halo is also very  good loaded with all the best ingredients topped with Leche flan and ube ice cream. I use to drive to their  Jones location and I am so glad that they now have the Henderson store. A big bonus is the price too. Where can you buy good food at a very reasonable  Price?  Only at Fiesta."
0,drive through is horrible customer service..
1,"The Best Fried Catfish in las vegas. I wish everyone should come and taste their yummy catfish, it's the bomb. We felt in love with their foods the minute we taste it.\n\n We already went back for the third time and it won't be our last. People are very friendly here and service are the best. The cook deserve a big kiss from us, thank you Mario."
1,"My new favorite sports bar.  I've heard about RT's but never came.  Finally, my visit here is well received.  \n\nCame after a fight night, but apparently they show the fight here too.  Plus, all the NFL games.  Service was not at it's best, but maybe because we sat in the patio.  The place definitely had the Irish sports bar feel and look.  The men's restroom was interesting, but let me tell you about the women's restroom.  I was invited in because my gal pal said I had too see this.  Needless to say there's a huge Troll looking back at you in the mirror -- totally awesome, but spooky.  \n\nWhy do I like this joint?  Dancing drunk old man and the drinks are cheap.  Take a shot of whiskey to warm yourself in the patio and enjoy your company. - Enjoy!"
1,"Love love love their food. Really innovative in combining technique with different flavors. \n\nThe stand outs are their kushi oysters with Tabasco sorbet and tequila mignonette, and poached egg with potato and truffles. \n\nThey also have smaller portions of items at their bar if you don't want the whole dining room experience.\n\nBut if you do want the entire experience, I highly suggest their $89 chef menu. You get a good menu with choices in each course. \n\nA must go if in Las Vegas."
0,"After my poor, 4m old Alaskan Klee Kai got attacked by a mean and aggressive chihuahua back in 2009, she was not the same, sweet and well-tempered doggie. She would display aggression toward unfamiliar dogs that came near her and myself and would guard my fiance and me. I was in desperate need for help and asked some fellow dog owners on places to have her trained.\n\nWe scheduled a consultation with one of their trainers at the facility and he said he was concerned that my dog was displaying a bit of dog jealously when she saw me giving attention to another dog. He also explained that their e-collar was NOT a shock collar but was a training device to grab the dog's attention and wouldn't place the collar past 3 out of 10. I was initially impressed by their techniques as it appeared to work on my dog. However, I call BULLSH*T because at one point during one of the trainings the trainer had REPEATEDLY put the collar up to 8 to get my dog's attention.\n\nEven though I had experienced, first hand, how the e collar felt, I thought a 3 out of 10, which the trainer said had said SMS would never go above,  would be an acceptable threshold for my dog. 8 out of 10 on that collar is just straight up cruel and uncomfortable. FEEL an 8 out of 10 on YOUR OWN NECK/HAND etc.; it's a crappy feeling. I felt that I didn't get much out of the 3 trainings that cost close to some ridiculous price over 500 bucks....we were not taught anything outside of the \""place\"" command and I didn't feel that we learned how to use the e-collar as effectively to grab her attention. As a result, my dog seemed to experience more anxiety and it didn't fix her aggressive behavior but probably exacerbated it.\n\nTrust me, I followed everything the trainers told us to do but unfortunately this left my dog with an unimpressive improvement in her behavior and my fiance and I broke. I don't see what I did wrong except to decide to go with SMS rather than doing my research on dog trainers in the Valley. While I'm sure this technique would work for other dogs with specific temperaments, this technique was a total fail on my dog. So, before you resort to SMS, please do some research!"
0,The desert was pathetic. The food was not so good.
0,"For starters they want you to get in line exactly opposite of what their signs say. Second chef was rude as can be, Tip for him, the pizza cooks faster when your not opening the door every five seconds to look at it. Also during your rush maybe have a couple pies going so there would be less wait time. The whole reason I'm writing this is that a girl had a slice of cheese to go that got cold. She went up to chef and asked for him to warm it up or replace it. He took he cold piece and put it back on the pizza bar to be reserved and grabbed her a fresher one. I would have left right then but figured i had a whole pizza coming so i wouldn't have any of those scraps. The whole thing was greasy and nasty. Stay away from this place, they have plenty of good places right across the strip. Worst 25 min wait for what i was severed ."
1,I live in Los Angeles and I had to leave asap and they were able to fix my car quickly and with a smile. Left me extremely happy.
0,"After all the positive reviews the hubby & I decided to check it out. Upon entering everything looks great, the place is spacious and we were greeted and seated immediately. \n\nI ordered the cajun comb and my husband got the tilipia. While we're waiting for our meals to arrive our waiter offered us fresh baked bread right out of the oven. Not wanting to fill up on bread we declined. We're still sitting there when a roach scurries arcoss the ledge near our booth. ALL BUGS FREAK ME OUT!!!!!!! My husband said it wasn't that big a deal and I should just calm down. The table next to us received their food a couple of minutes before us, as soon as the waiter sat the food on the tray flies swarmed. I tried not to FREAK out but I was really getting uneasy about the safety of our food. Finally, our food comes out a couple of minutes later and I'm eyeballing it like a hawk.....no flies touched it, but it didn't stop them from trying to attack our food once it arrived. It's hard to enjoy your meal while you're swatting away flies and make sure roaches are coming up behind you. \n\nOn to the food, my fish was salty and my husband's was buttery. 2 perfectly good pieces of fish were ruined.\n\nWhile I went to the restroom my hubby ordered a slice of keylime pie for me. The pie was delicious, our waiter was great, the people watching is extremely interesting, but we will never return here."
1,"Hands down the best movie experience my wife and I have ever had.  Being able to pick your seats, have them recline and you then can relax.  Drinks that are also available (alcohol) makes it even better."
1,"Great atmosphere! Incredible bartenders. Always have great beers on draft, which are always changing. Make sure to check out  their menu. Great apps, pizzas and so many delicious rolls. Did I mention the bacons covered quesadillas? Definitely the go to spot in south side: never crazy but always a good crowd. Check out their specialty cocktails, you won't be disappointed. Awesome specials everyday. Half off apps on the daily. Kitchen's open til 1. If you're new to the areas or trying to avoid the big clubs, this is definitely the place to be at. Also a service industry hotspot for sure. Much love for Jay, Meg, Ryan, Mike and everyone else: so personable, so nice, always a good time!"
1,"Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service, clean place, and the noodles..."
1,"The premier place to see a hockey game. I loved every minute watching the Canadians against the Hurricanes. Great atmosphere, great fans. The only knock would be the concessions. Oh well. Oh, and beer is crazy expensive. We're talkin 10.50 a beer."
0,"I came with an Asian tour bus group and they had more than enough seating for 30 plus of us.  $12 for lunch buffet with very sparse selection.  I didn't try the Mongolian stir-fry.  Food was mediocre and I think they only served different variations of california roll.  \n\nVerdict - I was mildly satisfied and didn't get a stomachache, so I guess that's a win."
1,"Pros: convenient location, the trainers don't do unsolicited sells, the facility is relatively clean, the equipment is rarely broken, it has a pool, it's never packed to capacity and it's not clogged with fancy overwrought machines that look like torture devices.\n\nCons: Needs another squat rack & there's a 24 hour Roberto's in the same parking lot, argh."
0,I come here for the pancakes once a week and now they are gone. Bring them back please! #disappointed
1,"I love the all day happy hour on Sundays and Tuesdays, sushi can get so pricey, so to come here and have a reasonable bill and its yummy, is awesome. Plus being in Anthem, I always feels so limited on choices and this is a good one. \nWe ordered yellowtail, tuna, and salmon nigiri, tempura, edamame, and the Vegas roll and Philly roll. I read some other reviews that said the fish wasn't fresh, but that was not the case for us. Nor has it ever been any of the times I've been there. The nigiri was really good, and so was the tempura. The rolls weren't the best I've ever had but they were decent. Service was quick, and our server was super on top of things. \nOverall, I really like it and would not hesitate to return. I will stick with Sundays and Tuesdays because the prices were so good."
1,"So, now that the old timer glee club has abandoned this location, I can truly say that the relocation of this 'Bucks has become my favorite. Totally comfortable location, somewhat friendly associates, no fireplace anymore but I can overlook that. Lots of comfy leather chairs, you feel totally at home here. \n\nNormal coffee and tea menu, pastry case is always tempting and filled. Parking can be a hassle, but isn't that the case with any outdated strip malls in the Burgh?"
0,The service was awful we had to argue with the waitress to even split the check. everything is hella overpriced compared to how it is priced in the menu. This is exactly why I don't come to saddle ranch anymore. why pay outrageous prices for crap beer when I can pay the same amount and the beer is of much higher quality and more unique selection in downtown Glendale (OTG or Hause Murphy) or in downtown Phoenix (Angels Trumpet). At least at those establishments they are grateful for you spending your money at those bars.
0,Worst experencw of my life. Want to be lyed to sign up with direct tv
1,"Situated in a shopping center at the corner of Decatur Blvd and Spring Mountain Rd, it'd be impossible to drive by this place and not notice its entryway especially when lit at night.  Interior was nicely decorated with a fusion of traditional and modern Japanese elements throughout.  Music, on the other hand, can be overbearing as EDM blast through the speakers.  Nonetheless, ambiance is perfect for a date night or dinner with a group of friends.\n\nHaven't really considered of going back to any KBBQ joints since dining at this restaurant for the first time!  Consider it some sort of awakening due to the array of items one can enjoy in such great quality.  No AYCE here but they do offer different full course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 that can easily feed 2-4 people.  They also have Happy Hour specials from 1700-1830 and 2100-closing with several discounted items from the menu.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is how awesome their grills are.  Small vents actually surround the cooking area which makes the smoke dissipate before it can even engulf guests so they don't end up smelling like grilled meat afterwards.\n\nWe usually opt for their meat lover's course which is a great way to sample different cuts of meat in various marinades.  The meal starts out with miso soup and house salad as well cheese wontons and garlic fried chicken.  The spread is then followed by the main entree comprised with six different meat items.  To top it all off, s'mores to end the dinner; grill comes off so guests can toast marshmallows straight on the heat.\n\nOverall, Gyu-Kaku is definitely the better alternative to KBBQ...better yet, a great replacement if I must say.  Top notch food quality and superb customer service.  Can't wait for our next meal in this establishment!\n\nP.S. THEY SERVE LADY M MILLE CR\u00caPE CAKES!!  They only offer green tea flavor but oh so worth it!!"
0,"Seemed to only be concerned about the money. The front desk staff was surly and snotty and really couldn't be bothered to even be polite. They hide and then over charge. When the staff checked me in and when checked out they spoke to me very little just to each other, whining about having to work Saturday.  No call about the test like promised and their \""low cost spay and neuter\"" is almost 3x what other vets charge. And another  problem? Left me in waiting room that was not well organized for multiple animals but when finally got in the room? Vet had the worst hand shake of anyone I've met in years. It was like shaking a squishy dead fish. I won't ever be going back there. I'll just drive across town to see the vet I actually trust. Would NOT recommend! They also tried to hide how much the first set of puppy shots costs! Every other vet I called said between 20-35 for the first set. Them? $60! They are only about the money."
0,"Pathetic place, poor service and attitude of the owner. Definitely a place which one can give a miss"
0,"I loved this place, we get groupons and go.  The last time we went they changed the menu , downsized the portions.  Not worth the drive from Gilbert."
0,"Cacuts Jacks was closed for a while, but it is up and running once again.  Total dive bar in Ahwatukee, it is never my first choice, however a few of my friends love to go there for the cheap drinks and music (live or juke box).  I have never tried any thing to eat at Cactus Jacks, and I don't plan on it anytime soon.\n\nCacuts Jacks isn't really the kind of bar to start out the night, however we have been known to finish our night there, usually when Happy Hour at Brad's Places goes a little long, or when we're headed back to the tuke from some other event and don't want to stop the drinking fun!\n\nWhen we do end up going there, or even suggesting \""How about Cactus Jacks?\"", the rest of the group knows that the night just went from a rank of mild intoxication, to \""might as well call a cab now!\""  Crazy things have happened at Cactus Jacks, lots of good stories and foggy memories."
0,We will never take our dog here again! We scheduled an appointment and dropped her off on time. We called 2 1/2 hours later because we hadn't heard anything from them and we were told they had not even started yet! When she was finally done (4 hours after original appt.) the cut was FAR from worth the wait. The groomer was very rude and we didn't get any sort of apology for the wait. NEVER AGAIN!!
1,"How weird - yelp seems to have deleted my last review! Well here it is again with some more info.\n\nThis is the best nail salon I've been to - clean, affordable, and my manicure lasts 3-4 weeks! Make sure to ask them to use the gel so your mani/pedi last a long time. Diane and Ann do the best flowers and they can do the flower on your pedicure even if someone else is doing your pedicure. They do a great job of remembering what my preferences are and it's pretty much perfect every time.\n\nThey can get really busy on weekend afternoons so it's better to go a little earlier or to call for an appointment. See you there! :)"
0,WORST service I have ever experienced. I don't normally write reviews but the service was so bad I needed to let people know. Waiter never came to check on us and we had to leave after an hour of not getting our food.
1,"Aah may zing!!!! From the corn chowder to the biscuits to the ribs, mac n cheese & greens...I tried so much here that I'm a little embarrassed yet proud at the same time, and I loved it all. Service was great too! And whoever thought of that jalape\u00f1o tartar sauce needs to be kissed. Oh wait! Did I also mention the fried chicken w/ mashed potatoes & fabulous green beans? The grits & fried catfish were also great. I'm watching my figure so I only had the red velvet cake for dessert. It was the most moist cake I ever had."
1,The best place for a real manicure. And a fun place to spend part of your day.
1,"We were in town and needed to kill some time so thought we'd catch a movie.  I didn't know it was a grill/bar as well, it was just the closest theater according to Fandango.\n\nWe had a great time, the food was excellent and well-priced (for a theater), and the seats and service were great!  Glad we found that place, hopefully we can catch it again the next time we're in town.\n\nOnly downside was I thought the popcorn was actually a WORSE value than the normal theater. (If you can believe that)"
0,"I was stoked to finally try the much hyped Pinkberry. Paris Hilton likes it so it has to be good right? Well apparently no. I went this afternoon where it was insanely packed which I can handle but was expecting more of a selection flavor wise. I got the pomegranate fro yo topped with blackberries, kiwi and fruity pebbles and it was good but I've had better. I would rather go to Yoforia, mix and match and have it weighed. Also, I'm a pretty happy person however the happy happy joy joy act was a bit too sunshiney happiness up my butt for me personally. But then again, I was hungover so......\n\nIt wasn't horrible but definitely didn't live up to the hype. I would go again but definitely won't be having a Pinkberry craving anytime soon."
1,"This place is delicious!\n\nWe were here a week or so ago and had amazing service and fabulous food. We ordered one of the pizzas that is three pizzas in one (one long pizza). First it was tomatoes, mozzarella, some arugula and small pieces of Parmesan. Very good!  Up next was the two or three kinds of meat that was again amazing. The final one was Apple, walnuts, figs and Gorgonzola cheese with a Nutella drizzle. It was really good!  The crust was my favorite. Not crunchy but not super thick. \n\nI will be back and hopefully try everything on the menu!!"
0,"If you are searching for a Condo, find a Condo.. THESE ARE APARTMENTS!!  Not condos.  The speed bumps are horrible, parking is ridiculous.  And since they are privately owned, ANYONE and I mean ANYONE can move in.  Some of the loudest and rudest people.  And to get Security to get off their lazy bums is not going to happen. Unless they happen to be out on patrol.  Its a gated community yet cars are broken into, or spray painted on.  HOA is of no help either, not to mention if you end up buying be leary.. They allow HUD!  Which brings the property value down on your home.  But alas some of us are stuck here in the POINTS recreation.  Until we can get out of the screw ball of paying mortgage too high for an APARTMENT!  Its just not worth it."
1,"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. You MUST go for the teppanyaki and come hungry. Make a reservation with Tiger.  He's such a great guy and freaking hilarious! Go later and ask for the naughty show.  It's so much fun! We've been here multiple times with friends and guests visiting.  My favorite is the salmon.  Tiger always makes the salmon skin such a tasty, crunchy perfection. He makes tons of sauces right in front of your eyes.  The quality of the food is awesome.  It's so delicious!!"
0,"Out of all the Cirque du soleil shows I've seen either traveling or stages, this one by far has been the worse.  Although the acrobats and actors were great, the show overall was horrible. \n\nDo NOT spend the money to see this show.  There are now 21 shows worldwide and trust me, I've seen 12 of them in counting and this one is a good one to miss.  I would have rather played my money gambling at the casino for 2 hours with a chance of winning than watch this.  Sorry but this was a cirque miss for me."
0,"This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO."
0,"I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. \n\nBuffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.\n\nMy friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  \n\nI chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.\n\nI paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service."
0,"What a hot mess of a place. \nThe outside facade and the entry way are one design. Then you walk in to what reminds me of a college cafeteria- salsa bar, soda fountain, and random loud music blaring. And I mean RANDOM- from Ginuwine's Pony, to Coldplay, to Tejano. \nThe lines to order were a bit confusing for a first timer even with the signs. It was hard to hear the servers with the enormously deep counters. And the counters were so tall that I had to stand on my tippy toes and yell and point at the food that I wanted to order. \nThe bar is so tiny and it holds like 4 stools. Not a place to sit and unwind with your friends.\nThe total for my 2 gran tacos and a water was $12. Now that is not a good deal in my opinion. \nIt was just too much for too little. Not my ideal spot for a meal."
0,"Very disappointed in the delivery service. My friend and I ordered two salads for delivery, we were told that the delivery would arrive between 35 and 40 minutes. It did not arrive for an hour and a half! The delivery guy that showed up looked completely stoned, his eyes were bloodshot And super red. The salads themselves were sub par. We both paid an additional 2 dollars for grilled chicken and received 3 to 4 strips of chicken that looked and tasted like they were out of a can. Overall very unpleasant experience, I will not be placing a delivery with them ever again, and pretty sure I wouldn't even go for dine in."
1,"Clean, nice staff."
0,"I attended this even last year and had my gripes about organization and parking.  I had purchased VIP tickets.  Long lines were the norm but overall not bad. My tickets gave me some shaded seating, a bathroom, appetizers, 6 alcoholic drinks an free soda and water and $10 in food tickets. Overall a good experience. \n\nAgain this year I bought the VIP tickets and after reading that some things changed I anticipated being annoyed and disappointed- which happened. First, I was directed to park an obscene distance from the entrance even when the lot was not full on the north end. Easily 1/2 mile away from entrance.  I got right in however, but I arrived when it opened to try and beat some of the lines this year. \n\nVIP was not so much VIP however. They added more seating- out in the open sun and only a handful of standing tables under the shade.  Bathrooms were just port-a-potties with hand sanitizer- last year there were two portable bathrooms with running water. My 6 drinks now included soda and water, no more complimentary non alcoholic beverages. As for those alcoholic ones, pathetic. Last year a full bar was available along with beer and wine. This year? Select beers, wine, and premade cocktails in a bucket. IN A BUCKET. WTH? I'm not a college kid in rocky point for spring break.  Vodka lemonade and rum punch- poorly mixed to boot- are sad excuses for cocktails. \n\nNo appetizers were included this year and those $8 in food tickets? Well I used them in one fail swoop at Montana BBQ next door. The cost of food was ridiculous especially with the portions of some. I saw a few trucks like tom's bbq giving very shareable potions for $8-10 but I got about 6 cheese curds for $4 at another truck. \n\nI would like to note some great trucks though- Franks hot dogs and Chuckies topped it for me. Both excellent and worth the small wait. Sammich did it awesome too.  Didn't bother with the Maine Lobster Lady. $20 and over an hour wait for a sandwich was not cutting it. I'm sure it is excellent but that hour plus wait was just to order the thing... I am a huge truck foodie and visit them wherever I travel. I'm all good paying $10 for lunch anytime but this was a truck festival. Smaller portions for less money make it possible to try several trucks. Come early too since even the dessert trucks had super long lines by 2 pm. Making it miserable to stand in lines in the sun. \n\nI hop they make some changes for next year, especially with that VIP ticket. I feel completely ripped off on that purchase this year. The trucks will always get my business but it may not include this festival."
0,I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.
0,Never again worst experience ever very ghetto and in professional we paid for bottle service and once our bottle was done we was booted from our table  was told someone else had just brought the table smh but no other table got extra bottles are were forced to move from their table  then I got outside and s guy is in my car searching  how did he get in who know where was security  never again ppl make this ur last result  this place needs some improvement on services for sure  more a/c  and air freshener the club has a  funny smell to it
1,"I go to this place entirely because it is the best coffee in Pittsburgh.  Perfectly poured cups, reminiscent of Italy.  Even if the service was done by grouchy snobby hipsters I'd still come.  \n\nHowever, it is quite the opposite.  The owner, Matt, remembers my name and my drink every time.  He takes care with it, chats me up, and puts up with my pre-coffee incoherence.  \n\nI should also mention that I came here every day for a while, but have since moved.  I came back after two years - Matt, not missing a beat, asks if my drink has changed and asks me how Boston is.  \n\nPittsburghers, perfect quality AND friendliness does not exist outside of this city."
0,"Heard a lot of good things about Pete's. I am from the Gulf Coast and was not expecting to find anything that would compare to the delicious fried seafood of back home. Glad I set my expectations low.\n  Pete's fish is ok, square, almost like processed but not. Strange but tasty. Chips are decent, taste like typical Ore-Ida frozen fries. The Onion rings were good (super greasy though). My biggest problem is that I am a bit of a traditionalist. If you are gonna call it \""fish and chips\"" like they would in the UK, then you have to at least have malt vinegar. The red sauce is good with their fries and rings (and maybe shrimp) but not on fish. It is the only sauce they have. I hear the burgers are good and may go back, if I am already in the area, to try one. I wonder if they have mustard? They may be trying to do too many things at once here. Seafood, Americana, Mexican, (fish, shrimp, burritos, hot dogs, chicken, oysters) Just a thought.\n  The seating is outside, if its summer you must get it to go. Between the heat, pigeons and huge flies (serious kitchen hawks) you will not have a good time. \n  The prices are very reasonable but they only accept cash. I would not go out of my way to eat at Pete's again."
1,"Awesome drinks (wine and dessert sake) and great service! Pricey, but worth the treat!"
0,"I called in my order at 4:00 and they said it would be ready in 5 to 10 minutes.  I asked if I could pick it up at the drive thru and they said yes or that I could come in.  I waited at the drive thru for several minutes and finally backed up and parked my car only to come in and have someone assist other people but not me.  I saw a bag on the to go counter and asked if that was mine.  I waited 10 minutes and after that paid and got the bag only to find out that the fries were COLD.  I said I wanted warm fries which they said they would do, but then I thought that means that the burger and taco that I got would even be COLDER.  I will never go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I  have never been to a restaurant with better customer service.  The staff at this location are out of this world.  The food is amazing as well.  Everytime we go we have had delicous prime rib and sirloins.  Happy hour is a great time to test it out, but you wouldn't be disappointed for dinner.  We love going during the week on Monday or Tuesday when it isn't very busy."
1,"After some massive faff and having an appointment cancelled on me back in the UK, I had to find someone once I landed in Phoenix stat. Thanks to the Internet gods and Yelp I found Salon D'Shayn and Courtenay in Scottsdale. You know you're back in Scottsdale and been abroad too long when it makes you cringe to hear a girl talk about needing two engagement rings--one for going out, and one for every day.\n\nI've had some great waxes and not so great waxes across the US and in the UK... Courtenay is brilliant and a riot with her sense of humour (you need to with this job, eh?). She will sing to you (Norah Jones) and put you at ease. Although I prefer hot wax with my sensitive skin, the results with strip wax were flawless. Her technique was meticulous, which I totally appreciate. If I still lived in the Valley, I would definitely make her a staple in my beauty book.\n\nGood to know: 50% off for first time wax clients--score!"
0,"I'm rating this place with one star because I haven't even been there and already will never go there. This morning I called to ask about how much their oil changes are and this was my conversation with the worker:\n*Ring*\nWorker: e motors...\nMe: hi I just wanted to ask how much an oil change was,\nWorker: 19.99. After tax 22 (or 24, can't remember) .99\nMe: okay. Thank u\nWorker: yup *CLICK*\n\n\nSo rude. Not ever going there"
0,"I've never liked going here, pretty terrible food and service. I actually know some of the people who used to work here, and they aren't exactly in a clear mind when they clock in. Once there were gnats flying around my food, pretty off-putting. I wouldn't go here again unless i had to. If you do like the food and get past all the bad things, try the mother load. Least terrible thing on the menu- they pretty much just throw everything they can into that sandwich."
1,Great massage envy location. I had an excellent massage there with Ashley I believe was her name. The place is also very clean and the front desk is amply staffed to accommodate guests. Glad I was able to stop in on my visit to Tempe.
1,This food is amazing will definitely be back for some more. I had the chile Colorado burrito looked so good got right to it and forgot to take a picture.
0,Save your money and go somewhere else to shoot or buy a gun.\n\nI have been a member here and have shot here for years and have watched them slowly fill this range with every rude douche in Las Vegas. \n\nI brought the family here for some family range time and was belittled by the staff and watched them consistently interupt and belittle others in lanes next to ours. \n\nOn top on this the prices have gone through the roof. \n\nI will never return and most certainly never buy a firearm here.
1,"Love, this place. And the Sangria's are to die for. Sunday they have an awesome brunch and Sangria's are half off! The food is great for dinner and the bread they bring out at the begining with the dipping sauces...EVERYTHING IS GOOD!"
1,I love my daughter's coaches. Especially when they let me know she isn't doing what she's suppose to do.  My daughter has been doing gymnastics since 2 and this is my favorite spot so far.
1,"I am loving this place!  Both the owner and her mother have been very sweet and helpful.  Surprisingly, they have both talked me out of buying things that I thought i was interested in only to encourage me to get something that was more suitable to my need regardless of the cost. This has become my go-to local/independent shop for new baby gear. It would be great if they opened a resale shop too!"
1,"Even if you don't grab a bite to eat here, you should stop for the shakes.  Either with alcohol or without.  They have some damn fine shakes.  I loved the s'mores one.  ugh. omg. delicious."
0,"The Good- It is a new, clean, and attractive resort.  Very nice rooms with state of the art technology and services.  Location is also great as it is right in the center of the action of the LV Strip.\n\nThe Bad- Terrible food and restaurants.  Expensive compared to other new casinos/resorts that are in the same category.  Customer service is poor, they do not listen to you at all.  No reason to stay here when other 4/5 star hotels like The Cosmo, Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian, Wynn, and Encore are much better overall."
0,"In a nutshell: Go for the burgers, skip the salads. The service? Abysmal. Details.\n\nThe line to order at the register was short. The wait to order was looonnng. Definitely training needed there as when we placed our order the chick was confused. Benefit of the doubt...maybe it was her first day. One can only hope. \n\nThe food. My Buffalo Bleu Burger made me smile from ear to ear nit only because of the crusty grilled and browned griddled burger exterior, but they put it on a GLUTEN FREE BUN! I'll go back again and again for that burger!\n\nNow the downside of the food. The salads. If you like a giant bowl of greens and not much else, maybe you'll be a happy camper, but when you're paying for a salad with corn, black beans, avocado, tortilla strips and chicken you expect to be able to find them instead of playing hide and seek. \n\nAnd back to the service. The burger was delivered to our table first. And we waited a while for the salad. When it finally arrived, there was dressing all over when the dressing was supposed to be on the side. When pointed out, the waitress (who had been the same confused chick at the register) nearly slapped her own forehead as she said aloud, \""that's right!\"" She took it back as my burger continued to cool. Clueless Chick returned with the massive pile of lettuce and dressing the side. Yay her! But this time, although the aforesaid veggies were still playing hide and seek, the chicken was missing. Up to the salad assembly line went my dining companion and eventually returned with the missing chicken. Yes, my burger was cold...And so was the \""grilled\"" newly found chicken. And it was bland and tasteless. \n\nI finished my cold-by-then burger, Kimber picked a little, trying to eat the salad but left it mostly untouched. Go for the burger, skip the salads and PRAY for better service! Maybe better yet, skip this particular location completely and hope another location is better."
0,This place was good and I stop by while on business in town.  The varieties of oysters were great and the Bass was good. Service was a little slow and need more work.
1,"I like this place because you get your subs super fast and they're good for the most part too!\nI feel like the quality is better than Subway. I always order the Vito because I love Italian subs. However, if you want the meatier, thicker sub, I would go for the NightClub sub, because it's essentially the same, just with more meat and toppings. I've tried the tuna sub, which is good if you like classic tuna subs. Nothing special, just a good ol' tuna sub sandwich. I wouldn't go in with the expectations of classic Deli subs from New York/Chicago. If you want subs better than Subway though and want it done really quickly, then go here, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and one more thing... the sizes of the subs are all one length - longer than a 6 inch but not quite a foot long. \nI think the hype is all in the atmosphere. Being in Surprise, AZ which is on top of Sun City, I doubt the loud rock music flies well with some of the clientele. I even heard some of the customers complain that the music is too loud. The manager explained that part of the JJ's chain's personality is the loud rock music. It keeps the atmosphere light and upbeat, along with their funny signs, rules, and sayings. The workers behind the counter even yell out and greet you the second you open the doors to enter the restaurant. This place is just so convenient for what it is. It's easy to get to, plenty of parking, and they even deliver 1 sandwich if that's all you order. Overall, I can say that I really like this place, which explains why that the staff I work with hits this place up at least once a week."
0,If you have seen him in the past you will be very disappointed.  Way less magic and a lot of just going through the motions. He thought he was funny picking on guests but we were there for illusions not comedy that isn't really.  Seating was awful. We were crammed in the stage seemed cramped too. This was sad to see after him being such an icon to Las Vegas in the past but I think he is going to be upstaged by some of the newcomers to illusions
0,"The hostess in front was not at all friendly. She didn't even welcome us. Just asked for name and party. That was kind of a bad start... The wait was 50 minutes for Sunday at 12... We waited the 50 minutes Bc I had wanted to try this place for a while....we were seated in 53 mins. \n\nThe waitress Megan took 10 mins to greet us at our table ad she wasn't all that helpful. When I asked if the waffles were good and she replied, \""yeah.\""  Let me tell you after she too our order she did NOTHING for us. We actually ordered another side dish through another waiter.  \n\nThe busboy was great! Always filling up our water cups. We personally gave him cash tip and left our waitress with a 5% tip Bc again she did NOTHING. She didn't even serve our food get us condiments. NOTHING. \n\nMy husband got the ham steak which took 20 mins to rcv. I ordered the waffles and it took 30 mins. Again I ordered waffles- not chicken and waffles just waffles... 30 mins. \n\nThe male waiters were all very nice and attentive to us and our needs.. All of the women workers seemed to have a pretty large stick up their............ \n\nI will not return here again.. So disappointed in the upgraded ihop/Denny's food.  Not worth the wait, money or rude service. Blah!  \n\nThe service was so bad that my husband who never complains about anything, was even pissed and called the manager... He spoke with \""yushon?\"" And she offered to pay for our next meal which we all know is the restaurants way of saying \""shut your complaining\"""
0,"Just stopping by to review the super cheesey Sirens Pirate show at TI. It was silly, cheesey as previously stated, and weak. I mean, for a free show it was ok. I just wish we hadnt wasted good camcorder tape on it. Lol. The dialouge is awful about the sirens not wanting the pirates to steal their closet space and stuff... Didnt vibe with my feminist ideals, but once again, it was free. Fun show if youre right there in the area to watch it. I wouldnt schedule your whole night around it though."
0,"May be a decent place to eat hibachi...BUT NOT sushi or sashimi!!!!  I have tried Nakama's 3 times to be fair.  Nakama can not live up to it's name as a \""Sushi Bar\"".  Don't waste your time, money or taste buds...."
0,"I've been coming to this buffet before it was even called Flavors... Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.\n\nCame here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.\n\nI can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces. \n\nCouple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon \""sushi\"". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll. \n\nFor about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of \""ehh\"" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food. \n\nP.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor. There's a Ghirardelli shop a couple steps from the buffet that'll oversatisfy your taste buds for sure."
0,"Worst experience ever!!! Today was just horrible. We witnessed a bouncer belittle and be rude to so many people. The bar was packed, which was not bad but honestly most of the 'security' staff need to be fired if not arrested for harassing girls and just honestly being out of line with anyone who walked in the door or sat on the porch. I plan to go back but only to get things on video as we are almost sure the owner/ manager MUST NOT know this is happening. If they do.... The place needs to be shut down right away. All we wanted to do was watch the panthers game and yet we ended up so sad and disgraced by the actions of these people who work in Charlotte."
0,"Wow! Came here with family on a Monday night.  We sat on the patio and the view was great. . However that is where all the good ends.  We were a party of four and two kids and between us we ordered 4 meals.  We got two meals delivered and then nothing, the server just left.  Then, we got another meal, again with no explanation about where the last meal was.  After a few minutes of waiting,  the server stormed by in a rush to tell us that the flatbread was made incorrectly and that's what we were waiting on.  Meanwhile, I started to nibble on my chicken taco salad. ...and it was awful.  It was like canned chili meat thrown on  some spinach and  lettuce with an unappetizing blob of sour cream.  Missing the black olives the menu promised me, I thought I would ask for them.  When I did, the server literally turned and walked away from me before the sentence was out of my mouth.  Finally the flatbread came out, but it wasn't the made the way it was ordered.  When this was pointed out, the server actually said, well I didn't  hear you say that and whirled around with the food with no further explanation.  When it did  come back, the mushrooms had just been scraped off, which was not okay.  When told this, the server said, well what do you want me to do about it? \nWhen I tried to  speak to the manager, the server interrupted and said you can tell me.  When I started to explain why we were unhappy, she tried to make excuses about her other 3 tables she had to serve and finally cut me off saying I'll just get you another server and walked away.  \nI did explain the situation to the \""night manager\"" and she comped the terrible food and gave us a piece of cake.  Plus we did get a new server, who did much better.\nOverall, not a great experience and we won't be back."
1,"Too bad they decided to lower their prices. I think that may have put them out of business. We would have kept coming back at a higher price point and the naysayers and complainers looking for cheap meal would have stayed out.\n\n       \""  .  .  .  of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.\""\n                         Dennis Miller"
0,"I can't even give it a star. \n180.00 no adjustment, just videos, and a sales pitch. I'm canceling my payment for fraud via credit card. F this scamming bastage. I have ZERO good things to say about the 4000.00 plan that they wanted me to finance through GE capital. \nDo NOT go to this place. Unless you want to just throw away money."
1,"El Pastor is really great! The staff is friendly, the food is authentic and very well made, the portions are a good size, and price is certainly right. Compared to the late Taqueria Guadalajara, just down the street, it comes up a bit short with its ambience and charm, but it makes up for it with plenty of space, and everything else already mentioned. I've never been disappointed here with any menu item!"
0,"AWFUL!  The hub bub about the decor, well, it's cheap and trashy. The place REEKS of stale cigarette smoke (and this is coming from a smoker) that hits you like a ton of bricks the moment you walk in the door.\n\nOn a whim, we decided to try Bob's Garage for the first time on Saturday, July 13, 2013. The place was all but empty and no one greeted us or told us where to sit, we just kind of stood by the door waiting to get noticed before finally choosing a table on our own. No verbal greeting or acknowledgment of any kind as we stood there. Ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions. I suddenly felt ill (didn't know at the time, but it was a sudden attack of vertigo), alas, I digress. I felt as if I were going to pass out. Sent one of my companions to get me some water. The waitress came over and said \""Oh, I would have gotten that for you\"" in a very snotty tone, as if we breached some etiquette by NOT asking her for it when she was clearly not attentive. We ordered cheese sticks in case it was low blood sugar, but it was not. They were frozen and certainly not worth the price. The waitress could tell I was having some sort of issue and brought our check over \""in case you need to leave suddenly\""...REALLY? She never asked if I was okay, needed her to call someone, needed help or anything, but was more worried about collecting the bill than a customer's well-being. I will NEVER go back there again. Oh, by the way, 2 draught beers, 1 glass of wine (that I did not even sip) and an order of cheese sticks (frozen and not very good) was almost $22, what a rip off!"

1,"HUGE portions and great dishes.\nSo far, we have tried their crepes, a few omelettes, the Dutch baby, etc.\nService is always nice, but they do tend to get VERY busy on weekend mornings at this location (Fort Apache) So either get there early, or expect a wait.\n\nCons: A little pricier than the average breakfast fare, but it is understandable with the huge portions they give you.  MY wife and I can barely get halfway through each dish that we have ordered.\nBut, contrary to the huge portions, they discourage sharing by charging the second person almost full-price if you do share.  I don't see too many restaurants doing this nowadays and it just seems like a real nickle and dime tactic to save a buck.   \n\nAll in all though, that shouldn't really discourage anyone from trying this great restaurant out.  Try the buckwheat pancakes!"
1,"One of the best take-out meals I've ever had. A group of us shared #31 Larp (with pork), #11 Kang Gai soup (w/chicken), #28 Mango Curry (w/ tofu), #19 Phra Lam Durn Don (w/chicken), and the Spring Rolls (both shrimp and tofu). We had the \""timid\"" spice level for everything except the soup, which was \""careful.\"" The soup and Phra Lam were so very, very good. I could go for a big bowl of their peanut sauce right now. The curry was also great. The spring rolls were fine - we all liked the shrimp variety better than the tofu. The Larp dish was the only one we didn't finish (and lick the container) - too much ginger for my taste. Not terrible, but not nearly as good as the other dishes. I can't wait to return to Lao Laan-Xang!"
0,I'm from Ohio and I had a dodge pickup I rented from dollar rent a car and we we\nnt here to get gas after going to lake mead heading back to MGM grand and so we pulled into this place and went to a pump and I got out and got my chevron credit card out and started to insert my card till I seen a sign all payments must be made with cashier and so I went inside and told the cashier I need gas on pump 5 and she say ok and she said its ready and come back for a reciept and so I went back outside and I picked up the regular gas pump nozzle and it wouldn't pump no gas and so I went back and she said she activated pump 5 supreme and I said no I only wanted regular and she said oh you have to get the pump number on top of the regular pump and so I said well that's a little odd and wield and she states its just because we have older pumps and I said I'll just go down the street to a different station and told her to cancel my transaction.\n\n\n\nBEWARE THEY HAVE 1980's GAS PUMPS THAT DOES NOT HAVE CREDIT CARD MACHINES.
0,"I used this airline due to the fares and the fact that it was non stop to Philadelphia. Upon first arriving they are telling us to check in which I had already done at home. I ask why do it at home, to have to do it again at both airports. I just do not even understand the point of this. We get through the check in and TSA in Vegas without too much of a problem. The comes boarding, we are zone 4 so we are the last to board. We get to our seats and there is barely leg room. This is honestly the worst I have seen as far as leg room goes. So we crawl into our seats, mind you it is the red eye. We take off the seat belt sign goes off, we can now recline and sleep. To forget this is no leg room. Well the seats do not recline either. No one around us could recline. And we were not sitting in the exit row. For 4 and half hours we were sitting straight up, and could not move our legs. This can not possibly be healthy. \nOur luggage came out quickly which was great as we were dead tired.\n\nOur return trip was not pleasant upon check in. Not one person at the check in at Philadelphia airport was helpful. It was a serious cluster fuck. Everyone trying to get an agent's attention. \nThe plane was smaller which was great, as it gave us a normal amount of leg room. The seats also reclined. \nI will honestly never fly this airline again. I wish Jet Blue or Virgin would fly non stop to Philadelphia."

0,"Reminded today of what terrible experience was... got notification of the bill :-).  Apparently, billing is slow, too.  Right on their statement, it shows my insurance paid on 10/20.  I got the bill this morning (12/17).  \n\n$105 for a 10 minute visit with a PA and a simple urinalysis...  My share is apparently $48.   Even that small amount makes me feel ripped for the complete lack of care.   \n\nFortunately, it did prompt me to find another practice - ironically in the same complex - at Grayhawk Medical who have turned out to be great."
0,I probably didn't pick the right item...  I got the gyro and wasn't impressed.  The only thing impressive was the size.  It was sadly very lacking in flavor. \n\nExtra star for the fact that I had their roast beef sandwich as an Ironman Arizona volunteer and that one was good. But nothing I would write home about.
0,"It took a very long time for the meals to be served. Also, the food is not worth the price IMO."
1,"I saw a few reviews on this place and decided to check it out. I had no idea it was so close to us and right next to the Von's I frequent. Not sure how I overlooked this place.\n\nI'm originally from northern Illinois, about 90 miles outside of Chicago. My wife had never been to Illinois until a couple of years ago. While there we went to Taste of Chicago where she had her first Chicago dog and immediately fell in love.\n\nWe have been to Windy City twice in the past two weeks since discovering it. The second time we invited my parents who also were in search of a little taste of home.\n\nThe first time we went, my wife got the Chicago dogs and a Green River (limey ginger ale soda). I got the Italian sausage and a pizza puff. I'm not  a big fan of hot dogs, but my wife confirmed they were solid reproductions of authentic Chicago dogs. The Italian sausage was decent. I had never had a pizza puff before and am now a fan. My wife's meal came with fries which were really good, nice and thin and crispy. Just the way I like them.\n\nThe second time we went my wife again got a Chicago dog. I got an Italian beef sandwich. I don't think I'd ever had an Italian beef sandwich before. I got mine dipped with cheese, peppers, and giardinera. I liked mine a lot. I think I'll get that again. I might get it wet though, which ironically is drier than the dipped. The dipped was really good but the sogginess made it difficult to eat."
0,"Sat outside to grab a drink with a friend on a Friday evening. The hostess seemed scatterbrained and nervous, as if she was new, but she made us feel kind of uneasy and sat us at a dirty table. A female server came over and wiped down the table after we asked, but sprayed us and some of the table scraps got flung on us as well - yuck! \n\nI'll probably go elsewhere next time, but their cucumber gin drink was pretty good."
0,"We came in for a quick bite to eat before leaving Vegas sat outside and ordered a strawberry Margarita, it was so sweet you can barely drink it.\nWe also ordered the nachos and chicken wings the nachos were very good I font know about the chicken wings cause my wife had one wing and noticed a hair in her plate and lost her appetite we sent it back they were kind enough to take it off our bill needless to say it was not the Mexican food we are used to here in southern Cali would I go back to Vegas of corse to wabo Cabo don't think so"
1,"Ya this stuff is pretty dangerous...\n\nLocated at the very end of the Caesars Forum shops is this hole in the wall. It was a school night and he wanted a drink.\n\nThey give you up to 2 samples so you can try various flavors and you can mix/match. The cups/glasses were kinda $$$, but if you tend to drink a lot (or share) and get multiple refills, then this is a bargain.\n\nYou can slurp this stuff down like a slushy!!!\n\nDrinking on a school night?!\n\nThat = TROUBLE..."
1,A great job at a fair price!  Mark even passed up dessert with his family to come back out and do an extra enzyme treatment while the carpet was still wet.  You don't get customer service like this anymore!

1,What a great experience trying modern Vietnamese food! So here's my reviews on the dishes:\n\n*Oxtail fried rice was perfect! There was a good amount of meat.They give you a good portion to share with at least 3 people. \n\n*Yellowtail tacos were delish! They tasted like ceviche fish tacos. I just think they were a little small for $6 for two tacos.\n\n*Sea Snails were okay. They gave you at least 10 and they're the big sea snails too. I just thought they needed more seasonings.\n\n*Pork Buns weren't that good. It was kinda dry and the meat was small. I wouldn't order it again. \n\nAdrienne was our server and she was great and attentive! I would come back here and\ntry their pho!
0,"Was here yesterday and the service was beyond slow... my food order was wrong.... TWICE! The girl that took my order was nice, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place. The food was.... forgettable...  I would've been better off going to McDonalds and saving myself a couple bucks. The service and the food is just not worth it."
1,"The food was great!  The restaurant is not.  The service was so slow it was almost comical. At one point, the waitress acknowledged that we had nothing to drink but it was still another five minutes before someone actually brought us a refill. While there, I saw a guy standing and waiting to pay for a full five minutes or more, hoping to avoid that, I made sure to get up when she was paying attention, but she sat down with another table and spoke to them about the menu for quite a while.  Their service was probably awesome.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is non-smoking, but is connected to a bar that allows smoking, so it's still pretty smokey.\n\nOverall, I would definitely eat the food again, I would probably just order it to go."
0,"Service started out good,  then went downhill.  Nails were messed up and had to have her go back and fix them. Every two weeks when I came in to get a fill I was charged more and more.  Kind of ridiculous."
0,We were flooded and had to wash lots of items. It costed us about 49.00 dollars in 2 days wash. We had been going there consistently for 3 years. The owner came over and told that she was getting lots if complaints about our small service animal. Let tell all our little lady did was sit on her pilliw. The other patrons wanted to bring their dogs.  When we offered to show the papers the owner ignored. We continued to come even if the dryers didn't dry quickly.   We  came in weekly for 3 years and she never say hello or thank you for coming.  Why this time would she take the time to embrace us in front of the other people.   I wouldn't recommend this placed it's not friendly and you don't feel welcone. By the way it is illegal to question a person's special needs.
0,I can only give it to stars .I was so disappointed we ordered sandwiches for delivery they were very nice and the delivery man was very friendly and they were fast. The bread was horrible .my last time ordering from there .

1,"Beachy vibes and good burgers (including turkey and veggie menu options). The staff here (especially the waitresses) are incredibly personable and witty.  Would definitely recommend this place. Awesome service! Stop by if you're walking through Old-Town, and visit often.  We need cute, and fun places to stay downtown.  \n\nAnd they have a patio!  Would be perfect to come here during the evening to have a few beers and hang out."
0,"It's a really good concept but the execution in authentic flavors for each region falls a little short.  Every dish we tried was a bit off.  We had the Indian Butter Chicken, Thai Lemongrass Curry, Samosas (that was probably the best item) and some weird Korean Firecracker Riceball.  (I'm Korean and my Eomma would be like \""what the truck is this?\"")  Kind of reminds me of Trader Joe ethnic food but if you like the real, authentic deal then this place is probably not your speed."

0,"F*ck this place. Maybe the location in Tempe is better. First of all, just because I'm not dressed like a hippie/pothead doesn't mean I'm not one and shouldn't be treated differently. And just because you have dreds, tattoos, piercings and wear a bob marley shirt doesn't make you a true hippie. The help sucked major ass. They were all stuck up in their little hippie fantasy role thinking they are just so cool. I had my daughters with me and they were not kid friendly! We had to use the bathroom, there was no toilet paper. I had to ask and they bitched about that. \""Are you sure?\"" No, why would I make that up? Then I order the magic mushroom pinner. She asked me what I wanted on it and then didn't even listen to me, I had to keep repeating myself. When I took a bite, it was so salty I almost had a heart attack! She said teryaki sauce came with it. You don't have to drench it with sauce, whore! So I asked for my money back just on that sub, not the drinks and not the other sub. They had a fit! \""Well, we'll only refund you half  because you ate half of it!\"" I showed her I took two mfing bites!!! So, they reluctantly gave me $6 back. I tipped them $1 just to show I'm not the one that was the asshole. But as I drove away, I flipped them off hoping that they saw me. Remember my face, bitches!"
1,This is the best place in town hands down ..
0,"Don't come here if you have any sort of time constraints. The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because I didn't actually get to taste the food. I came here for lunch knowing that there would probably be a wait. But, I was craving some chicago style pizza, and I had an hour so I thought I'd be fine.\n\nI walk in and stare at the 2 workers in the place for 5 minutes. Finally he asks \""Can I help you?\"" Something about the way he said it just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt like he thought I was intruding upon his precious time. Granted, the restaurant was pretty full, and they seemed understaffed so I just asked for a table. He told me to \""sit tight\"", which I did. I sat tight for at least 15 minutes without anyone paying any more attention to me. An update on time would have been really nice. Even just saying a word to remind me that I hadn't become invisible would have been appreciated. Of course they were too busy running past me to say anything though. After wasting 20 minutes of my lunch break, I gave up and left.\n\nHopefully I can come back and actually try the food. But, the service here is really poor from what I can tell. The pizza better be amazing; otherwise, I don't think I'll be tempted to come back here."

0,"What seemed like a tiny, but convenient gym for us turned out to be a big disappointment. Like many other franchise gyms, the object is to sell training and supplements. They originally offered Zumba and yoga classes, but the facility is too small and due to  the multi-purpose use of the space, they are unable to maintain its cleanliness. The extra classes are no longer offered.The staff seems very focused on clients who want to purchase training sessions. The equipment is crowded into a small space that becomes way too busy when there are more than 8-10 people there. It all started out good when they wanted membership, but the atmosphere seems to have succumbed to disorganization and frenzy on the part of the management. Membership is cheap, and perks are few.....to be expected. Other Anytime Fitness franchises are much larger and offer (for fee) classes and services that complement the \""trainer\"" mentality of this gym."

0,"This place deserves zero stars. Full on scam tactics here. Selling things to you that you don't need and telling you things need to be replaced that don't.

Everything you will be told here is a complete lie. This place should be shut down and investigated."

My daughter's confidence was destroyed and it took almost 6 months to rebuild her self-esteem (new coaches have worked hard to turn her around).  My son got burnt out with the intensity of the mens coach (he's 10).  Luckily, both kids are in good spots now.  Don't go here.  There are many other gyms in the valley and yes, the facilities are beautiful but not worth the toll on your kids' psyche."

We spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didn't get a chance to see much of the Science Center, thankfully I was with good company."
0,This place lacks everything.. The food is disgusting. I threw up after I ate there food. It's just not good. It's sucks because Arizona lacks culture foods. Id rather go to Panda Express than step foot in that place.
0,"We arrived at Portlands, hungry after checking out several other downtown spots and finding them lifeless. \n\nPortlands looked great from the outside, especially after the 'vacant lot' surroundings of other downtown spots.  We walked into Portlands, finding it near-deserted, and ICY cold - on a lovely warm summer's evening!  So we asked to be seated outside; the host told us to seat ourselves outside, which we did.  \n\nWe waited a LONG time for a server - we were thirsty and hungry, and still had not been given menus or water.  There was only one other table occupied inside, and a few folks at the bar ... so we could not understand the delay.  Finally, a waiter arrived, handed us menus, and proceeded to explain some complicated arrangement along the lines of ...\"" the outside is really closed, but I will give you menus, and then you can come inside ... \"" ... I was so angry, I got up and walked out.  My partner explained that maybe they just wanted to come inside to order - that we would be served the food outside; but I didn't interpret what she said that way ... but anyway - the place was EMPTY, so a) why was it an ice-box, and b) why could we not sit where we wanted? Was it too far for the waiter to walk outside ...? \n\nI'm really trying to give the downtown restaurants a chance in Phoenix, but - after this we jumped in our car and drove to downtown Scottsdale where we found a lively bar/restaurant and had a great meal.  I really wish this place well - but I doubt I'll be returning.\n\nAnd PLEASE - all restaurants take note - not many people want to sit in 60-degree air when it is a near-perfect 85 outside!  I figure the A/C thermostat is set by some waiter who is hot from running in and out of the kitchen ... we diners aren't looking for an arctic experience!"
1,"For airport sushi, I can't complain!  The fish was seemingly fresh, though I did see the chef thawing out one huge piece of salmon in the sink...but hey, you are in a airport--did you expect the captain of the boat to turn up with an ice chest?\n\nThe service was great and the wine pours might have actually been bigger than the ones I pour at home (ok, that's probably unlikely but you get my drift).\n\nNext time I'm lingering around Charlotte Douglass International Airport, I'll know where to go for a healthy, yummy meal!"
0,"I'll get some flack for this one, but AJ Bombers is not the bomb. There, I said it.\n\nFor a burger place I found the menu limiting and uninspired. It's sort of cool that you get a dry erase maker to chart out your eats on their rewritable menu, but that and great service is about all these guys got. And the service is truly great. (More on that in a second.)\n\nPatties are expensive once you start adding ingredients like avocado and mushrooms (not really premiums in my book) and tacking on another 3.50 for grass-fed meat should make for somethin' spectacular, but mine left me wanting more. Nearing 13 bucks for beef these things should come with a side, but they don't and I was thrilled that we split sweet potato chips to start or I would have been starving after. \n\nA few suggestions that I think would help, and I'm only offering these because I really liked the staff and I would love to see these guys kill it! \n\n1. Ditch the servers, have people order at a counter using those same menu things and dry erase pens and let food runners flit around dropping burgers here there and everywhere. Water and soft drinks could be self service and a bartender could pop bottles or top off taps. \n\n2. Clean up the protein options and ditch the lame beef: grassfed beef only, turkey, soy, salmon and chicken. (Yeah, I said salmon burger baby)\n\n3. Expand the menu with 3 categories. Simply - Signature - Say What? Examples: \n\nSimple\nmeat/bun\n\nSignature\nMediterranean (meat, feta, olive tapenade, pita)\nand so on...\n\nSay What?\nThe Elvis (meat, peanut butter, bacon, banana spread)\nMac Attack (meat, macaroni and cheese, fried onion strings)\nand so on...\n\nI'm willing to check 'em out again though. They're super plugged into social media and  idigthat[dot]com."
1,"Love it! Great burgers and fries, they also serve coke products, a big plus! Great atmosphere and all the toppings u could want. No negatives I could find. Yummy."
0,"Please please don't order for delivery. It's been an hour and a half and the place doesn't even answer their phone. Can't review the food cause I have no idea where it is. Why didn't I just listen to the reviews!? I hate to see small business restaurants struggle, but this place does itself no favors."
0,"Wow... We didn't think a sandwich could be this pitiful. Somehow, these funny named little fellas found a way!  Tasteless \""French\"" bread combined with scant meat and scarcely any toppings makes for an unhappy patron.  The only minor bright spot in the meal was the soup, but then again, when you pay close to $13.00 for a wich combo, cup of soup and a drink, you certainly expect something better!  We would say that this is mostly on par with Subway only for half the amount of food and almost twice the cost.  We certainly wish Erbert & Gerbert's all the best and hope our experience was just an opening day fluke! These new 5 star reviews seem totally contrived, but we'll be back in about a month or two to check and see."
0,Just barely ok.  Below average free wine.  Food looks like mass prepared in mess hall. It's ok but but not wonderfully by any stretch.   Pretty pricey for what it is - IMO.  I wouldn't go back nor recommend to any of my friends. Expected so much better.
1,"Great food, kinda pricey but large portions. Worth it. Atmosphere is country and comfortable. Def coming back. Staff was friendly and plentiful with the coffee. Never rushed us once. There county potatoes are mmmmmmmmmmmm"
1,This is a great place to bring the family. I must admit they do have the best wings around. the pizza was fresh and top notch. And don't forget to finish the meal with a cannoli
0,"I love Paradise Bakery, just not this one. On too many occasions have they messed up my order or not had key ingredients for main sandwhiches. I keep returning based on convenient location to my home but no more. \n\nSave your money for another location or different restaurant."
0,Found a shard of glass the size of a silver dollar in the bottom of my glass.  The manager took $3.50 off of our bill. I've never been so shocked by such terrible customer service
1,"Best service in Scottsdale! I absolutely recommend Cake. Coming from a smaller city, my mind has been blown! From the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out, you will be raging. Great looking staff, also.. :)"
0,"Too expensive, kind of plan, not enough portion for the price and not authentic asian food! \n\nThe only thing I like about PF Chang is their drink menus. Otherwise service kind of sucks and so does the food. They are super busy also; so be prepare to wait to eat overly price food. \n\nI heard the PF Chang is a lot better in the South Park area, but having the experience I did at this PF Chang I don't think I want to waste my time again."
1,"If you are looking for an ugly sweater for the ugly sweater Christmas party, you are bound to find them here for sure.  It's too funny how some of these still exist. I was expecting to hold my breath to avoid the funky air smell in stores like these.  \n\nOn this visit though I was surprised that this thrift store was pretty clean and didnt have that musty smell when you walk in.  All the merchandise was cleaned up.  If you are looking for something in particular you dont have to dig your way through. Merchandise is organized categorized into sections. The clothes are sized and even sectioned off down into seasons. Don't expect to find the latest trends in fashion though, alot, about 80% of the stuff are so 3 years ago and beyond. Lots of rows of clothes to pour over though.  My good find was a vintage Levi jacket in great condition for $7!\n   \nThe housewares section had alot of funky junk. Even in fair condition was a little overpriced for being used. I cant justify paying full retail price for holiday placemats when you can probably find them 3 doors down at Big Lots and it's brand new. The store is a good place to find and repurpose items for cheap. I got creative and bought this hideous party dress for five bucks,cut out the crystal appliques out of it and used them. If I had gone to the craft or fabric stores, they would've cost me at least $5 a piece.  So this place is cool for what it is. It serves it's purpose for me."
0,Don't believe their posted hours. We got there 30 min before closing and we're sent away. Very annoying.
1,Consistently good contemporary thai. Order in or get it to go. Favorites are the Noodle Hut Special spicy tom yum soup that I order w both chicken AND shrimp and the Glass Noodle Salad in that yummy lemon-lime sauce. \n\nEverything is fresh and made to order. Nice selection of hot teas too.\n\n The summer rolls are not very flavorful though - basically just bland vermicelli w a lot of lettuce and a hunk of shrimp in the Shrimp version. \n\nKids love chicken on a stick w/ side of white rice. Super nice wait staff too. Bathroom is tiny and clean.
1,"We have been here many times over the years.  I say, go for the baked potato with truffles ... it is what dreams are made of!\n\nThree of us went here Wednesday night for a fantastic meal.  We opted for a few appetizers and several sides to accompany our NY steak.\n\nEverything was cooked to perfection and very tasty.  We received superb wine and wine service from Scott and his crew.  We were very pleased.\n\nWhen my 5-year old asked for something special ... they accommodated her every wish.  That is what very nice restaurants are made for! (B&B take a lesson here).\n\nThank you Charlie Palmer and your amazing team for a great evening and an amazing meal.  We will be back again and again."
1,"I was alone and hungry one day and I decided to stop by Miko's to eat for the very first time. I just wanted to try it out, no expectations. I ordered their spicy yellowtail bowl (sushi bowls are usually my measuring sticks for rating Japanese places). I was blown away. The sushi cuts were bright, fresh, and wholesome and the rice was prepared in a special way, having a unique taste to it. And it was all presented in a beautiful bowl. I then noticed the entire staff was Japanese. From this first experience, I knew this place was different.  \n\nI've been to many Japanese places around town over the years, and Miko's stands out. All other Japanese places seemed to be just carbon copies of each other, and they lack some kind of labor of love that Miko's has. They aim to be a comfortable local place with quality food that is fresh and authentic. The tuna is dark crimson RED, not disgustingly pink like in most sushi places. They have a chef's special menu that changes periodically (the seasonal oysters were amazing, and I hate oysters). There's even a vegetarian menu. Greg, the owner, makes sure that they serve the best of everything in reasonable amounts and prices, from sake to ice cream. I always admired the modest passion for detail and quality in this place.\n\nFrom the presentation to the taste, to the wonderful personalities of Greg and Miko, this place has become a common stomping ground for me for the past year. I've come to know them well now, and I believe their passion for their business shows in their food as well as in their personalities. It's difficult for me to go to other Japanese places because Miko's set the bar quite high. I've been recommending this place to others over time, and will continue to do so."
1,"If you've ever been to a Sam's Club (and I was a member a few years back), then the experience at a BJ's will be the same. Gigantic big box store (larger than your typical Wal-Mart) with high bay racks of storage that go all the way up to the ceiling.\n\nBJ's is a membership store and while you can do a trial shop (15% surcharge), you're better off simply joining for $50 a year. Yes, the do have specials and discounts but those are not year round.\n\nAs for the stuff, well, there's nearly everything. You might not be able to do a full grocery shop but you can certainly buy up a cartloads worth of stuff and in the process save some money on the bulk. Two-packs of some things seemed to be maybe half-again the price of buying one at Harris Teeter. Others are competitive with what you might find at Wal-Mart.\n\nI was impressed with the decent selection of pet food products, including a 50 pound bag of the same dog food I usually get at Petsmart but $10 cheaper.\n\nSo yes, I joined. And I'll be back.\n\nThe gas is cheaper than others nearby but it's still more expensive than going to South Carolina."
1,"I cannot say anything about the price since we did not pay for the nights we were there, its my best friends timeshare.  I thought our room was excellent.  we were in the back corner - I can't remember which tower but we loved it.  The room was beautiful and very updated.  Also close to all the major hotels.  I recommend this place highly."
0,"Slowest Starbucks ever!!! Excuses galore and a snarky window person equals one VERY unhappy customer!!! The window person even told me sarcastically \""thank you for your patience\"" after I has commented on how much time it was taking this morning!!! She rang up the wrong amount, handed me the wrong order and seemed frustrated with ME after I had spent 10 minutes stuck in that line!!! If there had been room for me to skip that line I would have been GONE!! I bit my tongue... Called the manager later and explained that maybe that employee needed extra training regarding her customer service!! Grrrr!!!!!"
1,"I have been to Richardson's many times and it still remains one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  For the people complaining about the food being spicy, um, it is a restaurant serving New Mexico cuisine - it is supposed to be spicy.  My favorite dish has to be the Relleno Platter.  I usually split it with a friend because the portion is huge: two rellenos with rice and beans.  I especially like the pork rellenos with verde sauce, but there's also smoked turkey, beef and regular cheese.  Their margaritas are outstanding...honestly, I haven't had anything that was bad at this restaurant.  And the wait staff is friendly, too.  \n\nI love their patio renovation.  It is stylish and sophisticated with a modern New Mexico ambiance.  Great for having dinner and/or drinks outdoors on one of our beautiful Phoenix evenings."
0,"After a half day of non stop eating, stopped for lunch at 521 BBQ, a second location of the flagship eatery located in a shopping mall. Nice outside seating, busy servers, and a good menu, where adults can thankfully order off the kid's menu. Ordered kid - sized rib plate, which consisted of 4 meaty,  well sauced and nicely charred ribs, smoked over hardwood pellets over a gas flame for 12 hours. They were tasty, although I really felt like there was not enough smokiness for my taste. Best hush puppies I have had out of the 3 bbq joints in NC we have visited thus far. Crispy on the outside without any trace of grease, and a perfect balance of moist and flaky inside. The beans were underwhelming,  tasted saucy, as my daughter assesed \""they would be good on a hot dog.\"" They had a unique red coleslaw, which our waitress explained was made with a ketchup vinegar base, which wasn't bad, but not anything I would go out of the way to have again. But oh, those hush puppies...they just might!"
1,"I have been coming to this place since college (a long time).  They do the best gel manicure.  I have had my gels on for 3 weeks and NO chips.  Pedicures are a little piece of heaven with their foot massages they are longer and it's actually a massage vs. getting lotion rubbed into your legs.  \nAlso, I always just walk in and have never waited more than 2 minutes!!"
1,"I'm so happy to finally have found a property in Vegas that I know my company will be using again, again, and again. The M is brand spanking new -- only opened a little over two months ago -- but wow, are they starting off strong! \n\nIt's a beautiful resort with the most amazing staff ever, incredible catering, and all the luxuries of the Strip without actually being in the middle of all the filth. The M is about a 15 minute drive from the Strip, right down Las Vegas Blvd. They offer an hourly shuttle so you can go get your fix and retreat. \n\nI loved the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows in our room that showed the lit up view of the Strip from a distance and the M's killer pool. They have a big stage overlooking the pool area for concerts, and we lucked out to catch a reggae show there one night.\n\nCan I say just one more time how much I loooooved the staff at this place? Don't let the front desk people deter you (they're still working on stepping up their game), every single person in this hotel will do backflips to make sure you're having the best time ever. \n\nHighly recommend checking out: the pool, casino (great raffle giveaways!! they were giving out Lexuses last week!), the ginormous buffet at Studio B, the luxurious spa, and the super cool wine tasting bar. Oh yeah, and their room service is delish & inexpensive. Couldn't be better!!"
1,"Am I tight w/my money? Yes. Yes, I am at times. Where do I go to stretch my money the most? Dollar Tree.\n\nWhy? Because everything is $1.00. But, you do have to be smart too. I've seen name brand hand soap in there for $1, but have seen this same brand at WalMart for 87 cents. So, I do believe that there is some trickery going on here.\n\nI can buy 24-count Tylenol PM (well, generic Canadian stuff) here as well as Christmas wrapping paper, bows, nametags, etc. All for one dollar, folks. I would have probably paid double if not triple at Target or Walmart for this sort of stuff.\n\nSome of their shelf-stable food scares me a little. I see lots of dented/bent stuff made in China that has labels in . Just be careful as you may end up w/a case of botulism."
0,"OK. Maybe I went on a no-name DJ day and maybe I didn't get bottle service for this club, but MAN the layout is horrible.\n\nBuy Pre-Sales (guys). Line was short and had no trouble getting in. \n\nFirst off, the layout of the club is super sick! I love walking in to the LED lights. The big LED screens near the DJ is stunning. The performers are amazing. BUT why is it bad?\n\nYou need bottles. It's not like XS/Marquee where you can just have fun without bottles. This place is strictly bottle friendly. The dance floor can be super packed. There are two bars which aren't that bad to get drinks. \n\nWhat turned me off was that we couldn't go upstairs. The bouncer said it was strictly for people with bottles only. So my friend and I just said we had it and got up there. Yes, there was a lot of space, but no way you can just socialize out of nowhere. \n\nI hated the layout and it was just not fun. \n\nMaybe I'll come back and get bottles. Maybe my review will be different. But for now, I hated it."
0,"We wanted a quick lunch, and decided to stop here. Good lord, it was expensive and crappy. The reheated slice of pizza was almost $8, and the plain hotdogs were $7. Belch. And the tables were so close together, it was impossible to move. Just go somewhere else."
1,"I have NEVER had a bad meal here! Amazing food, wine list and overall a great little gem in Cave Creek. My husband and I frequent this place for dinner (the tenderloin trio is amazing) and I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a fantastic meal. It's also very romantic in the winter, cozy with a nice fireplace!"
1,Good company. Fair prices and quality work. Enough said!
0,"We won't stay here again.\n\nTo be fair, when we arrived, things looked promising.  The gentleman at the front desk was friendly and helpful and put us on the 55th floor, which had a great view.  When we walked into the room, the window shades somehow knew we were there and raised on their own.  I thought that was pretty cool and was in the mood to like this place.  The room had a really nice look.\n\nBut then we tried to go to bed.  \n\nFirst, they don't have comfy hotel beds.  The beds were as hard as rocks.  And the pillows are so cheap and uncomfortable, my neck was actually sore the next day.  Bed = a cheap roadside motel. I called housekeeping to see if they had another pillow option (which it said they did in their little guide) and was told that they did not have anything else.  She kind of snapped the answer without checking, so I'm guessing she gets this a lot. \n\nBut the real problem was the thin walls.  I've never stayed in a hotel with such crappy construction.  Did they not realize that in Vegas, some people might want to party and other people might want to relax?  The first night, we heard squealing girls through the connecting door and just decided we should try to stay out late enough and hope they were passed out when we got home.  But the second night, we were tired, my guy wasn't feeling well, and we decided to go to bed early so we could hit the outlets early the next day.  But the frat party on the other side of us would not let that happen.  I called security SIX times and the front desk twice.  You would not believe this Mickey Mouse operation.  Wilson from security kept making excuses about how they couldn't FIND the party and it must not be that loud and we'd need to get up and get dressed and let the security guard into OUR room so they could see if it was really that loud.  When I got his supervisor, Mark, on the line and he heard the party THROUGH THE PHONE, he promised to take care of it.  Perhaps an hour later, I called again and was told they'd have to warn the party TWICE more before they'd clear the room.  Then I spoke to the night manager of the hotel, Greg, and he was totally incompetent.  He didn't offer to move us to a different room or give us a later checkout time or anything.  When I said we'd been calling over and over for two hours, he said that the hotel policy is that people are allowed to be as loud as they want in their rooms until midnight and he \""wasn't going to compensate us.\""\n\nAlso, be aware that the valet will almost certainly be \""full\"" and even as hotel guests, you'll have to self-park far away.  This was their policy all weekend and I have to say I've never encountered that at any other hotel in Vegas--they always have room for their guest's cars. Apparently they only provide valet service to owners of the condos.  Maybe they're hoping that will make you want to buy one of their poorly-constructed condos.  And be forewarned, every time you walk through the lobby, you WILL be assaulted by insane condo salesmen.  These people are desperately trying to get you to book a tour and  I'm not at all surprised they're having such trouble moving these things.  The only people I can imagine actually wanting to own here are the frat boys who were staying in Room 5506."
0,"How ridiculous, soft opening? Looked at website after I got there, it says they open at 4pm and sign on door says they open at 5pm. They need to figure this out, maybe I'll think about coming back. But with the reviews so far, doesn't seem like anyone should bother to waste time and money."
0,"Disappointing Brunch.   Some hot dishes cool, unmarked dishes. Fennel coleslaw??  Server was the pits, Alex? Neglected to tell us we could order eggs/omelets. When we saw a table nearby receive their eggs (after we were already finished) we asked her for future reference how do we get eggs & she responded \""Basically you just have to ask. I discouraged omelets because the kitchen gets backed up, it can take up to 20 minutes & then people complain if they can't eat at the same time.\""\nWTF? So by \""discouraging omelets\"" she meant not telling her customers who are paying for them anyways! All-you-can-eat is a joke because the line was all the way out the door & we asked her if it would let up & she said \""Probably not. Check?\"" Felt like she was just trying to turn the table over as quickly as possible. \nSeriously, worst waitress ever. Brought out-of-town guests & probably wouldn't go back again..."
0,"We were told this course was in great shape, then we arrive to notice after hole #1 that the course isn't even real grass. It's Bermuda grass which is far more difficult to shoot off of. Other than that it was pretty open and forgiving if you were to push one to the right our hook to the left. Also very confusing to drive on the cart paths if you have never played there before. They need much better signage."
0,"Ordered the pasta fresca. Very bland flavoring, pasta under cooked, veggies were not from the best gardens for sure.  This place scores lower than the average cheese cake factory."
0,"Worst experience ever! If I could give this place no stars .... I would! Me and the hubby decided to try something new for our 10 year anniversary and we chose Le Chalet. We made reservations and asked if they did anything special for anniversaries. They said no but they do like to recognize them so the gentleman that took our res said he would note it. Well when we arrived they sat us in the middle of the bar. It was the least romantic location they could of sat us in! But hey...I wasn't going to complain. We ordered an app that was recommended by the waitress. It came out quickly but the bacon on it was practically raw....but hey...I wasn't going to complain. 1 hour after being sat we still did not have our entrees. Never complained because the waitress came to our table twice to say it's coming right out. After the first time she said it...a table of 4 that arrived just a few minutes after us got their food. Then she came back again and said it's coming out now...and it did but it stopped short at the table of two that had arrived 25 minutes prior. That was it...we stood up to go and the chef and waitress came over and said our ticket had been lost...and that sort of thing happens etc. Then another gentlemen who was seating people but not us tried to correct me by saying we had only been waiting 55 minutes not a full hour. I was floored. Look we were one of 4 tables total in the place. This kind of thing happens I'm sure but not to a place that is failing so bad that they have a whopping 4tables. If you don't mind bad service then at least heed my warning on a place that no joke serves you raw pork. If that still doesn't bother you then at the very \nleast don't go for a special occasion. They are the worst....all around!\n\nUpdate: This is what the owner sent to me after reading my review. Apparently he thinks I created a fake account under the name Robert which is hilarious at this point. This is no way to win back a customer. If he read my review he would see that his eyes in the sky match up with everything I said...except he is taking the side of his horrible front of house staff instead of listening to a customer who's story is not new. Look at past reviews and you will find the same problem over and over. Check it out...this is how not to treat a customer!\n\nHi Jennifer, Robert and Shawn Anderson,\nI am one of the owner of \""le Chalet\"". I read all tree bad reviews on yelp. I always try to get to the bottom of things. We are sorry that your ticket for your entre got misplace. We tried to make it up to you then. I even ask the manager to call you and invite you back to make it up to you.  However I had the possiblilty the see your event on my Video camera. Yes I have eyes in the sky. That help me to know the truth when I am not there. I don't want to react before I know all the facts.  Your stayed was between 6:05 PM to 6:55 PM during this hour You have your drinks and a split Flammenk\u00fcchen which you took 10 minutes to eat it all. Unfortunalty your order was lost and it took us 20 minutes to realize it. Again we are sorry it happened. But you desided to blow everything out of proportion then and on your review. Even twisting the truth little. Why created extra profile to bring us down? Never on the tape you complained about your sitting or on he food that ate. So it is very hard for any staff to be able to read your mind. Believe me if it is something wrong with my food I will call the waiter and I won't eat it until is fix. You did look at the wine list after you finished the presume raw bacon flammenk\u00fcchen. But never place an order. I could see the waitress talked to you after you looked at it when she was refiling your ice tea. When we realised the mistake my partener the chef tried to talk to you we were ready to fixed it. But you decided to make a scene and left with out paying your check for what you ate and then trash us on yelp. We are a private own restaurant we don't have the luscury of big corporation. It is stuff enough out there for new business to have someone to trash us. We knows me and my partener are born in America. However we do employed 27 born american people which are glad to have a job and really try to do there best of what they know. Unfortunatly human error could happen and if you cannot deal with human error. I really don't know, how you could live in that imperfect world. I am ready to invite you again to our establishment to fix our mistake to make you feel better. However I need you to calm down and review the fact. And try to be fare this time. \nThank you\nAlain P. Keller"
1,"This place is very interesting, and very delicious.  \n\nLocated off 215 and North Decatur, Goldfinger's is probably one of the first Bar and Grill you might see when you get off the 215 and headed North of Decatur.  At first, wasn't sure what to make of it, and wasn't sure if was still open.  But when we got there, there were plenty of room to park.  Its one of those places that has separate rooms, to either dine in or, sit at the bar and watch sports.  We decided to dine in and try it out.  \n\nAt first, we were the only people in the dining area and had thoughts of this place having a wait staff around.  But a few minutes later, some one came out and greeted us.  It wasn't busy, so there wasn't really a rush for them to service us.  But they lady was nice and helpful, as well as, funny and entertaining.  \n\nAfter looking over the menu, I ordered the sirloin steak special they had going.  I'll admit, it was really good.  The steak was made to perfection.  It wasn't as hard, nor was it chewy like a tire.  But if I'm able to cut it with a butter knife with no problem, then that is a nice tender steak.  I did have a steak knife, but didn't realize I was using my butter knife till I put the butter knife down, next to the steak knife.  The wife had the Le Cordon Bleu, which I'll admit, tasted really good too. The servings was a good size portion, that the wife couldn't finish hers, so I finished it for her.  Unfortunately, no dessert this time, since we were stuff, but the sound of deep fried oreo's did make my mouth water.   \n\nOverall, a diamond in the rough.  I'll be honest, I was skeptical, but it turned out to be a well worth the trip.  Very well recommended."
0,Came here hoping for few different local beers only to fine out that the actually beer menu lists Yuengling...got excited  for a minute only to be shot down by the bartender that says they dont and wont carry Yuengling. The reason its listed is because the company is east coast based and these lazy bastards dont even update the menu for las vegas. This is a simple yet stupid thing done by this company. I will NEVER AGAIN visit ANY of these locations. I will also be certain to spread the word of the false advertisement by Millers Ale House.
1,"I was a big fan of Lucille's in GV and was stoked when I heard this location had opened. We decided Thanksgiving was as good a day as any to check this place out for some Thanksgiving dinner...even though we went for lunch. They take reservations both online and via phone, which was great for us because I had to ensure that I had enough time to eat and then go to work afterwards. \n\nLucille's Thanksgiving dinner meal consisted of turkey or honey ham (of half of each, which is what we got) with gravy, green bean casserole, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, biscuits w/ apple butter and a small personal pumpkin pie. The food was delicious and we even had leftovers because we couldn't finish it. The best part was the personal pie that was amazingly creamy and served with tons of whipped cream.\n\nThe staff was nice and I like how they work as a team instead of customers only being able to flag down their assigned waiter/waitress like traditional restaurants. I also loved that they had TVs everywhere in the dining area so we were able to catch glipses of the Thanksgiving Day parade and football game while we were there. Definitely will be back to have some of their more traditional BBQ grub!"
0,The coffee was excellent but unfortunately the pastry I got was quite stale. It was a honey roll with pecans and was totally unacceptable for a reputedly good pastry shop. I won't be back.
0,"way too overrated.\nthe bouncer bullshit about guest list. Dropped him $40 and suddenly there was no guest list. Waited in line for a long time, and very disappointed when I finally got in. Seriously, my spotify plays better music than the dj here."
0,This company is HORRIBLE!! They don't know the meaning of customer service. If you are unlucky enough to have them assigned to you from Lowes or Home Depot request another service provider. The scheduler Julie is I must say the rudest customer service person I have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time. They came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer. Said nothing was wrong. After they tech left I found a scratch on my washing machine glass top. This company is full of crack pots who need a reality check. Nice job Julie!
1,"I like Meat & Potatoes. I've been there several times but I just went for brunch, so let me write about that. \n\nI had a daily special which was the pork belly with savory oats, fruit kimchi and a fried egg. This is one of the more unusual dishes that I've tried there, and it really worked for me. The rich pork balanced well with the acid in the kimchi.\n\nI sampled some of my dining companions' choices as well and enjoyed most of their dishes. I tried the brisket flatbread, which was excellent; the eggnog French toast, which was good but didn't really excite me; and the sausage and biscuit (another daily special). That last one. Man. It was oversalted. Like: Dead Seas oversalted. It was sent back and quickly replaced with something more enjoyable. The coffee was good too. \n\nService was good but sort of... hover-y. Plates were removed from the table as soon as the last bite was consumed (or prior to in one case) . Almost all the serving staff has an earpiece which gives the place a bit of a Secret Service feel---not the most relaxing vibe for a lazy Saturday brunch.\n\nI will definitely be back."
1,"I was visiting Las Vegas and this place was recommended to me. The food was great (try the Vegan Wynn burger-- absolutely amazing). We went here several times.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the wait time-- and that the serving staff often seemed to get orders wrong or confused, which was odd, because we were specifically given a number when we ordered.\n\nStill, one of the best places I've eaten."
0,"I had heard Salerno's is a good option for Italian food in the east valley, so I decided to give it a try. I went about an hour before closing and was seated very promptly by a very friendly employee. \n\nI decided I would try the pasta and went with the manicotti. I thought it was a bit expensive compared to several other options (Casanova Brothers and Buono's) in the east valley, but went forward with it anyway. The manicotti came with a salad and bread, and I selected the Italian dressing. \n\nI received the salad and bread promptly. The salad contained fresh, crisp lettuce, but the dressing was very oily and lacked taste. The bread was decent, but nothing spectacular. Not too long after the salad came, the manicotti arrived. I was surprised to see it on a plate that was dripping sauce off the sides. I cannot recall ever going to an Italian restaurant and receiving a plate that so poorly contained the dish. The red sauce was fairly tasty, but the manicotti was bland in taste and was not hot enough. I wondered if it had been heated up rather than baked. The portion was large at least, so there was food to take home.\n\nOverall, I was not that impressed with my experience at Salerno's. Everything about the place including the service and decor was OK, but not particularly good or memorable except for the sweet employee who greeted me. I think I will stick with my other favorites for Italian food rather than returning here."
0,"What is going on with the service in this place??!  You can have good food but if your service is lacking no one will eat there!!!!  \n\nI drove to Lobby's about three to four weeks ago now, on a Sunday, I looked up their hours which are listed on their website AND on their door as Sunday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. My family and I arrived at 6 pm.  All the lights were off but there was a girl at the register.  We walked in and she said WE ARE CLOSED.  We tried to see if there was a reason the door and website said that they should be open but she wasn't having any part of our conversation.  We chalked it up to a bad night and returned again a week later on a Friday evening, which their hours are listed as Monday to Friday 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  We arrived at 7:15 to the same scene of lights off but a person at the register.  It was the same girl as last time so we didn't even bother walking in this time because she was so rude last time. \n\nI emailed them through their website asking what was going on and I have yet to receive a reply.  Who runs a business like this???  It is really unfortunate because each time we went to Lobby's we would take a friend or two so they can see how delish their food is only to be greeted by rude employees and closed doors!  I don't know if I will be back or recommend this place anymore.  Like I said you can have good food but if your service isn't up to par no one will go there!\n\nI had slow service the last time I was actually able to eat there.  There are way too many good burger joints out there to choose from to put up with this. I am sorry but they have dropped the ball.  I will not be back."
0,"not gonna say they're all horrible but some of the people here at the counter are completely rude, full of attitude and down right IGNORANT. they need people skills training. But then again it is not just my personal experience that LA FITNESS does not care for their image nor for their current members."
1,"The new and improved RigaTony's is open for business.   Located in the former Tres Margaritas location in South Tempe, the restaurant looks like it has been redone from top to bottom and feels more open.  There is a nice bar area and while not opened yet they are working on some outside seating just in time to enjoy the spring weather.  The food is main stream down home italian.  The place was busy and I asked the server and she mentioned since opening on April 1, they have had up to 2 hour waits. I am sure it will settle down but it would not hurt to call for a reservation for dinner.  I will definitely be surprising a friend with a trip here for lunch.  Overall a welcome addition to the neighborhood."
1,"Really busy and pretty quick service.  Overall it was good.  A couple things came out not as ordered but nothing worth raising a fuss.  Quality is consistent and good.  The owner, Oak, is very kind and accommodating."
0,"I wish i had the opportunity to get some work done here! I've emailed several (5) times to try and get an appointment but only had one reply with a curt \""we can do that\"" :( What the heck..no one seems to want to make an appointment or take my money. Seriously have to question the work of a shop that can't be bothered to make an appointment. What a shame as I was really looking forward to getting my first tattoo from H&H."
0,This place is really bad. Bad food and bad service. Do yourself a favor and go to The Vine instead. It's just down the street. Don't get the wings or sliders here for sure.
1,"Six years ago I used A Master Mover to help with my move and the service was amazing. Well when it came time for me to move again I knew exactly who to call. Tim was just as punctual, affordable, and attentive as before. I didn't have any issues and the quote was reasonable and didn't change on the day of the move. I will continue to use this company and recommend the service to anyone else I know. You just don't find great customer service like this anywhere."
0,Spend a little more and take a taxi. Just rude. Tried to tell us that even though we paid for hotel pick up that we had to walk 3 hotels away. We knew more about the events going on than they did. No accountability.
1,"I love this place! Everyone, including the other guests, is so nice and welcoming.\n\nI usually only go for karaoke, and my favorite DJ is AC. His nights are Wednesdays to Saturday's. I don't know what the other person is talking about, but when it gets really busy, the wait to sing a song can get up to over an hour. If you want to sing sooner, actually tip the dj. That's how the DJ makes money, and not many people tip well, so if you consistently tip nicely, you won't have to wait AS long as say the other people (like me) who don't tip at all.\nAnd don't be an ass. Assholes probably have to wait longer than everyone else.\n\nI'm only saying all of this as someone who's lived in Vegas forever and actually understand that people are generally nicer to you if you're not an asshole and tip well.\n\nSonny, the bartender is awesome too. I only met Jenn once but she's sweet and she made this delicious drink that I drank for the rest of the night and then I got really drunk.\n\nFun times."
0,"Sorry, after going to Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan this place wasn't even on the same level. \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" explains it well, Yelp. Everything was just ok, and pretty much what you would expect from a Vegas buffet. If we hadn't been so hungover/hungry/walked all the way to Mirage already we wound't have stayed to eat, but it was a solid choice to feed a group of people who are just hungry.\n\nIf you have the option to go somewhere else, do it. There is to much to try and see in Vegas, don't waste your time here!\n\nNote: This place is right off the casino, so be prepared to smell cigarettes the whole time you eat too..."
1,"Love this place!  Quick, precise, as painless as I imagine you can get, and so very -professional.  Tracy has done some of the more obvious menu requests for me, as well as some special requests, too.  Don't be shy about asking if they can do it; they probably can and already have."
0,Very filthy floors trash overflowing restrooms filthy and the automatic light turns off to quickly. So go fast.  No seat covers in restroom. \nDOGNUT were ok but a not so favorable experience
1,"Best BBQ in town.  Kansas city beef ribs, hush puppies, and beer. Cleaned up bikers bar with great food. Love this place!"
1,"Got a reservation at Le Cirque for my 30th birthday.  Great meal - we got the pre-theater menu.  Price seemed very reasonable compared to other items on the menu.  The restaurant also gave us a free starter and my wife a small 'jewelry box' with two chocolate truffles in it after dessert.  The service was excellent.  I highly recommend the wine pairing with meal, that made the good food even more enjoyable.  It might be worth calling ahead and asking if you can get a table near the window so as to get a better view of the Bellagio fountains."
0,"My brother and I came here for a Thursday \""holiday\"" meal on 12/24/09 with dinner pricing at $27-ish+tax+tip and a half an hour wait. The menu looked promising and we had moderate expectations given that this was a new hotel of the MGM Mirage group that would likely have some experience with pushing food at buffets - but we were sadly, sadly disappointed.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nFirst off, there the buffet line and stations are very utilitarian and remind you of a cafeteria - not a whole lot of good interior design went into designing this space and they wanted to seat us literally a yard away from the the entrance/exit with no barriers between the oncoming traffic. We requested another table and they were kind enough to oblige us.\n\nHowever, getting to the food - there were long lines for the \""seafood\"" section - in which case only shrimp and crab legs were served. Just as we were approaching to serve ourselves - the trays were refilled with literally ROCK HARD FROZEN seafood - inedible, crusty with ice crystals. Even once you let it defrost - it was waterlogged, soggy, mushy and tasteless. \n\nThere were two or three carving stations. One with an Indian-style (tandoori?) tri tip or a flatter-style steak where they'd carve you a single small strip and expect you to go on your merry way. The prime rib was cooked beyond well-done. The asian dishes were sub-par as well (wonton soup - the won tons were doughy, undercooked, and the kind with the super thick wrappers that you know no real establishment that caters to the Chinese would serve)\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nMy highlight of the night was taking the tikka masala sauce (and passing on the dry sinewy chicken that soaking in it) and mixing it into bowls of basmati rice... mmm so good!!!! This literally saved my meal and stopped me from good-flavor-starvation. But definitely not what I should've paid for. The flank steak was wonderful with the garlicy/oniony topping. Desserts had a nice selection, gelato was passable, and pastries were what you'd expect them to be."
1,"Cool truck! I like the idea and wish there were more food trucks running around Vegas like this one. Food was pretty good, the fries were the best. Tried the #1 just to get the taste of whatsup, not the most well-done burger but good. They move around but seem to keep the schedule updated. The only negative thing is that their website is just a flippin' mess!!!! Also 8pm is kinda late to open up isn't it? Specially for $10 1/4 burger. We'll try them when they come to Findlay Fiat again"
1,Indian food.\n\nLunch Buffet.\n\nRice pudding.\n\nNuff said.
0,"This is actually no longer the Wyndham, it is a Renaissance now. While the hotel looks nice and the rooms are modernly decorated, the walls are PAPER THIN. I always expect a little bit of noise staying in a hotel, but when the person in the next room is talking at a normal volume at 2am, I shouldn't wake up thinking there is a person in my room. Every word said in the neighboring rooms could be heard, including the \""you look sexy in red...\"" conversation. Even though I have no complaints about the other aspects of my stay, I wouldn't stay here again. \n\nAlso, Wi-fi is $13 a day."
1,"I used Vegas Atmosphere for a close friends divorce party. Being a female, I wasn't sure about how to throw a fun weekend for a guy and this seemed like a fun option. Sam provided models that were fun and got the party started. My friend had a blast at Drais pool / beach club and had no idea all the beautiful girls entertaining him were professional atmosphere models ! \nThis is a great service if your looking to have a Vegas party weekend or celebration . What's nice too is that the models weren't sleazy or trashy . I had a great time with them ."
1,"Cheese = Amazing\n\nCheese curds = amazing x2\n\nThe hidden gem of this place, however is the red velvet fudge.  Snatch some up immediately.\n\nService was also very helpful.  \n\nSumming it up:  stop here if you can."
1,My family loves to come here for family fun days. It is newly remodeled and with lots of TVs with sports and cartoons. Every time we go it is very clean. The atmosphere is very friendly and the pizza is good too. They have tons of new games and they were all in working order.
0,"I really didn't want to write this review but I'm so mad and no one is answering the phone. I've called three times and it just rings and rings. The first time I went to Kneaders on Ray, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and thought it was great. I work in Ahwatukee and it was a quick grab through the drive through before heading back to Tempe where I live. I went back the next week for the same order through the drive through. When I got home, they had forgotten the bacon on my Turkey Bacon Avocado. I was bummed. I mean, the bacon is the best part! But I let bygones be bygones. I even went back today. Same order through the drive through. When I got home, I was starving, had the baby in the backseat crying, was struggling with my bags and was ready to eat my sandwich in peace. But they forgot the bacon AND the avocado. I am probably too upset about this. My husband thought I had gotten some terrible news--I was close to tears. I just wanted to call the manager and tell them that that they should tighten up protocol but they didn't answer which made me even more mad, so here I am, not wanting to be mad but fueling it all by writing this review. I guess the moral of the story is check your food when you go through the drive through--but I shouldn't have to peel through the layers, hunting for crucial, delicious parts of a sandwich that are IN THE TITLE OF THE SANDWICH. So I won't be back. I feel a little bit better now. But not much."
0,"Finished watching a ballet performance and thought this place looked like a good spot.  Well I was wrong. I got the sampler platter, everything was over cooked and had no taste. I would have to say that Applebee's sampler platter is way better then what I ate. The waiter made me feel rushed and when I asked him a question he just said look at the menu. (Okay but isn't it your job to know the menu.) The bathrooms had a weird smell and were dirty. On my way home I starting getting a stomach ache.  Please done waste your hard earned money and eat here."
0,"I'm a huge fan of Gordan Ramsay, so I was super excited about trying this place out.  The line to be seated was LONG, but that made me even more excited.  It took about 45 minutes for my girlfriend and I to finally get seated.  Once we ordered, it took about another 45 minutes for the food to come out.  We were thinking at least it means the food was super fresh and made to order.  When we finally got the food, it was such a disappointment.  Both our burgers were bland and the fries were horrible.  Our server wasn't really friendly at all, we got a little attitude when asking for regular ketchup.  In the end, I'm still a Ramsay fan, I love his shows but I'll never come back here again."
1,"Go very hungry. There is a ton of food. The carvers can be a little snippy when you don't know what you're doing would be my only complaint. Overall great food, the desserts were really excellent."
1,"If you're looking for fresh, healthy, quick and tasty, The Blue Burrito is a sure bet. We recently tried the Shea/Scottsdale Rd. location (NE corner), which has a very attractive bar. The whole restaurant has a modern, comfortable, welcoming feel, but the long bar really caught our attention. It's the perfect place to come after work to enjoy a drink, some socializing, not spend a lot or wait long for your food.  We originally ordered only iced teas until we saw how reasonably priced the margaritas were, which were delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe staff was friendly, patient, helpful and exuded the feeling that they liked working there. I even chatted a bit with Memo the cook, whose open kitchen was clean and orderly.\n\nAs for the food, it's very satisfying and will cause next-day cravings! My husband orders the shrimp burrito, which is really big! I must have the machaca beef tacos and our little one likes the cheese quesadillas. The rice and beans are good sides, but the free chips,  pico de gallo and the available salsas are positively addictive! \n\nThis location is now our favorite Blue Burrito :)"
0,"In my best Damon Waynas voice, \""Hated it!\""  I long since realized that Cirque is like Richard Gere said to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, about opera: you either love it or you hate it.  I'm on the strong side of hate with Cirque.\n\nFirst introduced myself years ago, when it became the talk of the town.  Attended three \""very different\"" Cirques since then (regular, risque, and this water show), to find them all the same.  Yawn!  Wasted $!\n\nSomeone told me that Le Reve is not a Cirque show.  Could have fooled me.  Everything reminds me of it.  So if you like CdS, you'll like this.  As for the theatre, not a bad seat in the house.  Front rows get splashed.  Back rows get champagne service.  Unfortunately, rows too long and tight to move from your seat without seriously disturbing everyone else in the row, or else I would have left.  Yes, THAT disappointed."
0,"Extremely disappointed in the service here . After driving for 30 minutes to get to this doughnut shop our friend convinced us to get up and go to we were left with a selection of 3 different types of doughnuts . We told them it was our first time and how far we had driven to come in . All we were told was oh well it's national doughnut day you should have come earlier . No coupon to get us to come back and I'm assuming the older man who opened the door for us was the owner and unlike one of the reviews where he gave them a free doughnut to try no offer or even attempt was made to make our trip worth it . \n\nThe reason I'm giving it 2 stars was because of the actual donut, it was decent . The service was terrible . I definitely won't be driving out of my way to go there again ."
0,"Stick with the pizza and wings. Though I haven't had either, I did order a buffalo chicken sandwich last night that was missing all the requirements of a buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled and a dab of buffalo sauce was added to the bun as if it were ketchup on a burger. As a grilled chicken sandwich it was ok, but not what I was expecting for a buffalo chicken sandwich. Every time a serve passed with someone else's order of buffalo wings I felt a bit cheated."
1,"After reading Yelp for sometime, I signed-up to write this review of the Hard Rock.  Over the years, I've stayed at most of the major properties in Las Vegas and over the past 5 or 6 stays have settled here. \n\nI can't give them 5 stars, cause it's not a Wynn/Encore type joint... but a solid 4 they deserve.  I've stayed in each of the towers.  HRH is perfectly upscale and quiet enough get a good night's sleep before a meeting.  The Paradise Tower is also nice, but a bit far away from the action.  The main tower has been redone and now has many of the same features as the newer towers, plus the famous french-doors that open for fresh air.\n\nThe hotel staff has always been friendly and helpful to me... you get  back what you put out you know.  Mr. Lucky's food is exactly what I like... standard diner type fare that's always hot and fresh. Pink Taco is great too.  \n\nJust watched the NBA title game last week at one of the bars in the new section.  It was a great time.  All in all, I think you'll be hard pressed to beat the value the Hard Rock offers."
1,"This was my first time and I had a great experience. I can't remember now what we got, but I remember everything we ordered was good. Portions were big and service was very friendly. I remember the coffee being decent too."
0,"We ordered the cranberry pecan chicken salad sandwich.  It was lacking in flavor, very bland. We also ordered the pulled pork spring rolls, which were not pleasing to the palette -- southern BBQ does not mix well with Asian cuisine!  Two small spring rolls for $7.50 was definitely not worth it."
0,"Since I moved Vegas have heard about this place. Gave it try today. Was very disappointed. Place is overhyped, mediocre food. Won't be going back."
0,These sandwiches scare me.....
1,"All the elements came together perfectly one Friday night: great service, great food, wonderful company, and amazing atmosphere to create a very, very good memory for me.  The food was roll-around-in-it good, but I was most amazed by the Server who had the most wonderful sense of timing and a dry (barely discernible, but very much THERE) sense of humor.  She was a joy to talk to!  I can't wait to return to this little slice of heaven!"
0,"I have been going to this MImi's Caf\u00e9 on a regular basis for the last 13 years, but earlier this week, they have completely rearranged the menu, and most of my old favorites are gone.  The food quality has gone down considerably too.  The Cobb Salad used to be great, but the last time I was there, there were just a few bits of hard boiled egg, tomato, bacon, and blue cheese, in what was mostly just a bowl of shredded lettuce.  And they charged me $9 for that.  The manager, who speaks really hard to understand English, did not seem to think anything was wrong with that.  The fans on their Facebook page are in open revolt, and all the Mimi's Caf\u00e9 people can say is \""change is hard\"" and that people should try something else on the menu.  They don't get it.  The burden of persuasion is on them, not the customer.  Stay away, at least until they come to their senses."
0,They messed up our reservation didn't get to eat...had to leave to get to Comerica after 30 minute wait...
0,"ugggggggggggggggggghhhhh... I will never visit this place again!!!!\n\n1- You are on the complete opposite side of the strip\n2- they are still charging a crazy amount per night\n3- The rooms are old, and make me want to sleep in my car.\n\nThe hotel is very old. I did not have the best experience there. I had to call room servicer to have them change my sheets. They were not clean. I dont recomend this place at all.\n\nBut on a bright side i will give the buffett a 5 stars. I keep telling myself tht if i go back to Vegas i will visti their buffett. You pay I believe $15 or $16 per person all you can eat. But they have a pasta buffett where they will cook you chicken, shrimp, with any kind of pasta i personally loved it this must of been the best thing about the entire trip. The buffett highly recomended. To stay, defenitley find else where."
1,"The gator bites tasted like cooter but that's straight cause I enjoy cooter, opossum, coon and all sorts of critters. And I would know cause I'm from Louisiana the swamp part. Anyways yeah, I love this cooter or opossum whatever it was."
1,"I was lucky enough to get to dine at two Ethiopian places during my last week in Phoenix.  After Blue Nile, I was dying to experience Lalibela and get another taste of Ethiopian food.\n\nI came here during lunch, and I have to say their specials were awesome.  $7.99 for your choice of 3 options of meat or vegetarian, injera or rice, and a drink.  Pretty good deal if I do say so myself.\n\nI settled on the veggie options of the two lentil dishes and the green beans and carrots with injera.  My guy got the three meat dishes and injera.\n\nThe food came quickly, and I have to say these portions are much bigger than Blue Nile.  And I think these might be a bit tastier.  I loved the spicy lentils and the beans and carrots.  And the sauces in my guy's meat dishes were equally amazing.\n\nNow that I've popped my Ethiopian cherry, I'm determined to learn how to cook some damn good Ethiopian food.  I doubt it can match this place, but I'm not going to be finding Ethiopian in Salem and I need my fix!"
0,"I want to like Cannery Grill.  It's hard though.  I think my last visit was just that... my last  visit.  The server was attentive, rightly so, we were one of 5 table on a weeknight around dinner time.  I ordered the special, which was a filet, it was cooked, under seasoned...  the sides were average.  The meal came with one of those bake and serve dinner rolls, which must have been baked a day or two ago and served to me as a dry pale stale rock.  My wife and I agreed that we'll pass the cannery up from here on out and go elsewhere."
1,"This tiny, unassuming restaurant, home to Frank, the friendliest Syrian I've ever met, has some of the best shawarma this side of the Atlantic.  Can't wait to go back to try their falafel and fresh juices!"
0,Went here to eat dinner...i got the cast iron steak....it was burnt full of char...have to drench in bbq for any flavor. I know its a bbq place but wanted just a steak. My wife got the catfish. Little slivers of catfish strips that were a lil too fishy for her. Best thing was the side but that being said u get a small scoop of those! We wont be going back due to the food....the time it took the server to get our food. I think they were a lil understaffed
1,"Probably the best sushi in town. Fresh fish - always ! (not easy in AZ)\nWe always enjoy the strong drinks . Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place! \nThe bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent $200 at the restaurant... \nI would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !"
1,"I had to try this place from recommendations from a fellow co-worker.  the outside is very underestimating as the inside is on a whole other level. It is comfy, cozy, and the music is awesome. keeps a positive train of thought as you wait for your pizza. the wait was long but expected as they make the pizza right in front of you.. Literally they have a glass wall and you can watch them make the pizza. I had no problems waiting as the final product was ridiculous! ! we had the 18\"" with cheese, eggplant, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and olives. along with their garlic rosemary knots. the pizza was great, the marinara sauce was very flavorful but not overpowering.  the mozzarella cheese tasted fresh, the toppings were very flavorful and did not disappoint at all! pizza was on another level from others ive tried in my opinion and is highly recommended. the garlic rosemary knots are awesome. the knots are a bit dense and tough but after all it is a knot lol! but I didnt mind as the garlic and rosemary was very intense and was a great surprise as the knots ive had around town fall way short on the flavor category, not these though! They are perfect and a must try with their pizza. oh I also ordered their cannoli and I am currently waiting to try them as I am stuffed!! we finished half the pizza and there was two of us and I am satisfied! ! if you like pizza and havent tried this place, put your usual pizza spot on hold for once and go here it will not dissapoint!!\n\nUpdate: so I had the cannoli!  It was good. It did however taste like a twist on what a canoli im used to taste like. It has the look. The shell is good and crispy, very dense shell. The filling to me tasted like a cream cheese/ cinnamon cream filling. It was good, just not what I expected. Try it out and let me know what you all think??"
1,"Great food decent ambiance and fair prices, why is this place not packed?\n\nWE started with the fool, a warm mix of mashed garbanzo beans, seasonings topped with onions and tomato it was great.\n\nFor the main dish we went with the vegetarian musaka, which is eggplant in a red sauce. on't confuse this with an Italian dish, as the flavors are very different  It comes with a well cooked long grain rice which compliments it nicely."
0,"This shop is cute and while there are several dressing rooms you should definitely make an appointment because it's small and there were only 2 associates working the best I could tell.  The stylist that helped me with the dresses was helpful and sweet but when I asked them to write down a style number on a dress so I could get the opinion of my maid of honor and bridesmaid who were unable to come with me they were coy.  They told me that since it is a discontinued dress there was no way possible that I'd EVER find a picture of it online because the manufacturer pulls the pictures when they discontinue a model.  I let them know I understood that but that in the vast world wide web that I was certain there would be a picture of it SOMEWHERE even though it is no longer for sale by the manufacturer.  They continued to assure me that the manufacturer had ensured that every single solitary picture of this dress ever taken would NOT be anywhere on the web.  I knew I was taking my chances walking away from the beautiful dress but I don't care how great it was nothing was making me give them my money after telling me something so outlandish of that nature.\n\nI felt that they must have been so concerned that I would find the dress somewhere else for a lower price that they didn't want to give me the information about the dress lest I choose to buy it from someone other than them.  As a result I left there and went to Brilliant Bridal where I walked in with no appointment, found a perfect dress for only  $525 ($300 less than the one at Kiara's) that is gorgeous and has TONS of detail.\n\nI will say though that one wonderful thing about this shop is that you can haggle the prices.  When I told them what my budget was and asked if there was more they could do for me on that price since it was outside my budget once I did alterations they were willing to contact the owner and get a better deal by throwing in some alterations.  They have great dresses so if you can get a good deal it might be worth the lack of information they are willing to provide."
0,"Where do I begin... well, let me start by saying you don't matter to Mandalay Bay unless you're a 'whale' (their term for big time gamblers).  If you're here with your family for a vacation and just looking to have fun -- sorry, even if you can afford it, you're not getting a cabana.  You're lucky to even get a chair.  They will -- as they've personally told me -- physically remove you from a cabana if one of their 'whales' so happens to desire the cabana you're in.  It's their policy.  They might make up for it by giving you a lawn chair out in the 110 degree heat with no sun protection... you know, where you belong!  Equivalent to 'let them eat cake' in my opinion. \n\nFurthermore, let's say you're like me and you do happen to gamble a lot.  Maybe you've even made their second highest status (Platinum) like me... yeah, that doesn't matter either.   In fact, on two separate occasions now it has yet to matter.  They say Platinum members are given \""priority cabana reservations\"" ...  What they mean to say is, \""you can call us at a special VIP number only to have someone say 'sorry, get lost' in a little nicer tone\"".  It's a complete joke.  They only care about you if you are losing the kind of money that could run most cities for weeks.  \n\nIf you are spending money on dinners and shows and suites and whatnot... get lost, they don't want your business.  If you have a chronic gambling problem and don't mind paying the electric bill for Vegas while you're there... Welcome to Mandalay Bay -- let me kick this family out of a cabana that they should never have been allowed in in the first place!\n\nJust as an aside -- I've only had this experience at MGM properties.  The Wynn, The Cosmopolitan & The Palms actually apologized to me for the treatment I received from MGM properties.  I can tell you honestly they don't treat their guests this way.  Nobody should!"
0,"If I could give it zero stars... I would. Since I moved to Tempe four years ago to go to ASU I have spent thousands  of dollars here from I tip Le Prive Hair couture extensions to lord and  cliff clip ins. I have NEVER had an issue with the employees until my visit yesterday. I went in looking to buy red and blonde hair extensions since that is my color. I know my color is unique and I most likely have to color them, but I wanted to get as close as possible. I was greeted by a nice woman who I think was new because she said she didn't know about the extensions and went to get someone else. The next lady treated me like I was wasting her time. She looked for a minute and told me they did not have any in my color and never have. I told her that I got extensions from Sunnys before and I have even had one person offer to order me some in my color. The woman who was helping me said they have every color their and NOTHING close to my color and told me \"" Well. we don't have anything maybe you should die your hair\"". I was appalled at how RUDE she was that I just turned around and walked to my car. I have never felt so disrespected at Sunnys before. That one employee made me NEVER want to step foot in their again,which is a shame because I have spent so much money there and planned on spending more on a new set. I used to recommend this place to all my girl friends, and after telling them about my experience they will not be returning either. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell your employees a thing or two about how to treat paying customers."
0,"The food was good, once we finally got it. Some of the worst service by the waitstaff ever experienced.  Sushi was order by 2 and steaks by the other 2. Steaks were brought and eaten before any sushi made it to the table.\n\nServer never came by to ask if we needed anything, we had to flag him down, had to ask another server to check on our drink order.on and on.  \n\nFood was good but when served so slowly and so poorly it detracts from the entire experience."
1,"Always been a favorite bar for my boyfriend & I . The vibe here is what I really look for in a bar- easy, no problems. The patio that wraps around the whole old house is really neat & really cool pond.\n\nCold beer & oysters is what I come in for- every time great. Bartenders are really nice & chill . They are attentive & hold good polite convos. \n\nOnly think that bummers me out is I am not closer to the location !"
0,"Pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere.  That's the best way to describe this place.  Indeed, my belly was full -- full of bread.  Where's the beef!?  --- oh the 80's!  My sandwich was mostly bread, lettuce and tomatoes.  The clam chowder was probably the delight of my meal (sandwich & soup combo) Couldn't complain much about the service since it was quick.  The place was super cheap on the decor -- though I did appreciate the helicopter ceiling fan.  Think I enjoyed that more than my sandwich -- Enjoy!"
0,Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead.
1,"I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\n\nOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\n\nOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, \""Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas\"". I'm not sure what that means.\n\nOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \""normal\"" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nOther things I want to go back for:\n\nTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\nClam and Garlic Pizza\nLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\nQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\nCal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\nThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\nAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\n\nLooks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now."
0,Oh my ...dont like the food here. Tried the Pad thai and the chicken fried rice ...the pad thai was disgusting and the fried rice was not enticing either ...wont be going back ...ugh
1,This Port of Subs is located in a very busy shopping center surrounded by corporate buildings and businesses. So beware about going during rush times 11 AM - 1 PM. I happened upon this place because it is close to the yoga studio I am currently going to. It's definitely WAAAY on the other side of town from me - but boy was I glad to find one so close to the studio! It makes for quick meal before or after my yoga class.\n\nThe staff is nice and they're quick. I love POS sandwiches and I rarely happen upon a poorly made sandwich. It has not happened to me here yet. \n\nWord of caution - the parking lot is small and the place itself is quite small. So if you do want to eat in it would be best to go AFTER the lunch and dinner rush.
0,"never going back. The food was really blend, went with a colleague for lunch buffet, every Indian place I have ever been to at least had good chicken tikka masala but it was just too bad here, paneer was equally tasteless. The place was surprisingly full, probably due to lots of IT companies near by."
0,"Sorry guys, but this one was a dud. Went here with a few friends for a drag show because one chickie in the posse had a friend/co-worker performing...we left within 30 minutes. \n\nThe biggest reason we left was because 2 of us REALLLLLLY had to go to the bathroom, the ladies restroom was being used as a dressing room, so we couldn't get in there, so (adaptable and easy-going as we are) we went over to the men's restroom. We were treated SO RUDELY by several of the men in line that it just made sense to saran-wrap our bladders and head over to a friendlier watering hole. \n\nTo quote the wise Sweet Brown...\""Ain't nobody got time fo' dat.\"""
1,The food was fresh and the service from the food servers was outstanding.   When in Las Vegas make the drive out to the Boulder Highway and enjoy the best sushi in all of southern Nevada.
0,"If I could give them zero stars, I would.\n\nIn June, LA Fitness withdrew my monthly fee FIVE TIMES. That's correct: they charged me my monthly dues FIVE TIMES within 30 days. it was never reimbursed.\n\nIt only gets worse.\n\nAround the same time, I moved out of the area, and called to cancel my membership. They told me it had to be done online. I went online and it was literally impossible to cancel that way. For fear that they would continue to withdraw money, I cancelled my debit card and got a new one.\n\nThe harassment begins.\n\nI'm not exaggerating: every week, once or twice a week, I received a call from one of their many call centers around the country, calling to tell me that there is a \""problem with my credit card\"" and that I owe them money. The first call, I explained that no, I do NOT owe them money; that in fact THEY owe ME money, and that I would like to cancel my membership immediately. I was told that I have to do it online. I told them that this was not possible. They told me they'd \""note my account\"".\n\nAt least A DOZEN more calls followed over the next four month (FOUR MONTHS!), all \""informing\"" me that I \""owe them money\"", then me stating that I want to f***ing cancel, then them saying to go online, then me saying - even asking to walk me through it and being told they don't know how!!! - that's not an option, then them saying they'd \""note my account\"".....\n\nThen there was today. Yet another call. Broken record, I'm getting fed up and I threatened to contact the Better Business Bureau (which I will do next). I ask if she can read English, as there MUST be something \""noted on my account\"", yes? No. Nothing. NOTHING. Which leads me to believe that these assholes were just trying to get more money from me.\n\nThe most frustrating part: she literally cancelled my account over the phone in about 15 seconds. (I assume. I received an immediate email confirmation.) Absolutely no reason for those assholes to harass me for 4 months.\n\nOh, the kicker: the email said I still owe them $79. Fact is, technically they owe me over $100, but I'm willing to take the loss to get these assholes out of my life.\n\nDO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT give this company your credit card info...which is the only way to join...so, FIND ANOTHER GYM. \n\nI realize that my complaint is corporate's issue, and not Scottsdale's, but there is no where else to Yelp this and Scottsdale is where I signed up."
0,"I felt like I had walked into the first level of hell when I walked through the double glass doors into the Cox Digital Store to return my cable boxes. When I walked in (carrying no less than THREE boxes, with THREE remotes perched precariously on top and wires dangling down past my ankles), there were three ladies sitting behind desks. Two had customers, one was filing her nails. There were four people ahead of me. One lady looked up and barked at me to take a seat and grab a number (very DMV-esque). Looking around for a place to set down my heavy burden, no seats were available. One guy (a true gentleman) jumped up, grabbed the boxes from me, chivalrously gave me his seat, and then snagged an extra chair from the desk of the lady who was filing her nails (she didn't even look up). After sitting for about 5 minutes, one of the customers currently being helped finished up and left. The lady helping him got up from her desk and went to the back. The other lady with no customers also got up and began boxing up cable boxes (mind you, STILL five people waiting). The third lady finished with her customer, and (thankfully) called the next number. That customer must have had a doozie of a cable issue, because when lady number two came back to her desk, and was about to call the next number, lady number one called her over to the desk to help sort out her customer's problem. Lady #3 went to the back. Meanwhile, more customers began trickling in. FINALLY, they managed to get through the line of customers ahead of me, and it was my turn (30 minutes later). I walked up with my cable boxes (none of which she offered to help me with), and when I told her I needed to return them because my service had been canceled, she just looked at me and said \""you know you could have just mailed those in, right?\"". Um, NO! No one told me that! Would've been helpful, especially since this particular cable hell is located so far north in Scottsdale, I felt like I truly was leaving the city to go on a pilgrimage (similar to Dante's). At any rate, the rating they receive is strictly based on the service received (or not received) during that horrendous 45 minute experience."
0,The food was not very good at all. Definitely should not be considered authentic Mexican. Service was horrible. There was no one in the place / at the bar and it took forever to order / get our food. 25 minutes to get a fried ice cream? Really?!? WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.
0,"The used car dealership of dentistry.  I felt like a medium for their fleecing of the insurance company.  They refused to clean my teeth after I refused their up-sale to a costly (and unnecessary) procedure.  Also, the dentist didn't have the guts to face me himself and tell me this...they sent in the receptionist.  Not even a hygienist.  \n\nI recognize at least 1 of these \""5 star\"" reviews as an employee.  Avoid at all cost.  Find a dentist committed to quality health care and not extracting the absolute maximum from the insurance company.  This place is what is wrong with health care in this country."
1,"This is one of the best honestly taco shops in Henderson. We are here almost every weekend. Carne Asada breakfast burritos are delicious. My son loves the carne asada lunch burrito. I love the machaca, the plate, the burrito and the big tostada bowl."
1,"Cute, tiny interior. Good coffee as well, but let me tell ya: their scones are INCREDIBLE. A cute find that's worth popping in for if you know about it!"
1,I went with my girlfriend for lunch.   She ordered the guacamole burger which I tried some of.   It was one the best burgers that I've had In a while.   I ordered the cajun chicken pasta.   I've had this several times and it's one my favorite dishes.   Add on a fat tire draft beer and you are all set.   \n\nGood food and good service we will definitely be back.
0,"I was undecided between 1-2 stars. We went at about 1 pm on Christmas Day and it was definitely busy. Waited about 20 minutes for a table and took another 15 minutes before ordering. But I was OK with the wait since they were probably understaffed on Xmas Day but the following irked me:\n\nOrange Juice in the menu said fresh squeezed but it was definitely Minute Maid w pulp! I did not appreciate the bait & switch especially at $7.50.\n\nI was served coffee in a dirty cup, which the busser insisted it was the design. Then our server came and said \""oh, your cup is dirty, let me change it\"" o_O I already drank out of it... \n\nFish & Chips @ $22 - the fries were soggy and fish was overdone and definitely pre frozen.\n\nThe only good thing was the 3 egg breakfast & sausage. I thought it was a good value at $14 since we pay more at other places. The sausage was delicious.\n\nFor a bill of about $60, I rather eat at Bouchon or Mon Ami Gabi next time for better quality dishes and even better service."
1,I think the Shark Reef here is probably one of the best attractions in Vegas; and recently it's gotten cheaper! I remember when I used to pay $20 for this place but I went a few days ago and it was only $16/person for an adult. I guess the recession is even hitting the environmentalists.\n\nThis particular aquarium I find to be way more interactive and fun than some of the other places with similar animal attractions on the strip. They have very helpful staff members throughout their well designed exhibits to answer any questions you might have regarding any of the animals. The employee at the piranha exhibit was extra helpful and answered many questions and myths I had!\n\nThis is such a worth while visit especially for a new Vegas visitor or just a refresher like me after not having been for over 2 years. It's definitely very different and takes you into a whole 'nother world as you forget about the smokey bustling strip you just came from.

1,"Ok...I only  gave 4 stars  today because they just fell short of 5  if they could have upped the quantity of the fried clams.   I went here for lunch today as I am a New Englander now just relocated to the Las Vegas area.   When you first walk in it is a basic family restaurant but adorned with Boston area sports pics.\nI was intrigued that they had whole belly clams which are difficult to find outside of the New England states. \nI ordered the lobster roll and to my dismay they were out.  However the owner Kathy realizing my dismay said well your drink is on us today.  Great customer service!  I then went all clamy...so to speak. ..I had a cup of the clam chowder,   a side salad and then the whole belly clam basket. \nFirst, the salad was fresh and served with dressing that you can add on your own if you are counting calories.   Another reason for the stars.  The clam chowder even though served in a Styrofoam cup tasted of the ocean and was full of chopped clams, a little potato and spiked with bacon.   A classic New England clam chowder if well made always tastes like the ocean and the clams are the stars not the milk.   They nailed it! !  The whole belly clams were lightly breaded and then delicately fried to a pale tan brown. \nMy only complaint is that for $17.99 I wish their were more clams but they were fresh and never frozen so I happily parted with my money.  The freshness of  their food is the result of their daily air shipments of seafood. \nThen the owner Kathy went to every table to check on their food service and when she knew I was a new resident introduced herself and made recommendations for my next visit.   Good food plus customer service equals me as a returning customer.  I say support this local establishment!"
1,Been back many times. The owner Jamie and his entire staff are great. 30+ beers food served late and live music. High end snotty Scottsdale place? Nope. Excellent neighborhood joint to have a great time at.
0,"Poor Shawn J.! Should've read his review before going to this place. \n\nI believe this is the same place that sells to the Venetian (at least to their food court). I've had cupcakes at the Venetian and they were okay. So maybe this place had a bad day? \n\nThe place is cute. The cupcakes are adorable globs of sweet. They over-frost, as everyone says, but then the sprinkle it with either raw sugar, choco chips, or sprinkles and then there's another decoration on top of that, such as a flower, or a cookie. Very cute! \n\nNow, I'm not a cupcake connoisseur. You'd never think so from reading my reviews, but I love to buy cupcakes, I don't like to eat them. Does that make any sense? So, in my case, Gigi's is the perfect store for me, because the cupcakes LOOK gorgeous but they taste awful. \n\nCan you imagine putting plaster in your mouth? Then can you imagine adding a ton of sugar to that plaster? That pretty much sums up the flavor of ALL the cupcakes. It didn't matter if it was Citrus Green Tea (ha, don't make me laugh) or Blackberry surprise, it all tasted the same, gummy and over-sweet. There is no other flavor, but the colors of the cupcake are different. Maybe that's why they have different names, it's to describe the color of their cupcakes? \n\nThe only one that tasted barely ok and had any flavor was the oreo cookie, I did get hints of cookie and cream flavor. \n\nThe cakes were really stale and dry. Yuck. \n\nThe lady working was really generous. She gave me three free cupcakes for buying two. Too bad I didn't eat any of them. But I can't fault her, it was good customer service."
0,Workers caused a hassle that would have made us miss a flight if we didn't attempt to return 3 hours early. When we arrived we had nearly a full tank. They didn't accept it and made us pay a very high gas refuel price. We went to a gas station and filled the bit up on our own because it was cheaper. Then they told us our mats were too dirty on the second attempt and quoted us a very high penalty. They should have told us upon the first return attempt. Now we had to go out again and vacuum.\n\nThey charge high penalties for minor infractions an the workers aren't sharp.
0,"I ate at their Tempe location before they moved and had a good experience.  I was excited when they finally opened at their new location.  A friend and I went a few days after they opened and were looking forward to a nice meal.  We were prepared to be very patient because we knew that they were just opened and the staff were still learning.  It was a hot day outside and it felt stuffy inside, so we casually mentioned to our server that it felt warm inside the restaurant and maybe they could check the temperature.  Well, that is when the whole experience went downhill.  A minute later we heard the female owner speaking very loudly near the servers station that it was 76 degrees...it is 76 degrees, she kept loudly repeating that it was 76 degrees.  She then came over to our table and very rudely told us that the thermostat said 76 degrees, so why did we say it was warm?  We just simply said that it felt warm to us and she then proceeded to tell us that we should get up and go look at the thermostat.  It was an extremely off putting experience.  Her tone and demeanor was very unfriendly and we felt like we had been scolded by our grandmother.  \n\nIn my opinion, the food here is a little pricey, but has tasted pretty good when we have eaten there before.  However, my friend and I both felt afterwards that it is not a place that we would ever go again because of the attitude and tone in which we were spoken to. It is a shame, but you can't treat people that way and expect them to come back.  I hope they read this review so they can learn from our experience and prevent further damage to their business reputation."
1,"Small, medium, and large are definitely American-sized portions (9\"", 12\"", and 20\"", respectively). I had a small over the course of two meals. The large looked intimidating as the guys behind the counter were wrapping one up for a delivery order.\n\nWe visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had.\n\nEach sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette.\n\nThe verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10."
0,"There were many more positions than personnel to fill them.  We encountered an inexperienced clerk who tried to upsell us on everything imaginable.  If we hadn't been hip to the cons we'd have been totally ripped off by all the extra (unneeded) charges.  And yet, we got ripped off anyway by an outrageous fee imposed by Phoenix to pay for their new rental car palace.  Beware!  Rent off-site if you can."
1,"Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean, fast and predictable."
0,"Food is nothing close to special, service is decent.  They recently upgraded their beer list which is great. I usually come here for PPV events such as UFC, place does get pretty busy since not many places show UFC PPV events."
0,"When buying jewelry really make sure you are not buying plated instead of the real thing. A week before Thanksgiving I bought a ring that was secured to a card that said sterling silver, got home to realize that it is silver plate.  The store of course offered to do a return but that does not take care of the fact that the ring was mismarked and who knows how many other pieces of silver plated jewelry could also be marked wrong.  I reported it to the store manager and I have yet to hear a solution from her.  She did mention that another customer could have returned it on the wrong card but the ring was secured to the card with a plastic device and it was really hard to cut off with scissors.  Did not look like a return to me because once the plastic is cut it is done.  Buyer Beware."
1,"I was visiting a handful of friends in the Phoenix/Tempe area. I generally just stay with friends but got a hotel room this time. I'll admit, I was going for no frills and CHEAP ....minus bed bugs. There are plenty of hotels in the area due to ASU and the Phoenix airport, so prices are wonderfully competitive. \nRead some reviews here and was skeptical, but seemed worth a try. \nRoom: Upgraded for $5 per night to a king size bed. I had a mini fridge and microwave (wonderful for leftovers!) a single cup coffee machine, a table and chairs and a desk. The blanket was thin and I asked for another, but they worked. A/C, heater fan thing was a window unit but kept everything comfortable. Free WiFi and lot parking. Flat screen tv, dresser and super awkward 2 level corner desk. If you had taken that out you could have fit another full size bed! Was able to open my window a few inches for fresh air as well. A few stains here and there, but everything was pretty clean for an older building. Bathroom was unremarkable but, uh, got the job done. Had Pantene brand shampoo. \nPaid about $55 per night over a weekend (Fri-Sun). The people at the check in desk were friendly  enough and the late night front desk guy even gave us walking directions to a convenience store after a night of bar hopping. Felt secure and housekeeping didn't pester us. Elevator was a little wobbly and old....we took the stairs half the time, the place is only 3 levels tall. \nWould stay here again and recommend it if you get a deal. Cab fare to downtown Tempe/ Mill street is about $8 each way (so think $20 round trip). Plenty of cabs, light rail and busses in the area (so no drunk driving excuses!)\nThis is my first stay at a Red Roof ever and I am more than satisfied....I think having a mini fridge might even convince me to bump this up half a star. I've stayed at some nice hotels and this old little crappy building made me feel very at ease. Sometimes you'd rather have a wave hello at the front desk instead of a tuxedo man opening the door every time you glance inside."
0,"I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap hotel room during a weekday for 29 dollars! The sheets had a hole and tear in them, the bathroom had a crack on the floor and the toilet had a quirk that you had to hold down the lever for it to flush. The bed and pillows were okay. At least there was A/C!\n\nThe variety of pools was good. It seemed like Goldilocks. One with the waterfall was freezing, another one closest to the entrance was cold, and the last one closest to the bar was regular temperature. The waterfall was a nice touch, though. I like that they have two jacuzzis.\n\nThe worse thing is that I thought this hotel was supposed to be new!? It seemed like they took over an old crappy hotel. The elevator was ugly and bad, only one of them worked the whole time. Worst of all, no A/C in the elevator!\n\nThe casino was very small, but all of the dealers and waitresses I had were nice. This casino is too far from the center of the strip, I will definitely consider a closer hotel."
0,"Expected much, much more from this place.  The atmosphere was fine, but the service and food left so much to be desired.  Ordered miso soup, the chicken \""un-fried\"" rice, and several rolls.  All were boring and bland.  The waitress recommended the Dragon roll, so we ordered it.  A different roll came to the table - and she said \""oh, sorry, the buttons are next to each other on the machine when I put in the order.  Do you want to just go ahead and eat that one?\""  Never got the Dragon, and would recommend any other Asian restaurant in Vegas over this one :)"
0,"Anyone driving out here for the first time should know that once you exit the highway, there aren't any gas stations. I nearly ran out of gas because I didn't know I was gonna end up way out in the boonies. I mean, where do all the farmers out here get their fuel?\n\nAs for the zoo itself, there are some animals that you won't see at the phoenix zoo and of course there's the aquarium but I don't really think I'll be going back. The reason I came here to begin with was so my girlfriend could see some penguins. I have to remind myself that we do live in the desert but the penguin exhibit was really sad. It's very small and although the entire front of it is glass, the entire area quickly fills up with children, obstructing the view.\n\nI think instead of driving from the east valley, next time I'll make the trek up to Out of Africa, which I've heard is quite an experience."
0,"We always enjoy el Pollo Loco, so we were disappointed with this place. Upon walking in, the place looked great. Chicken was cooking, and everyone was busy getting ready for the day...it was 10 am. \nSat down and waited for our order. Looking around we discovered that this place is poorly managed. The chair legs were filthy from where a mop had been up against them, there was crud of some kind...food probably...on the window sills, glass doors had hand prints all over them, and there was standing water with some warning signs around it. Little things really, but it all added up.\nThat being said, the tacos carbon and the salsa bar were really good. We had a side of tortilla chips that were stale. They were cold and stale. Blah. My guess is that we will never come back here again. They need better management."
0,"Writing this review on my mobile phone while sitting at the bar at Sushi Ruku in Las Vegas. Had a reservation, but as with the last 2 times I have been here, they are overbooked and there is a long wait.  I'm cool with waiting at the bar, but the bartender hasn't done anything but BS and serve the large group of girls at the end of the bar for the last 45 minutes.\n\nHonestly, the sushi isn't spectacular and the location is tiny, but I wind up getting talked into going here more than I would like to.\n\nThis is the last time I am coming to the Vegas location of Sushi Roku."
1,"we went to binks knowing that the chef was one of the best in town and we got to experience just that, the best in town! food was awesome, with amazing food combinations that you are unsure you are going to like, then you just cant explain how good it is. so good!\n\nthe service was great, our waiter Russ was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the restaurant, the food, the preparation, and was just a good guy, everything he suggested was great. \n\ngo here with the intention of having a family style dinner with everyone sharing each plate, and ask the waiters what to order!"
1,"A colorful,  raucous, sometimes surreal celebration of the Beatles. At times I felt like Alice stepping through the looking glass with a Beatles soundtrack. Every member of our party thoroughly enjoyed the show."
1,"Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer."
0,"I honestly have absolutely no idea how this place has such a high rating. I am positive it wasn't just the experience or the person that I had; the place was just BAD!! \n\nI went for a pedicure, and it was the worst pedicure of my entire life. When I think of a pedicure chair, I think of one of those nice cushy massaging pedicure chairs with the attached tub. I've had varying degrees of newness, cleanliness, and comfortableness with those pedicure chairs, but never in my life have a had a pedicure in anything but those chairs. ATOLV did not even have pedicure chairs! They had rickety red straight back chairs no different than you might find in a college dorm (and super tacky looking). \n\nFor the foot tub, they had a little bowl, like from Walmart, filled with water that cooled off very quickly (imagine that), and fake, wicked tacky rose petals. As you can probably imagine, a straight back, non-reclining chair and a bowl of water didn't work out too well. It was SO uncomfortable. I had to really use my leg muscles to hold myself upright with my feet in the bowl. \n\nFor the out of the water stuff, they have you rest your foot on the nail person's thigh which I was really uncomfortable doing, not just because I had to assume an awkward position due to the chair, but also because I was resting on someone's thigh that was awkwardly hunched over to do my nails... \n\nThe massage was sub-par, and the actual treatment of my nails was really really sub-par. She got nail polish on my skin and did not remove it, and used some low quality top coat (certainly not OPI or any of the standard polishes), and it wasn't shiney at all. The coat started chipping off in 2 weeks, which was fine because it gave me an excuse to get a new pedicure as this one never looked good in the first place.\n\nThe ambiance was also WEIRD. If you stereotype tacky tacky Las Vegas, this is it. It sort of tried to go for a black and red, quasi movie star, pseudo edgy decor, but it failed on all fronts and just looked tacky, right down to the red carpet in front of the door. The lighting in the room where they did the pedicures was so low that I honestly could not even clearly see the color I was selecting for my nails. \n\nI'll stick with Asian-run places in the future. And for $60?? I pay half that back in Boston for a far better pedi, and I'm sure I can find a far better pedi for a far better price in Vegas too. Heck, I'll pay the $75 or $80 at the Cosmopolitan salon just for an experience worth paying for, because I probably would've gotten more for my $60 if I stuck it in a slot machine than paying for that awful pedicure."
1,"What a great new bar to have in the area. Went in last night with some friends for the first time and it was great.\n\nAlthough the beer selection isn't he biggest the low prices make up for it, although the kilt lifter was out and they didn't have a replacement keg. Additionally the $1 mystery shot is a great concept, just don't end up with the cow balls. Also the bartender was great, hooked us up with some cheap beers and was a fun person to chat with. \n\nThe food is also great and cheap. I had the burger and for $5 you can't get a better burger anywhere. My friends had the Sonoran dog and pickles and they both said they were great. \n\nFinally the real draw, for us at least, were the arcade games. There are about 15 games in there ranging from $0.25-$1 but unfortunately a few of them were out of order or working poorly. Also the quarter machine ran out of quarters!  \n\nIf the few kinks get worked out, which I'm sure they will this place will get a 5 star review shortly. Will be back soon!"

0,"I have given this restaurant 3 chances. Every single time I have been disappointed with their service. Gratuity on parties of 6 or more makes these waiters really lack in their game. Come on guys, get it together."
1,"Awesome brisket and great, fast service. Will be coming back next time we have a hankering for bbq."
1,Good dining experience.  We had Brittany as our server and she definitely went above and beyond to make the experience a memorable one!  The view of the strip is great and the food is delicious with a good presentation.
1,Great workout! I Great staff. They are very friendly and helpful. I love that it is close to my house and that the hours work with my schedule.
0,"Just horrible. I went here for a simple hair cut: 3 on top, 1 on the sides. I've had that style hundreds of times and rarely have I had a little problem with my hair cut, but this took the cake. \n\nThis was my first time going to this barber shop and little did I know what awaited me. I walked in and took a seat; there were 3 barbers there, one was busy giving a cut, the youngest one was busy organizing his work space, and the third one was sitting on his @@@ playing video games. And who called me to his chair? The one not doing anything constructive playing video games? No. The real young one. He looked to be fresh out of high school and as I sat down I thought how interesting it was that I had never had a cut from someone younger than me and how much of a barber prodigy this kid must be if he's already licenced to give hair cuts (little did I know). Assuming that he was simply a young licensed barber was a mistake. \n\nHe didn't even know how to work the powdered brush! He took the brush and barely, half-heartedly tapped only the tip of my nose. I had already closed my eyes with anticipation that he would brush off my whole face. A few seconds after I felt a little tap of the brush on my nose I quizzically opened my eyes thinking...um, OK. At that point I wasn't facing any mirrior and I couldn't see, but when he turned me toward one, I had so much hair on my face I looked like freaking Chewbacca! It was only then that he took an air hose to my face. Whatever happened to the little brush? He obviously realized he doesn't know how to use one. A few minutes later he poked me in the eye with his pinky! It was just a light tap, but it was the first time I had ever gotten poked in the eye while getting a hair cut. I could tell by his facial expression that he realized what had happened, and he didn't even apologize. The hair cut itself....oh boy. Since I was in kind of a hurry and still assuming he was a barber child prodigy who simply had issues with using a brush, I didn't see anything wrong with my hair when he held the mirror up for a second for me to see. \n\nWhen I got home I discovered the truth. The kid used some sort of clip that makes your hair look more thinned out, almost as if you were going bald. I did not request for him to cut my hair like this. During lunch even my buddy said \""I can see your head\"", at the moment I just assumed it was another way for him to say \""oh cool, you got a haircut\"". Not only did I get an eye poked and was already aging and losing my hair, but the sides of my head weren't just a 1 like I requested, there were patches of 1, 1 and 1/2, 2, and everything in between. Apart from my hair looking thinned out, it was uneven! My assumption about that young barber was wrong. \n\nHe doesn't know how to give a simple cut. I didn't even ask for a fade or line up. I just wonder what would have happened If I had requested both. Crooked line....instead of a fade it would of been a complete shave. If he doesn't know how to give a hair cut, what is he doing there? It's obvious he's not licenced. From what I know, if you are a *trained* barber who is waiting for his license to arrive you can give haircuts at a barber shop, but *cannot* charge a penny for it; its not permitted. I don't know how many ginnie pig's haircuts he's experimented on, but I hope that someone that got a bad cut and noticed the crap job he did before leaving the chair, complained. It's safe to say I'll never go there again. Tip? Tip my @@@.......I was in a hurry and forgot to tip anyway; good thing I didn't."
0,"Our AC went out last Saturday in 102 degree heat - called the 'emergency number' and never got a response.  Tried to call the number on Sunday and again, no one called us back.  Makes me wonder if they even check the number.  It took several calls on Monday to even reach a person in the office.\nIt took 6 days to get the AC 'fixed', only to have it break the next week - at the start of the fourth of July weekend.  Its now 110 degrees outside, Let's take bets on how long it takes for them to fix it this time.\nJust tried the emergency number, but I don't even expect a response...\n\n6 days to fix a major emergency I my home, by the end of this second issue, we will be almost two weeks without AC- but let me be late on my rent one day and see how much they charge me.\n\nRidiculous"
1,we stayed here for 2 days. 5 stars for peaceful place. 5 star for staff friendliness. 5 star for the location (close to almost every place you want to go in the strip). 5 star for NO incidentals deposits on standard rooms.  5 star for almost everything.. I love our stay in treasure island.
1,"I gave this to my fiance as a belated Birthday gift.  We had a great time.  Pete was fun, personable, and a very patient teacher.  He even let us sail longer than the two hours since it was the end of the day.  My fiance had a ball.  At one point the wind was so strong, he and a couple of other guys were trying to race the cars running along I-15!  Definitely would love to do this again and will recommend everyone to give it a try if you like speed and the wind on your face."
0,"Second time at this place and the food is just lack luster as last time. The Piled High Nachos were dry as a bone and the chips were burnt! The small amount of cheese they provided had solidified by the time they got to the table. The shredded beef tasted of nothing and was dried the f**k out! How could they screw up such a simple dish. I'm trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at. I told them to take it back. I won't even get into the service it wasn't terrible, but why bother.\n\nI'm coming to realize that  Mexican food served on the Vegas Strip does not do any one any favors. Everyone thinks Mexican food should be good, priced fairly and served in an adequate portion. Fast service and free chips and salsa are just par for the course. El Segundo Sol never scores high in any of the categories. Ever!\n\nI heard of a happy hour and the bartender said it's only outside at Stripburger (same company) in the cold, dreary rain. She actually recommended we sit outside in the cold rain by heat lamps! What's wrong with people?"
1,"The coffee rubbed short rib here KICKS ASS. Great food, great little find in Scottsdale."
1,"Hooray, downstairs is finally open!! The basement is quiet & cosy with ample seating. The bar isn't open down here yet so you wait for your drink before heading down but that's no biggie when the lattes are so fabulous!\nThe chirpy staff are the icing on the carrot cake :-)"
1,"We went to Harris Grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of town-and it was fun! The menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining. The food and drinks are moderately priced, and there is a nice selection of brews.\n\nWhat we had:\n\nTurkey Burger-fabulous-we agreed this was the best thing we had ( I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good)\n\nFlat Iron Pork-I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak-this was ok but I wouldn't get it again.\n\nSome Spicy Chicken sandwich-Pretty good-paled in comparison to the turkey burger\n\nTots-Delicious\n\nBeer-good! (duh)\n\nOther:\nService-Fab!\n\n2 Patios-front and back"
1,"Much was said about the service (or lack thereof), and while it turned me off while waiting half an hour for our orders, the quality of food is unbelievably outstanding that my initial 2 star rating was instantaneously bumped to a 4. That's how good this restaurant is. Braised sea bass with tofu, are you kidding me? Soooo delicate & exquisitely prepared. The pan fried Singapore noodles was also a hit, just the right mix of authenticity and yumminess to the untrained palate. This place calls for a repeat!"
0,"We came in again last Saturday. The food was fine but the service was terrible. We had a server who was very pale, pinkish blonde hair, and didn't smile. We aren't too picky and didn't care that much that we had to wave her over for things like water and coffee. We were more interested in enjoying our company but what I do have a problem with is getting orders wrong TWICE and not comping my roommates meal. She is lactose intolerant and gluten free so eating out can be stressful but breakfast is really easy. She ordered the chorizo scramble and wanted bacon added and no cheese. SO EASY. It came to her with NO BACON and EXTRA cheese. She sent it back. It came back with no cheese and NO BACON. She was so hungry at this point and we had finished eating so she just didn't say anything. I said something because it's ridiculous. I don't even think the woman apologized. When I mentioned she again did not get the bacon the woman just gave her a side. Not the same as having it in the scramble as she asked for. Twice at this point.\n\nYou guys should not have charged her for the meal and certainly should not have charged her EXTRA for the very late bacon. I think I am giving up on saturday brunch at Bliss Rebar. So many other places get the customer service AND the food right."
0,"Disapointment! Honestly can't say anything good about the place. \n\nThe food was bad, even for a buffet. Most of the juice machines where down. Fruit wasn't ripe. How do mess up fried chicken and mashed potatoes. On top of all that, most of the ladels had food on them so my hands were left sticky and gross. On top of that, it was over priced."
1,"La Santisima has a great variety of Mexican foods from many different regions of mexico, with a depth and richness of flavor that is absolutely amazing. Their happy hour is extraordinarily reasonable, but one of my favorite things is the salsa bar. Around 20 salsas with a variety of flavors and ingredients, from a pecan salsa, to old standbys like pico de gallo. I would highly recommend this restaurant to ANYONE, and have brought folks visiting from out of town. Everyone agrees, this is the best of the best.\n\nP.S. The place is definitely cozy. I would recommend coming in during happy hours if you are trying to avoid a crowd."
0,"I still live here and want to move since our lease is coming to an end.  Everytime it rains my freakin roof leaks in a different spot.  Apon scrubbing my bathtub with a scrub brush instead of my normal scrub pad i found that my bathtub was painted because paint came off of the bathtub.  3 of my neighbors cars were vandalized (windows busted) in one night, my house constantly smells like weed because of my neighbors, because of that little crack that i can see into my neighbors apartment in the laundry room door area, even though I signed a year lease I still have to give 60 days notice to move out...how am I supposed to find a place with 60 days...noone is going to hold a place for me for 60 days, they have raised the rent, and gotten even more rude, they handed me a pre-eviction notice and I had paid my rent just appearently there was a new girl and she did that to about 10 other tenants the same day, I overheard the maintanance talking about how someone had had their dog in the pool because the pool wasnt being properly filtered because the dog hair clogged it but didnt shut the pool down for cleaning...my little kids swam in that pool everyday before I heard that, the sprinklers are set all funky so they spray the sidewalk more than the grass so when the sprinklers are on I have to run past them, but when the sidewalk is wet its slippery so I have to run without falling, and the list goes on and on!"
0,"Horrible horrible.   have been there ten times or more when it was trophys.  was hoping it would be the same great food... But I was wrong.   Paid 27 bucks force steak that had no flavor that came with veggies that had no seasoning.   Did I mention it was 27 bucks and did not even come with a salad.   You would get more steak if you ordered two kids meal steaks and had that as your meal.     Used to be a huge fan of the place, but we won't be back unless I hear they made some changed."
0,"DO NOT try their samples. Take it from an insider, they do not thoroughly clean the containers. \n\nThe tea itself is okay. However, Teavana does not specialize in high quality loose-leaf tea. In fact, you can find better quality tea online for more reasonable prices. It's unfortunate that the company has chosen to push for ingredients that mask the flavor of tea. They used to sell really good green and white teas. Now all the green and whites taste just like their herbals. There is no clear distinction, other than the fact that they are more expensive and supposedly \""higher quality\"".\n\nTea connoisseurs would be very disappointed with Teavana's \""teas\""."
0,Fair.  I went here with my family and would not return again.\n\nWisconsin does much better in this category.\n\nTry somewhere else.
0,"Had the worst experience of my life at this location. Showed up and got \""in line\"" to watch a UFC event @ 3:30. We were told people in line will start being let in at 4:30. As the time approached 5:00 there were at least 50 people in line and no one going in.  Several people kept going in to ask when we would be going in, and each one got a different answer. The event started @ 5:00 and at 5:15 many of us were still outside and very irritated. There were a few people who got tired of the wait and left. One person went in just before 5:30 to get an update and witnessed the Manager giving a \""pep talk\"" which was more like a chewing out of employees. The mgr did in no way seem to be professional and seemed to not care that there was line of people outside all waiting to see an event that had already started. When people finally started going in at approximately 5:30 the Mgr at one point stopped and said \""in the last 10 minutes I have let in approximately 25 people, we have to stop or we're going to kill our kitchen\"" She at no point explained to the people waiting what the hold up was, or even apologize for the delay. The food was ok, nothing to brag about. The chips & salsa were bland, definitely wouldn't order that again. We were seated at a corner table, and as the building became full and obviously no one else could fit, they let all the remaining people stand in the lobby. From our view a few of the standing people were blocking views of the tv's.  We even at some point asked them to move over so we could see, and after multiple requests we had to call our server to help us with this. Bottom line of this was they were more concerned with serving those standing people beverages then the customers sitting at tables. One of the worst showings of customer service and me and the group I was with will never go there again."
0,"Dear Albert,\n\nI appreciate your offer but, here's the thing... I'm reading other reviews and they all seem to think the same. First impressions are the only thing that matters. I didn't even get into the total and complete disorganization of player card services. Although, I did stop one of the wandering hosts and he told me some things about the way sls is being ran, he led me into a tornado. First he led me to player card services ( I think ) to where the guy sitting at the desk asked for my ID. He walked off with it and not until I realized I was sitting for a long time and got up to find him, he was standing in the room behind me talking with another employee. Obviously not the kind of 'great service I want to give another try.' Even worse is that when he noticed me looking for him, he directed me to the high limit card services. They were even more clueless then he was. The pretty girl working the high limit has to call a supervisor to... Make a card??? And even THE MANAGER didn't know and took her several tries to produce one. Believe me, I know all about opening new establishments. I opened the Hilton in San Diego as a chef. Same kind of thing. Working there I was really let down because I thought a big name like Hilton (sunstone/Blackstone) would be organized. Fortunately for that particular location, they have the convention center right next door that pretty much guarantees certain capacity. \n\nHaving such a bad location and poor choice in building, I can't imagine much change. Unless, they completely change the entrance and layout??? Hate to break it to you but whomever redesigned the construction should be fired. Just a nightmare and unless machines actually pay or 'Hired' guests ( to appear like it's a hot place) are actually more friendly... ( I saw two petty girls sitting by the Roger Moore photo and said hello when I was quickly cut off by some big guys telling me they were their property. Probably body guards, I'm guessing, but, not the kind of feeling I want trying to enjoy myself )\n\nNot sure what you could offer that would change my mind.\n\nI brought up the Hilton because to me it seems like the same thing. The owners are relying on the place itself instead of hiring quality employees that are worth their pay. The Hilton has the convention center... What does sls have?"
0,"Came a second time- was lied to again-\nWas told I didn't need brakes(which was a lie) and instead I need something electrical done because I didn't need a bulb for the brake lights(he claimed he checked)\nSo i went and asked some guy at work- he was nice to check the issue out for me. I did need brakes and my bulbs did need to get replaced for the brake light- nothing electrical need to be done.(What is up with these jerks always trying to ripe off women) So the jerk is basically lying to folks.   I believe in karma, and when you do wrong then you will get yours. On that note if the store hours is posted at  6:00pm ,and I show up at 5:25pm then you need to cut off the lights since you are in a rush to get home."
1,"Pumpkin pie cream ice is deelish, this is way better than the Rita's I remember back in Philly!!! They don't have all the options available on the website (like no Slendaritas) but the workers were all really nice and patient and let us sample flavor after flavor. Finally I decided on the pumpkins pie and knew I had to come back soon to try all the others. They have yummy custards too and kiddie sizes/sugar free options, if you're watching calories. A very good, cheap treat, this is definitely going to be a popular spot!!"
1,Pizzas good.. beer is cold and the games work great. Fun for all and easy on the wallet.
1,"My favorite froyo place ever!!!!  They literally have the best tart yogurt I've ever had.  I've been to Golden Spoon, Yogurtland, Redmango, Icetango...but they do not compare to YB!!  They are really innovative with their ever changing flavors."
0,"I sometimes wonder how this place is still open because its such a dump and I'm aghast at how this place hasn't received a significant makeover like most of the other hotels on the strip.  Now that its part of the Harrah's chain, I figured something would have been done, but it still remains as the Imperial Dump.\n\nIt only took one stay for me to realize I don't ever want to come back.  My hotel room had this eerie smell and when I had switched to another room, it still had some sort of a fish smell stained into the carpet.  This was something Fabreeze could never get out.  Bathrooms in the tub room were semi-disgusting and the closets always made me think there was a dead body somewhere in the walls.  The cleaning ladies told me they were aware of this, they even mentioned that nothing can be done.\n\nMy friends got sick here from earlier experiences at the Emperor's Buffet, which may very well be the cheapest on the strip ($15 for adults on dinner!).  For the only Asian themed casino on the strip, its a shame MIng's happens to be the only Asian themed restaurant amongst the American burger / pizza joints they have in their collection.\n\nI know a renovation will be scheduled eventually.  It's in such a great location on the strip and the prices are too good for a lot of cheapskates to pass up.  But until the changes happen, it will remain as the Imperial Poophouse."
0,"went after reading positive reviews and craving authentic mexican food. BUT this was HORRIBLE. Staples like chips and salsa were stale and bland respectively. But to make matters worse, my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever. The chicken was fried to the point that I could not chew it, and the veggies were covered in grease, and the whole thing was cooked in Soy Sauce! Is that traditional?? It was a nasty overall experience..."
1,"Grampa, you've won me over.  While we had a tough go of it on my first visit, on my three subsequent interactions, you have knocked it out of the park.  I experienced the Brassacre pizza twice during the 2014 March Madness #PizzaBracket extravaganza and this pizza met, nay, exceeded my lofty expectations.  Grampa's definitely has addressed the issues with the crust that vexed me during my initial visit.  The pizza crust on the Brassacre was truly special, with the proper proportions of bite and chew and SERIOUS flavor.   The toppings were equally impressive; the caramelized exterior on the brussels sprouts gave the pizza a hint of sweetness to balance the smoky, slightly salted righteousness that came with the perfectly rendered Nueske's bacon.  One bite and I knew I was in the presence of pizza perfection.  The Goomba and Jabroni pizzas are also culinary wonders.  Despite the service hiccups experienced during my first visit, the quality of the pizzas certainly warrants a five star rating."
0,"All the food here is reheated right in front of you. However, I would be able to overlook that if the food tasted decent. I love pasta and don't know how you can go wrong with baked ziti, but somehow they did. It was bland and the noodles were overcooked. Terrible."
0,"The atmosphere is decent, but the food is absolutely terrible.  It is nothing but chewy meat covered in cheap cheese and grease.   The quesadillas are served in a pool of grease and the nachos are some of the worst in Phoenix,  The quality is an insult to the prices charged and an affront to good Mexican food.  Stick with the beer."
1,Food was fantastic! I highly recommend the Spicy Turkey Wrap and Mac and Cheese! Loved them! Will definitely come back!!
1,"This was a great room at a great price. We stayed on Saturday and Sunday night at an average rate of $72 per night on the first weekend in August. This is not the classiest or biggest casino/ hotel on the strip, but the amenities are perfect. They have decent gambling, great pools, a few nice dining options, and a comedy club. The comedy club was perfect for our party of 15. The bars in the casino serve good drinks at a good price and the rooms are comfortable for the after party. The location is perfect. We were at the MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, New York NY, and Mandalay Bay in minutes. Have fun!"
1,"This is a great \""Hotel Only\"" hotel in Las Vegas.  It is very modern in its design and I cannot remember a better night's sleep.  The rooms are fantastic with 2 TV's living space, kitchen, and a very large bathroom.  The hotel is right next door to the Bellagio but it is somewhat of a walk to get there.  If you are looking for food...good luck...they have a restaurant downstairs but the quick bites are not around.  Overall, a great experience even though I am writing this review based on my stay 1-2 years ago."
1,"Simply put lunch was great... and a bargain... Trays were kept full and fresh... a woman watched the trays and radioed the kitchen what was needed,  Many items not normally seen on a buffet,,,    I even tried chicken feet,,,,,  also you should try the green tea ice cream.  I will be back anytime I am in the area!"
1,Excellent coffee. They always have a select coffee brewed but also offer a variety of specialty coffees hand poured by the cup. I'll definitely make it a point to stop back next time I'm in Pittsburgh.
0,"When they first opened, the food was good, but then it went downhill.\nTheir food is not fresh and every dish is socking with bad oil. \nNot authentic at all since I am from Szechuan, I know how my hometown food taste like. I can cook much better Szechuan dish at home  . Disappointed...."
1,"LOVE this place. Traditional Mexican food, family owned.  Food is awesome, Phoenix Metro Area has lost many of it's family owned Traditional Mexican Restaurants and we were so happy to find Los Taquitos.  Frequent here often.  The pazole soup is one of my favorite dishes, homemade, chunky, just enough spice.  The menu has plenty to choose from & the prices are reasonable.  \nWe ordered at the counter & it wasn't long before they served us a delicious, hot meal.  Atmosphere is very Sonoran Mexico as well.  If you want good Mexican food, Mexico style, go here.  We give this place & frequent it often ...  a double thumbs up."
0,"I will never shop in this mall again due to their security, I was there a couple weeks ago when a fight among 7 people broke out and it took their security over 10 min to show up (yes, the fight lasted a while) and only one security guard showed up that I could visibly see.  When I went to their main office to complain I was told that it was due to their shift change...WTH, what if one of the people fighting had a gun???  I DID NOT FEEL SAFE"
1,"I was admittedly nervous about everything to do with purchasing a new home and especially having it financed with all of the new restrictions in today's market. However, Matt Baker made it truly simple and precise. I can not begin to express how knowledgeable and professional he is throughout the whole process. I would and do whole-heartedly recommend Matt and his team to any and all of my friends and business partners. Thank you Matt!\nGreg P."
1,"Hands down best club in vegas. Don't bother by looking elsewhere, this is where you need to be if your planning a night out. It's very upscale, the crowd is hot and the music is exactly what we were looking for. However, it's very expensive, 35$ admission, 10$ coat check, and 11+ for drinks. Bottles start at 450$. Still great scene."
0,"Please note this review is for the salon NOT the stylists. \n\nFrom the salon perspective I have had multiple poor customer service experiences, below I will list the two most prominent. \n\nI have been going to this salon for a little over a year and have only amazing things to say about every stylist I have encountered. As such I have recommended most my family and coworkers to go here. That being said; the customer service from a receptionist perspective has been fairly poor all around. There are particularly 2 incidents which led to this review and the 3rd being that they discourage leaving a tip for the stylist on a card and actually ask you to bring cash (seems fishy and in bad taste).\n\n1. I had made an appointment on a day in which I was flying out of town for work and was on a tight schedule. I arrived a few min early but basically right on time. The receptionist (i don't recall her name) just looked back and said \""oh your stylist is out, she should be back shortly\"". I then sat in the lobby for 15 min waiting when my stylist walked out from the back and greeted me and said she had been waiting but no one told her I was there. This was true because the receptionist didn't even leave the seat to check.\n\n2. For my mother birthday / mothers day I wanted to treat her to a spa day. I called ahead and asked if I could purchase a gift certificate online or over the phone so that she could come in and get her hair done. When speaking with the receptionist I was told that I couldn't purchase it online so she would make a not on the account and they would call me for payment when she completed. Giving my mother this info she didn't take any payment with her when she went to get her hair done, assuming that is was taken care of. After the cut was complete she was left embarrassed now that she couldn't pay at the time. I spoke to the salon manager and explained the scenario who told me \""oh well they gave you wrong info she needs to pay\"". After a short discussion I assured them she would be back. Needless to say this turned in to multiple trips to the salon plus the embarrassment she faced. \n\nNot only did this second scenario ruin what was to be a nice thing it he even asked her to leave collateral. It was quite offensive and IMO in poor judgment given there mistake. \n\nAll in all. Stylists are great - owners / managers / receptionists - thumbs down."
0,I just went into the establishment and was immediately denied service.  I had to greet the associates first and was then told they did not have time for me. They did not ask if I could come at a later time or if they'd be available later in the day. I have never gone to any nail salon & they not want my business for no apparent reason. No bueno!
1,"Best massage ever! Be sure to ask for Ellen, she is knowledgeable and passionate about massage!!"
1,"I'm hooked!!! I use YELP a lot. However, OPEN TABLE sent me a NEW restaurant open thing. So, me & my woman went to check it out. I was back the next day!!! Enough said! Lol people check this place out. I know it's a rule of thumb to wait about 6-months before going into a fairly new place...so the can get the kinks out. Just go I think you'll love it. ENTERTAINMENT for sure"
1,Sesame Inn was the place we went when we wanted Chinese food when I was growing up in Pittsburgh. My family owned a Chinese restaurant themselves and when they wanted Chinese food this is where we went. I remember the walnut chicken and the orange beef the most. What I would give to have some. The dumplings were also a favorite of mine too!! Just another place I will be sure to visit when I travel back to the Burgh.
1,"Oh Plaza Midwood, you and your silly reverse parking. I don't really understand you. However, I will endure it to come visit the Diamond.\n\nYes, it's always slammed. Yes, you may have to wait for a table. Yes, it is completely worth it. (and you never have to wait all that long)\n\nMust get app: pig wings. I know, it sounds kind of weird. They are DELICIOUS. Fried pickles and gravy fries are also good. Make sure to add pimento to the fries.\n\nA little bit of everything on this menu. Think comfort food. I like the burgers, open face hot turkey sandwich and grilled pork chops. Great side item choices for veggie plates. A lot of people rave about the veggie meatloaf. I need to try this sometime to see what the fuss is all about. \n\nFull bar. Good beer selection. They had mimosas on special Sunday. My roommate and I couldn't drink ours because the champagne was flat. Not sure what was going on there. \n\nDiverse crowd. Super laid back and chill atmosphere. The patio is great for people watching in the neighborhood."
0,"Hopefully you never get Erica as a server. She was very rude, rushed, and does not know the golden rule. She argues when questioned. I think because we all look younger she thought we wouldn't tip well, her mistake. \nWILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CHILIES!"
1,Great food.  We loved the rolls!  I got the Country Fried Chicken (which was amazing) and my wife got a HUGE steak!  The food was so awesome!
1,"What can be said about Caps' Bobby? Everything, it's my favorite all time sandwich! It's the best. This location has very friendly people and it's always clean and nice. We always stop by here on our way out of town and they have no problem with making my wife her special sandwich."
0,"One experience can ruin an entire place. Tonight was that experience for Lee's Korean BBQ (Woonam Jung). Not only was the service terrible, but I felt genuinely discriminated against. \n\nWhen my roommate and I walked inside, I noticed that the restaurant was busy, so while I was prepared to wait a minute, I was not prepared to be completely ignored by the hostess while she ran from behind the register to deliver something to a table. I figured she would at least acknowledge us upon returning, but instead she went to the kitchen for a few minutes before finally greeting us, which was a relief, since I was starting to think that I had somehow managed to turn invisible. She told us that it would be about ten minutes, and then we sat in the little waiting chairs. \n\nAbout five minutes later, another party came in. This was a party of three. They sat down next to us to wait as well. Somewhere between five and ten minutes later, a second party of two entered and stood at the counter. At this point, the hostess says something while gesturing toward a table. Logic dictating that since we were the first arrival, we would be the ones to be seated, I stood and took a step. The hostess quickly shattered the notion with a halting gesture while ushering in the party of three. \n\nThe party that arrived five minutes after me. \n\nI got angry for a moment, but my roommate pointed out that maybe they seated the party of three first because a larger table was ready first. Grudgingly calmed for a moment, I settled back into my seat. Of course, when the waitress returned and seated the pair of gentlemen that entered AT LEAST ten minutes after us, I may have had a minor meltdown. \n\nI explained to the manager that there was a chance that her restaurant may just be kind of busy and extremely disorganized, but it kind of felt more like we were ignored because we were the only one of the parties that greeted the hostess in English rather than Korean. \n\nAny rational human being probably would have left by this point, but this had become a matter of principle. The manager apologized profusely, and my roommate and I followed the hostess to our table. \n\nGods below, I wish I were a more rational human being. At least the waitress got our first order of meats correct, and didn't bring something completely unwanted to the table. Meanwhile, the bean paste soup was the first item I had ordered. After three attempts, it was the last item to arrive. Our drink order took two tries, as did our request for hot sauce. And refills? Yeah, if I would have held my breath I would probably be typing this from the beyond. None to be had. I shudder to imagine how this would have went if not for the poor girl bussing tables. Even she was practically ignored when she attempted to bring the waitress back to our table. \n\nAfter waiting ten minutes for our check, I quickly paid and gave far more gratuity than was remotely deserved and got out of the place as fast as possible. \n\nFrom now on, I'll take my business elsewhere."
0,"Went there because I'm new in town and  I'm a chicken wing, pizza and gyro connoisseur.  They have all 3 there.   I ordered a gyro ($4.50 alone or $5.00 for the combo) and wings  ($7.95).  The total came to $15.95 so I stopped the guy and mentioned this. He said the 2 sides of blue cheese was 1 dollar a piece!  I was flabbergasted.  I mentioned that NO WHERE have I ever been would they charge you 1 dollar a piece!  And they were small sides (1 heaping t-spoon).  I would pay 75 cents for a side at Genos's in Tempe for 3 times that amount of BC (needed for big orders).  Get this though, the guy will charge you 50 cents for substituting blue cheese for the regular side of ranch - because it cost more.  Seriously, 10 cc's of blue cheese is something that is too much to include with meal as every other plae that I have ever been to will?  Needless to say I cancelled my order.   I wonder, was it really worth it for him to lose that business, AND future business?  \n\nAs I was driving home, I thought about the 50 cents increase for the special.  I chose a can of coke instead of the fries.  But here's the math:  By his logic, the two small sides of blue cheese cost more than 4 cans of coke or 4 orders of fries (0.50 X 4  = the $2.00 for the sides of BC).  Crazy.\n\nI may go back for the gryo because it's on my way to school and back, and just around the corner, and it wasn't bad.  In a pinch will hit the spot, but it won't be regularly I can tell you that.  He could have had a customer a couple times a week and one that bought more than just a gryo being that I love wings and pizza as well.  Not just that, buy my roommate and I tend to eat out at the same place.  The guy definitely needs better business sense and customer service appreciation.\n\n3 stars for the gryo\n1 star for the blue cheese charge"
1,"Great little place for date night! LAMP Pizzeria definitely has the nicest \""fancy\"" pizza in the Cave Creek/North Scottsdale area. It's wood fired and they use quality ingredients. Is it the best pizza I've every had, or even in the Top 5? No, but for the area, it's a fantastic choice and I definitely will be bringing family who visit here and going back for dinners with my husband. \n\nThe white wine sangria was fun and came full of fruit (grapes & oranges). I really liked the Grape & Gorgonzola salad because it was big, fresh, and filling. My husband and I split The Simple pizza and really liked it - good crust, good sauce, good cheese, good olive oil. Two drinks each, a salad, and a pizza runs about $50.\n\nThe place is cute. We sat outside, and though it's in a strip mall, the patio is in a courtyard setting with big string lights above. Wish they could get misters out there for the summer, but they have heat lamps for cooler nights. The courtyard faces west so you can see the sky change colors as the sun sets. The only bummer is that they don't have cocktails, but there is a place right next door that serves those."
0,"We came to Vegas for a friend's birthday celebration and chose Morels for her surprise birthday dinner.  All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).  \n\nThe service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.\n\nWe ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.\n\nThe bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.\n\nAll in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here."
1,"They serve apple pancakes here that are pretty special. It's an innovative baked creation. \n\n\nThen again, this place does things a little differently. Not like IHOP. \n\n\nI highly recommend the cherry crepes.... And I don't even like cherries. They just taste amazing!!"
1,Master Lock and Security... EPIC! \n\nSomehow I just was so damn clumsy with my keys. Tried to pack everything in my trunk and forgot my keys were also in my hand. Threw the keys in the trunk and shut the door. \n\n\nBlah this is like the 3rd time I have ever done this. Always a pain in the ass. \n\n\nAll in all... Very fast service ... Got everything done in about 2 minutes. Great stuff and if you have a similar issue like I did.. Don't hesitate to give them a call!
1,"The food is outstanding, as well as the service!"
1,"Ordered Boustan's three times during my week-long visit to Montreal and I can't say anything but good things about this restaurant. First and foremost, they DELIVER - and quickly too! I ordered the chicken schwarma plate all three times. The chicken is nice and tender and the hummus is to die for! I'm from California and I'd much rather have Boustan's late-night than an order of carne asada fries (and that's saying something!)"
0,"ROBBED!!! My brother and his girlfriend checked in, dropped off their things, went and had dinner, came back, opened the door and ALL their bags were gone! There was NO forced entry so either someone who worked at the hotel, or a negligent staff that allowed an old room key to work!!! Beware!!!!!!"
1,"OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!"
0,"We had dinner there last night and were disappointed.  The food was okay - sort of on the bland side.  Had a marguerita that I had to send back because it had absolutely no taste.  The artichokes were just ok, as was the pizza I ordered.  My husband had halibut stuffed with salmon mousse and spinach - it was swimming in sauce and you wouldn't even know if it was fish or chicken.  We'd been looking forward to trying this place.  Won't go back again."
0,"I went to Maiya's today for a pedicure. They said the price would be $20 for a pedi. I got to Maiya and it was packed. I sat down in the chair and it was hot out and really wanted a water and usually nail salons ask if you would like a water. I was surprise they didn't. Then I got my pedi and the chairs are very close together and a customer notice my Coach pocketbook was setting in a puddle of water. I was very upset the foot sink must of been leaking. The customer was more concern then the nail technician she continue with the pedi and I was furious. I didn't want to make a scene so I just let her finish the pedi. When I went to pay she said $25 I asked why since they said $20 and she said because it was  french manicure. You think they would tell you that when you ask. Also, during the pedi she asked if I wanted scrubbing gel  to smooth my skin and that was extra $5. I never had a nail place trying to make me buy add on when doing my feet. and then she told me to seat there and she will be back to put on the shoes. She started to doing some one else never came back. After 15 minutes i took the tow separators off and put myself and put my shoes on and left. I don't know if I just had an bad experience but I will not be returning. The place was really pack so alot people must enjoy it there."
0,"The vast chasm between the 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews of this place is very interesting... but my one and only experience with this place is ZERO stars. \nI ordered sushi for delivery, and it arrived quickly, but the order was made incorrectly-- didn't even come close to matching the menu description. No avocado, no green onion, AND no cucumber in the roll, and the wrong sauce. This was an expensive fancy roll with only 2 of the 5 listed things inside and a massive amount of rice to make it look big. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know, and the \""owner\"" (she insisted she was the owner) spent 11 minutes telling me \""that's just how we make it now\"" ... I explained that the roll was far from matching the menu description, didn't contain the full value of ingredients I had paid for, and that this situation needed to be fixed. She literally just kept saying \""that's how we make it now\"" and for a while tried the tactic of telling me that there WAS avocado on it, I just couldn't see it bc it was such a small slice.... yeah... there was not avocado anywhere in or on the roll. I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but she said she was the owner. So then I asked for her name and she straight-up refused to give me her name, numerous times. I finally realized I was arguing with an actual insane person, so I gave up. If you're ever thinking of ordering from here, just throw $15 into the trash instead."
0,"Where do I begin on this crap fest?  I read some of the other reviews to this place and it's about the same poop, but a different day.\n\nMy wife comes from a large Italian family.  We know our Italian.  This my friend is NOT Italian.  The decor was nice, but almost every Italian joint has nice decor.  The menu looked great.  We were so excited.\n\nMy wife and I were STARVING when we got in.  We were happy we got seated right away.  They brought out fresh rolls right away and they were delicious.  It's the only reason this place is getting their 1 star.\nWe got our appetizer of calamari and it was disgusting.  I took a bite and couldn't eat anymore.  My wife was so hungry, she ate it all.  She didn't care.  She thought it was gross too.  The breading was finely grated and seemed like it was cooked in very old oil.  It smelled and tasted like yesterday's oil.  It made me pretty sick.\n\nI got Salmon and my wife got breaded chicken.  My salmon was smelly (very fishy) and overcooked.  Like a hockey puck.  The sauce on the pasta was exactly the sauce that came with the calamari, though our server insisted it was different.  My wife's chicken was topped with melted butter.  I am not sure what the sauce was supposed to be, but it was breaded chicken with melted butter.\n\nNeedless to say, we took one bite, sent it back and got our bill.  The interesting thing was our server was not suprised in the least bit.  We ordered what we ordered because our server suggested it.  He didn't ask why we were sending it back.  It was almost like this has already happened a few times so far this evening.  \n\nOverall, AVOID AT ALL COST.  The place is not cheap and you are not getting your money's worth."
0,"Old, dirty, unfriendly, unaccomadating. Never again, EVER! When we arrived for check in at 3:30 on Thursday we were told by a Michelle G, who checked us in, that there were were no longer any king size bedrooms available, which is what we had reserved. This left me to wonder whether the guests waiting in the gigantic and growing line behind me were going to be told the same thing and how pissed everyone was going to be, right? My husband asked how that was possible and the chick had the audacity to tell us that technically check is 3 but no one is guaranteed their room until 6 pm!! Seriously?! Then why isn't check in at 6?! That was ridiculous. She must've thought we were stupid or something. She treated us like second class citizens and this really disappointed me. Well after my husband refused to budge, she made a call and magically found a king size bedroom available. She took no responsibility, made no apologies and frankly looked mad at us for some reason! Talk about quality customer service, what a joke! Well she must have had some sort of beef with us because the room we got was awful! Ugly, drab, old and equivalent to a crappy holiday inn, even then that may be an insult to the holiday inn. The bathroom had mold and hard water stains, and small.  The furniture was chipped and dis colored and carpet was old. Mind you we're not pretentious or picky but even this was pretty bad for vegas! We called to complain but the hotel refused to take responsibility and said they'd call back to switch our rooms and never did. When we met up at our friend's room I noticed their room was bigger and newer and a tad better but even they weren't happy with their room. Never again will we make the mistake of staying here. The Monte Carlo claim that \""luxury should make you feel special no matter who you are\"" and that was a bunch of BS. I should've just stuck with the Mandalay bay or Luxor. Sorry for grammar and punctuation, I'm on my phone and mad!"
1,"Wonderful box. Staff was great, class was a lot of fun, and members were really friendly!"
0,"I really want to love this place, but I can't. The fries are great, the servers attractive and the food gets there fast, but the entrees aren't that great, bottle beer is $4 (that much for a miller lite at a sports bar? really?) and the servers, for whatever stupid, dumbass reason, refuse to split checks.\n\nThis does nothing but piss me off. I've never understood this practice. First of all, you're a sports bar. People genuinely come into sports bars in groups. We all ordered food, we all ordered drinks and it took nearly 25 minutes to figure out our goddamn bill at the end.\n\nAttention restaurant owners: MOST OF US DON'T CARRY CASH ANYMORE. Get with it and start splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups. There is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better tips."
0,Very disappointing.  I saw that there was something new and wanted to give it a try.  (I used to live in Pgh and am now visiting so I'm not sure how new it is)\n\nI ordered the pulled chicken sandwich.  It was very dry and not very flavorful at all.  The fries that came with it were okay but nothing special.  It is very apparent that this place is capitalizing on the their location in Market Square.\n\nWe did however sit outside and had a great view of PPG Place and Market Square.
1,"Great pizza - a bit pricey, but worth it. \nWe had the white pizza with cheese, and were blown away. Often times white pizzas are bland to say the least, but this pizza had a great mix of spices and quality cheeses that made it something special. We also got a house salad and garlic fries. If we only got the pizza this would have been a 5 star review, but the garlic fries were very basic, fries with minced garlic on top...nothing special. The service was great (you order at the counter) and the decor was pretty typical for a NY style pizzeria in Las Vegas. We will definitely hit this place up again and again."
1,"A prominent \""bridge\"" from Bellagio to Aria Hotel and Casino. It's my favorite spot in whole City Center now.\nHowever I checked web site and found out that The Cosmopolitan is not a part of City Center at all. In my opinion, it's organically synced with the rest of buildings and is an enticing addition to them. \nI'm staying there next time!\nAnd one more thing, check their packages on web. One I really suggest all my single but cooperative peers is \""Three adults for the price of two\"" night stay."
0,"One of the worst check in experiences at PHX, but very consistent with poor US Air check in processes across the country.  It is quite obvious that the layout designer and process engineer responsible for the check-in \""corral\"" have zero practical experience in queuing theory and capacity planning that strives to remove bottlenecks not exacerbate then.  The check in in experience is poor and an in effective use of US Air personnel,  which undoubtedly impacted my high ticket price."
0,I was really excited to hear about this place but when I went there I was disappointed. I was hoping for a really nice tea room or a cute little boho place. This was neither. It was hard surfaces and dank. I looked at the selection and didn't see anything that excited me- I have an really good selection at home. So...I went home and brewed myself a cup for a LOT less money.
1,Best American breakfast\nThe portions are enormous\nIf you like to eat this is the place.\nI never usually go to the same restaurant when I travel  but I am returning today I am curios to try other plates
1,"Yes, it's a chain.  Is it top of the line?  No.  But the quality has greatly improved over the years and the service as well.  They handle groups well.  This place is always on the list for my office to have lunch.  I recommend it."
0,"Went in to get dinner for the family service was great at first, Tyler help us immediately with taking our order. Then there was the usual kitchen banter while they were getting orders ready. \n\nThe manager came out and asked for grilled chicken. Ok fine you need food the nice kid Tyler that help us out turned into a punk and said out loud (for me and 2 other customers in the resturant to hear him) I've got it in you stupid b*tch. Then proceeded to repeat him self 2 more times. \n\nI promptly asked for my money back and I got an attitude from him and he stormed off to get the manager. When the manager came out I was in absolute shock that this little punk was cussing at his older female manager. I absolutley refuse to return to this location until the staff is changed."
1,"Best Italian food in Tempe.  Love the vibe!  So friendly.  Capellini is great, so is the Tiramisu.  Great wine list & good happy hour (before 6 pm) prices.  Oh yeah - also love the broccoli Stromboli."
0,"Worst balsamic dressing I've ever tasted.  Lettuce is stale.  Size is insulting - I ordered a \""large\"" and it's barely larger than a side salad you'd get at a fast food restaurant.  I will never go there again."
0,"While visiting Montreal we had to try persian food, knowing that in Canada there is such a big persian population. I don't know what I was thinking, but I thought that due to huge persian population, I expected better persian food than in all\n Persian restaurants in NYC, which had tried numerous times in the past ten years. \nParis's was worst persian restaurant ever! When we arrived and seated us and show have began....the waiter was nice, but it seemed that he must started working first day, was so disorganized, was jumping from table to table, seemed so lost. I ordered salmon kebab, and they said sorry we don't have it. My husband ordered soltani, which is main typical persian food (some beef kebab and beef skirt stake kebab), and he said that they don't have it to, it's even not in the menu. I was shocked! Later I have ordered shrimp kebab with green rice. And my husband ordered some beef steak. Omg, our food came out literally two hours later and I never seen the rice brought for me. The rice looked nothing like they supposed to, it was a mix of different rice colors and so oily and even had no peas in there. It looked nothing like suppose to. My husbands dish looked better, meat was soft but  I guarantee it had MSG in there, because my husband s allergic to MSG and the night we got home he had a severe allergic attack. What a disappointment and waste of time and money this place was! If you never tried persian food , maybe it will seem ok, but if you are familiar with persian cuisine , stay away of this place, this is nothing even close persian food. I been to all persian restaurants in entire east coast, but this  I would stay away from!!!"
1,"One of my favorite places to eat at the Venetian in Vegas! \n\nBecause I'm super bored, I shall recite a little poem for you:\n\nThe ambiance is sublime, \nand your food is simply divine.\n\nThe service can be a little slow, (-1 star)\nyou'll probably be so hungover you won't even know,\nor notice because the breakfast buffet,\nis probably cheaper than Mandalay Bay's.\n\nPastries, bacon, omelettes made before your eyes,\n\""Is this heaven?!\"" you start to cry.\n\""No!\"", I must disagree,\n\""You haven't even tried the fried buffalo rolls with cheese.\""\n\nThe restaurant is open 24/7,\nam or pm, come at 11!\nOr go to the side that's enclosed,\nand order your scrumptious food to go!"
1,"Having tried a few different Chinese restaurants for take aways, I tried China Palace and was really impressed. Great food and reasonable price. Best I've tasted in Edinburgh to date. Nice touch was choice of free dish with the meal (spring rolls or BBQ ribs). \n\nWill def. be using them again. Recommended."
1,"I tried Crunch out on a recent visit to the mall.  I have to say I wasn't expecting a whole lot from a healthy restaurant found within the food court of the mail, but I was presently surprised.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap (replacing the ranch with blue cheese) and it was delicious.  Although the wrap was a little pricier than some of the other food court options ($7+), it was delicious. I will definitely be visiting again."
1,Marveless Mark rocked!  Cool atmosphere! Great time! Waitress were very attentive and the performances were great. Gotta try the Marveless mark shot. And see the rock of ages show!
1,We went on a whim for my wife's 40th birthday with friends. Coolest dive bar I've been to since San Diego. Owner is one of the female bartenders. Staff was friendly and all the patrons were from a different walk of life and everyone was welcoming like they were all family and everyone belonged there.  They have this thing with Pabst Blue Ribbon bottles where if you guess the correct suit under the cap you get that bottle free! They have karaoke and pool tables!
0,"Had dinner here while staying at the JW Marriott. Service was very friendly, but a bit slow. Food was decent, but portions were small. Decor is very nice, but I think there must be better options in the Phoenix metro area or even near the hotel. Don't think I would have dinner here again."
1,"This is a great spot for pub food and good beers! \nLive music is often accompanying the night and the ambience is really cool. \nLots of locals, not too many students..\nIt is a bit small but this is helping to create a warm atmosphere too!\nI like Failte in uptown Waterloo!"
1,"I love this place! A few people have mentioned they saw this place on Man vs Food, that's what happened to us too. Saw it, then decided to check it out while we were in town. A no-frill place outside & inside, plastic sheets on the table with a roll of paper towel. They serve mainly seafood (shrimp, crawfish, crab legs, fried fish, etc). Your seafood comes with your choice of seasoning, which also comes with your choice of spiciness levels. I picked the Hot & Juicy Special seasoning in mild, which it still had a bit of a bite to it, with a robust garlic flavor. I loved it.\n\nYour seafood is delivered to your table in a plastic bag, and if you order any potato or corn on the side, they come in the same bag too, along with the seafood & seasonings. My husband ordered the fried catfish basket and he said they were good. No utensils, just you, your plastic bibs and your hands. So it does get quite messy. I ordered  pound each of crawfish, shrimp & crab legs. Just get down to cracking with my food & a few bottles of beer made for a nice, relaxed lunch while on vacation. \n\nThe staff were nice & friendly. Since we were first-timers the girl who seated us explained the different seasonings & spice levels. She was very responsive, replenishing our drinks & clearing up items as we finish. \n\nNot cheap, but seafood usually isn't. I thought the market prices were fair. This will definitely become my Vegas spot to re-visit next time I come in town."
1,"I have used Lauren several over the past couple of years.  She is a true professional and a genuine pleasure to work with.  She listens to what you want and does a beautiful job to accommodate your needs.  I highly recommend her, as she is a personal favorite MUA of mine!"
0,"Can't complain about the food it was quite good. But alas they have one of the big \""no guns\"" signs by the front entrance. This establishment has to go on my don't give them my business lists. \n\nThe sad part is the food is really great. But I have my principals and if they called the police on one of my buddies for carrying a firearm my friend would actually go to jail. \n\nSo be warned."
0,"So, I've read the other reviews on the Restaurant.  I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that didn't \""love it\"".\n\nIf you don't have reservations and show up promptly...they turn you away.  I watched it happen twice.   I'm in another area of service Industry...and I don't believe in turning anyone away for any reason.\n\nFirst Impression....decor was nice...not too over the top...but still had that Epicenter feel.\n\nGreat menu with lots of variety.   I ordered shrimp...it came out COLD.  So I sent it back...and then guy who brought it back to me said \""Now hurry and eat it before it gets cold again\"".... I was appalled.    It's not my fault that my food was sitting in the window too long before it hit the table.   \nAfter the \""re-cook\""  it was fine....I enjoyed my meal.\n\nService was lacking....between the bouncer guy at the door of a restaurant and the slacker that was waiting on us...I'm surprised that we made it to our next venue in time.  Our waiter maybe came over 2 times the entire time.... I just thought he was on a perpetual smoke break someplace.  Waitstaff can definitely be a little more attentive.\n\nI probably will not go back due to the price:service/quality ratio.  It wasn't awful...but it was FAR FROM STELLAR."
0,"Let me begin by saying that the bartender was fabulous - attentive, kind, fashionable, and a real heart for customer service. \n\nFor what we paid, I want the total package...\n\nThe ambiance here really blows. It's like you've stepped into one of those faux French \""paintings\"" you buy at Marshall's that's anything but tres chic. Boxes of crap laying around, things tucked behind curtains or just sitting out. \n\nI never met a flight I didn't love - who doesn't love a change of scenery after deplaning, or the variety that comes with sampling many wines. Flights will run you $18ish.  Isn't that a lot?  We did a sparkling and then a red option. My $5 glass of red during happy hour was just fine. \n\nThe food is sort of an afterthought here. It definitely wouldn't bring me back.  We had the savory cheesecake which continues to sit in my stomach the morning after, and a chopped salad which was overdressed and what I consider a lunch-sized portion. \n\nWith so few days in Scottsdale, I wish we would have skipped this and gone elsewhere. I guess that regret means 2*s."
1,"Terri, owner of Paradox Makeup Artistry & Aesthetics, is an amazing artist. Every look is flawless, she really takes into account the client's facial shape and individual details to plan out the perfect makeover and then takes her time to be sure everything is on-point. Terri really listens to her client's desires and her bombshell makeovers are beyond astounding. She worked with me at an event this past weekend and not only did I get to see her amazing artistry on dozens of clients but I myself got a bombshell makeover. She is a whiz at eyebrows and contouring! I got more compliments that day than I ever have. She's a professional through and through and a sweetheart too. I would not hesitate to hire her in the future and I highly recommend her."
0,"I will admit that I didn't read the fine print on the Groupon and tried to use it on a Saturday afternoon, but the experience was bad from start to finish.  You know that parking will be difficult in that area, so once you've managed to arrive, you're expecting to treated well. \n\n It was pouring rain outside so we inquired about perhaps a hot buttered rum to warm up.  The bartender informed us they didn't have anything like that.  We asked about brandy, and he said they had brandy and asked what kind we wanted.  We asked what they had.  He said he didn't know and went to look.  He returned to tell us that they didn't have any.  Mind you, this is the BARTENDER, and he never even suggested a coffee with khaluha or ANYTHING.  We setteled on jack and coke and looked at the meager menu.  \n\nThey say they are a bar and grill, but your choices consist of two sausages, a couple burgers, a single turkey sandwich, and i think two salads.  It was a joke.  When we were denied the use of the Groupon, we paid our bill and left.  \n\nAs we were leaving there were people at the door that appeared to be the owners.  We walked out shaking our heads at the experience.  Y'all can keep your $10 I wasted on the Groupon.  We already wasted $2 for parking to get to an establishment that is more a bar that serves something to eat than a bar and grill, where the bartenders have no idea what is in stock, nor do they know how to suggest a proper alternative.  REALLY people?  You will be closed in no time....."

1,The atmosphere is what makes this place so amazing. It is fairly dark on the inside and elegant looking. It's like stepping into the past to eat Italian food. The service is wonderful and all of the servers I've gotten weren't afraid to talk to you. \n\nThe food is great and the portions are decent. I usually have left over when I eat there. You also get free garlic bread squares while waiting for your entree to arrive. Be careful not to fill up on those! They are delicious! It's fairly pricey but a very good place to take a date that you that to impress or want to celebrate an anniversary with. I love going there.
0,"Terrible food and service. I wish I had read the reviews first, but we were in a hurry. We stopped in because we liked the outdoor seating. In retrospect, I guess the waiter didn't like us because we didn't order the giant fancy drinks. My husband and I both remarked that it was the worst service we had ever experienced. Aside from the bad waiter, the food was overpriced and disappointing. There were no kid menu items, and the milks for them were $3.50 each and must have been 24 oz. My bad. I should have planned better and picked a more accommodating place for us."
0,"We went here to have a small dinner with family (6 of us).  The waiter recommended that we get the Red Snapper - it was their special or something.  He said the Red Snapper only feeds 3 people so we should get two orders of it.  We told him that we only wanted one order and if we were still hungry we'd order another one.  Food was okay not the greatest.  \n\nWe got our bill and the f***ing piece of fish was $200.  We felt like we got conned.  There was nothing on the menu that was even close to costing $200 so how were we supposed to know it cost that much.  We should have complained to the manager but we didn't want to cause a scene in front of a lot of people.\n\nI've had better fish at the floating market in Bangkok that only cost me $100 Thai Baht ($3 USD).  What if we listened to our con man waiter and went with two pieces of fish?  He would have charged us $400?  I'm never going to this place again.  I recommend to anyone who goes here to order only off the menu because they will screw you if you get the \""special\"".  And yes I went back to check their menu and its not on there.\n\nLast thing.  It took us 20 minutes to get our bill.  Maybe they were debating in the back whether or not we would be stupid enough to pay $200 for a piece of fish.\n\nP.S. I don't understand how everyone on this page is giving them 5 stars.  They must all work there or something."
0,"Very disappointed with this franchise lately. Not only are the stores looking emptier by the day, they went from values and coupons to not even honoring the rewards cards any more. Even airlines give you a nice grace period to collect rewards, but apparently Tropical Smoothie gave customers 1 month to come in and redeem their awards. Needless to say, I didn't know the program had ended and when I joyful entered the store thinking I would get the free smoothie I supposedly earned, I was denied. It seems like the place is becoming less and less customer friendly each time I visit it, not to mention all the employees and managers are kids and there is never anyone with management experience in the stores at any given time.\n\nCustomer service is very important to me so I will most likely stop going to this company."
1,"I have dined here on several occasions for lunch and dinner and I have walked away happy every time. This isn't the place to go if your looking for creative or innovative fine dining. The best words I could use to describe the food is upscale bar food. Flat breads, Burgers, Salads, Rotisserie Chickens they have it all. Everything is reasonably priced and you can get in and out pretty quickly without spending a fortune."
1,"We recently purchased a new home, and consequently, needed a lot of lamps.  We'd driven by this store many times without really paying much attention to it until now.  Upon going in, we realized that their prices are a bit higher.... if you're looking for just a lamp to get by, Home Depot or Target will probably do the job.  But for something that will last and is more of a quality, eye-catching addition to the room, Lamps Plus is the route to go. \n\nEvery time we've been in, the salespeople have been helpful and friendly.  One of the many (10+) lamps we bought was defective and couldn't be assembled.  I brought it back the next day (with the receipt) and had no problems exchanging it.  No problems to speak of on our end."
1,"The owner Peter is amazing. I go there currently for pedicures, done by anyone, they are all just as good there, Peter always does my nails (natural, shaping, color and sometimes gel) he spends EXTRA time making sure my nails are perfect because they are real, I do notice that detail he pays to his work. I also go every other month for a massage, I used one of the lady's that was working there once and it was not worth it at all, but again Peter has magic hands, always helping get the kinks out.\n\nMy complaint would be there are no good hair dressers there so I am still looking and would have loved this to be an all in one like it's suppose to be, also Miriam is no longer there, who was the only person I trusted with my eyebrows and then later my leg waxing, she has moved to a new location and I have followed her. Very inexpensive, well done pedis and manis and massages. \n\nEasy parking, never waited longer than 10 mins, if you make an appointment (you can typically get same day) you are seen right away. They got it together, half way. Get some better hair stylist and skin/wax/ staff and it's brilliant."
1,"Alot of people hate dealing with car dealerships, auto repair shops, etc because most of the time they feel like they are being ripped off, talked to like they are idiots, or the interaction with the people are just more trouble than its worth. I am a shade tree mechanic and absolutely hate letting anybody else touch my car as i do 90% of my own work and trust very few. Tires happen to be one of those things you cant do yourself because of the machines involved and for that i usually go to Discount Tire. After a very negative experience at the West Flamingo location where i honestly was told i don't know what i am talking about i wrote a letter to the Discount Tire office and was contacted by a district manager who sent me to the location off Blue Diamond across from Silverton. This is where i met BILL the manager of this store and his crew, who when i arrived promptly cared for my car and listened to me about the difficulties with my particular set of wheels (rather than not listening and telling me im wrong like the other store). I wan mounting a tricky set of high end forged wheels that required some extra parts and sensors for the car they were being mounted to which is why it took 3 separate times for me to go back and forth the the store to finally get the job completed. During the different times i returns there were bottlenecks that needed to be addressed but at no time did i feel like the store and its crew ever did not have a hold of the work that was being performed, it was just a matter of my parts being difficult. In the end all work was performed and completed and their patience with my job was appreciated as i know its not the typical mount and balance on a Ford Focus. I have now found my go to people for tire labor and will recommend them highly for the customer service and patience.... walk in and ask for BILL."
0,Did not like the pizza puffs or the garlic bread. Too much cheese in the puffs and the bread was bland.  Prices are average as well as the service. Not worth a try... foodwise
1,"What a great addition to downtown Phoenix!! Now, I have yet to see a show here but if it is anything like their bar then it is sure to be fantastic.  \n\nExposed brick, an old piano, large windows, metal tables and dim lighting provide for an enjoyable bar experience.  There are large doors that separate the venue side from the bar area.\n\nTheir strawberry cocktail (Rest Stop)  is one of my favorites drinks ever - its the right amount of flavor and alcohol without the over abundance of sugar, like most strawberry cocktails have. \n\nThe Mexican food here can hold its own and is way more than just \""bar food!\"""
0,More expensive than Petsmart or Walmart. They do have a few things that the two former stores do not carry.\n\nPoor customer service. Employees are weird. Sometimes they talk to each other instead of the customer...while the customer is right in front of them at the cash register. \n\nThey now have an attached grooming service. I don't know. I have just about given up on this place. Would be surprised if they are still around in 6 months.
1,"Shaina was very friendly! Everything was clean and hygienic. She did a great job! When I was looking for a good place to go to, hygiene was #1 on my list. Wipes were provided to freshen up, she wore gloves, fresh paper was laid on the waxing bed, there was no double dipping, gentle and effective wax, fabric sheets to remove the wax were used instead of pressed or paper ones, and she used focused light throughout to make sure she found all the hairs. She then went in with tweezers to remove the few hairs that were left. It was a wonderful experience. I got there late and I was still taken in. It also only took about 15 minutes. Shaina made it as painless as possible and also had me do breathing techniques for the more sensitive areas. It was a breeze! Also, on the website they also let you know not to worry about trimming which was nice so I didn't have to worry about preparing beforehand."
0,The poorest excuse for an ITALIAN restaurante.   The worst service and most disgusting food.  F*ck this place.  I had 14 guests there for my birthday and spent $800 on crap.  These sons of bitches mixed water in our Patron Tequila shots.  5 guests ordered lamb chops and all were burnt to a crisp and RAW on the inside.  Pasta was chewy like gum and stuck to our teeth.   Marsala sauce looked like BBQ sauce.  Absolutely pathetic!!!!!!!  Half of my guests didnt even eat anything off their plates and the retarded waitors nor the manager would even care why the plates were coming back untouched.   long story short this place sucks and some of my guests n myself grabbed a burger and in & out.   Good thing is I work directly across the street from there and work with many clients and I make sure I tell everyone how gross their food and  service is.This was only half the story as I get too frustrated to type anymore.\n (great place to impress a chick that night but thats it!!!)\nPS.....................please please please support your local mom and pop restaurants.
0,"TBC has become a bit of a Scottsdale landmark over the past few years...I use it as a navigation landmark when I have people meeting me in town.\n\n\""Go north on Scottsdale Road and if you see 75 hung over people dressed in Affliction tee shirts and sequined mini-dresses, standing on a street corner waiting for a mediocre breakfast, you've gone too far...in so very many ways\"".\n\nI live (for another few weeks, at any rate) pretty close to TBC and yet, I don't really \""go to there\"" very often (or at all) if I can avoid it.\n\nI just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.\n\nIn addition, the food and service have left me cold (much like my last omelet at TBC a few weeks ago) on my infrequent visits.\n\nBut the amusement factor provided by TBC is (for me at least) quite high, and for that, I'm grateful!\n\nI've been twice in the past year...once for lunch, out of renewed curiosity (I was headed to another spot for lunch and saw a couple reading a menu outside another restaurant and discussing their lunch preferences in loud Scottish accents \""I dinna want a fookin TACO, Angela...I wanna go to the fookin Breakfast Club!\"").\n\nThat was almost a year ago...and I went once for breakfast, recently, because the Beautiful Carin likes TBC.\n\nAnd what Carin wants, Carin gets!\n\nBut both visits featured mediocre food (esp. for the price) and mediocre service (at any price).\n\nMy last visit also featured an apparently broken exhaust duct that runs under the booths at the north end of the place.\n\nHot, humid cooking exhaust, coming up through the seams in the upholstery, steamy cooking aroma's wafting around me from below...I was about to call Guinness because I thought I was setting a new world record for sustaining a fart!\n\nBut the aromatic breeze didn't stop! \n\nAnd even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!\n\nOur server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old \""model\"" (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!\n\nMaybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.\n\nAt any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?\n\nIt wouldn't be fair!\n\nTBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that."
0,"I've been going to Cafe Rio for over 15 years. Since moving to Arizona from Cali we were pretty excited to be close to the  one on Baseline which is about 15-20 min from where we live but that made no difference because we loved Cafe Rio in the past. That location was average, always out of ice and always trying to rush you through the line. The food pretty good which kept us going back.\nWhen the San Tan location opened we were pretty excited because of its proximity. In the last year we've probably been 10-15 times to Baseline and this location 4 times. The other night we went and they were super chinsy on the meat we ordered 5 meals and each meal hardly had meat. Feels like Cafe Rio has gone down hill since franchising which is to be expected, but the prices continue to get higher. Get your act together Cafe Rio."
0,My wife got a bannana mocha and she really didnt like it but she did finish it over the 5 hour drive home.
1,"i don't use profanity in my reviews, but i cannot find any other words that can express the hot wings.  they are so fucking delicious it's ridiculous.  the chicken wing is cooked well, where it gets crispy and is juicy in the middle.  there is little fat, you you are actually eating a chicken wing.  i pretty much ate everything off the bone.  they have many different kinds of sauce you can select, mild to suicide, honey, bbq, and those sweet flavors with heat for any taste you're in the mood for.  the hot sauce (the step down from suicide) with the wing itself, created the most delicious hot wing i ever had.  it had heat and flavor, without too much of a vinegar taste.  i seriously wanted to lick the plate.  on wednesday their special is 10 wings for $3.00.\n\nthe only reason why i did not give this place 5 stars was because of the bartender.  the drinks were weak.  they use canned juice and red bull instead of the bulk or spout kind, which i appreciate the taste.  i went up to the bar and said i wanted to do a shot.  i am spoiled and don't know the names of any shots (my regular bartenders knows what me and my friends like and will just randomly make stuff that he knows we'll like).  i tell the bartender vodka is ok, no tequila, something that tastes kind of like fruit punch.  she rolls her eyes with her hands on her hips and mentions they don't have any fruit punch.  i mention that the only thing i can remember the name of is the around the world, and she told me you can't make that into a shot.  hahahaha, that's pretty much all i know it as, she was ridiculous.  she made this grape and pineapple juice crap that hardly tasted like booze (i saw her pour, it was pretty much just juice).  aside from her, the server, who was nice, got mine and my friends drink mixed up.  she had a red straw in the one she thought was the raspberry, but the mandarin was made in that glass, so we switched.  when i ran out of my drink, i asked for another mandarin red bull and she brought me a raspberry since the red straw was in it. \n\nthey do karaoke on wednesday and another night i cannot remember.  the selection of songs is great.  there were newer songs.  they had amy winehouse, hot hot heat, panic at the disco, fall out boy, the entire rent soundtrack (which my friend was excited about).  the ones i was amazed to see were teddy geiger, ryan adams, and jeff buckley.  and if that wasn't all... fuck her gently by tenacious d.  my friends and i have wanted to sing this song at our bar forever, they wouldn't even let us sing it a capella.  it was so rad to sing it, it was like some great accomplishment."

0,"In November of 2012 I had a pea sized spot on my underarm that didn't look right, so my PCP referred me to Woodson Dermotology.  \n\nI saw the PA, John.  I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.  I was surprised, as I had ringworm a number of years ago.  But I trusted him and took the pills and cream I was prescribed.  I had a follow-up appoint the next month, and explained to him that it's only getting bigger (MUCH bigger) and didn't look or feel like ringworm.  It was not itchy, did not spread, not scaly, and didn't seem to be contagious.  He reassured me that it \""just presents differently in the armpit\"" I was frustrated but took the new pills and creams I was given.  Again, nothing happened except it was getting BIGGER.  I again had a follow up the next month and expressed my concerns AGAIN.  Nothing, just more creams and pills. This went on and on every month until JULY!!!  For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.  Upon googling it, I read that even UNTREATED ringworm lasts a maximum of 4 months.  \n\nI would much rather hear \""I'm not really sure what this is! Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion\""  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.  But he is too proud to do that.  \n\n In July I went in and there was a PA fresh out of school that John was training.  This PA took ONE look at my \""ringworm\"" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, \""I think you have given me this before\"" he said \""hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before\""  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, \""just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!\""  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. \n\n At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said \""what is that?\""  she said \""polysporin\""  I quickly yell \""I'm allergic to that!\"" before she can get any on me.  Why do you even ask what I am allergic to?  Seriously!  I was supposed to come back 2 weeks later to get the results and get my stitches out. \n\n So 2 weeks later I come back to get my Biopsy results and stitches removed. She took out my stitches and started to leave.  I said \""Excuse me, do you have my biopsy results?\"" she said \""No\"" and started to walk again.  I said \""Are you sure, it's been 2 weeks\"" She sighed and actually opened my file this time (imagine that!) and said \""oh yeah, here it is, it's benign\""  I said \""ok, but is it the granuloma annulare?\"" she said \""yes, that was positive\""  I said \""ok, can you tell me what that is or anything about it?\""  She said she wasn't familiar with it.  OK...... \""can I talk to John or anyone else that does know?\""  She said \""no, they're all busy, but you can make another appointment in a few weeks to talk to him if you have questions\"" I was done, didn't give an answer just stormed out, said goodbye and thank you to the only person worth a crap there (the front office) and went home. \n\n Why would you have someone give you biopsy results and not tell you anything about it?!?  I have wasted almost a YEAR of my life and missing work to go to these appointments every month, because John was too proud to admit he was wrong.  I would love to thank the new guy that diagnosed me at first sight, but never saw him again.  Please don't waste your time here!  If you get a super early appointment there is no wait, John is VERY nice, however none of that matters if you can't get treated for what it actually wrong."
0,I was so excited that Crab Corner opened on Rainbow and Sunset. I took my friend there for a belated birthday lunch as she is from Maryland and loves good crab. \n\nWe got seated at a table in the middle of the room - no biggie - except that the waiter mentioned that it is much warmer in this area. The restaurant was absolutely freezing! I had a sweater on but my friend had a light sweater and was miserable cold the whole time we were there. \n\nThe waiter was attentive except he had his cell phone out and was checking it in between talking to us which was very annoying. He was very informative and went into detail about the menu along with the specials. Both waiters were running non-stop but did check in with tables. We did not get a refill of our drinks which was disappointing.\n\nWe were served soup in Styrofoam bowls - REALLY! The soup was very good but we had to eat it quickly as it cooled off fast. The crab cakes we ordered were excellent with 1/3 pound of crab and was served on fun red plates. The homemade coleslaw was very good and definitely a great side. \n\nI would like to try the blue crab and other entrees but not until the place warms up!
1,The reverse happy hour is amazing! I love the food there and the drinks are also fantastic! Can't wait to go back for more drinks!
1,"8.01.08: It's my best friend's birthday so we wanted to enjoy luxury! After shopping and eating at a freaking food court it was time to head to the beautiful Venetian. I guess we came just in time, we only waited about 3 minutes to check in.\n\nMarcela is her name! She helped us out alot. \n\nMe: Can we can get a room with a pull-out sofa bed?\nMarcela: Sure.\nMy Girl: Thanks.\nMe: O the only reason why we need a sofa bed is because she's a pig. *points to my girl*\nMarcela: Giggles\nMe: Seriously she's small and only 4 feet 11, but man she can kick you off the bed.\nEveryone: Giggles\nMarcela: Yea she is a small girl..Let me see if there is one available.\nMy Girl: I need my space. \nMy Girl: Can we get a room that is high? Like up up up there?\nMe: yea please?\nMarcela: Ok, *type type type* We have one room available but its an extra $50 each night. \nMe and my girl: *sigh*\nMe: NM thanks for checking I don't wanna go broke just to have a nicer view. \nMarcela: Yea true stick with what you have. You're probably gonna be out partying most of the night.\nMe and my girl: *nodds*\n\nMarcela knows vegas..anyone that comes to vegas stays in their room maximum 2 hours. ha ha.\n\nI had a tummy ache on the way to our room elevator. Man lets just say thank goodness for that restroom. It was clean, beautiful, and located perfectly when I needed it.\n\nUp to the 5th floor we go! We didn't have a nice view but the room was beautiful. We were going to take a picture but we already messed up the room in 2 mins. our suit cases everywhere, we pull out the sofa bed and etc. \n\nFour stars still? Why? Although everything about it was lovely and Marcela was great, there is one big big downer! The room has not been fully cleaned. We didn't have enough towels, the robe from the closet was missing, our iron didn't fully work and it damaged my dress, there was used q-tips in the restroom, there was not a plastic bag that should have came with our ice bucket, and what else....???... Yea that should be it..\n\nThe pool was nice but very very crowded. But I gotta say one thing, this is the place to be! Everyone and almost everyone is pretty good looking. All the girls and guys. Man its freaking amazing. Its like a swimsuit fashion up in here! OOoOoo LA LA!\n\nWish to stay here again if we can find cheaper rates! O and this place is most worth it since its a suite compared to other hotels with the same rate. LOVE IT!\n\nDid you say vegas? Take me!"
0,"I have to give this place a one star review. My first ever :( Mostly because I was unable to experience it. My Husband and I attempted to have lunch here Saturday afternoon but the service was awful. When we got there we were one of 5 total tables. We were sat down and then no one ever returned. Maybe there was a miss communication on who's table we were at but it was frustrating to sit there and see at least a half dozen employees doing busy work and still have no service. Sad part was we had our whole meal planned right down to our after desert drinks. My husband works for an all Italian company and is one of the few Americans on staff, they all follow the associazione verance pizza napoletana and he was thrilled to test out a new place to tell the guys about. Unfortunately we just walked out since i was unable to flag someone down after 30 minutes. Maybe we will try it out again and I can change this review but  I have a feeling it wont be for awhile."
1,"love this store,  im currently expecting and already purchased my babies bassinet,  crib with mattress and changing station for $250.  Maternity clothes is also very cute and affordable"
1,"Excellent burger. Whole set up was a little intense though ... Recommend doing as take out for a more relaxed way to enjoy an amazing burger. \nI felt like I inhaled a giant burger because I was sitting at the counter almost on top of the grill and was rushed to keep moving. There are only a few counter seats (6-7?) and a few high-top tables. \nAlso - potato salad was ok, but reco sticking with the fries. \n\nEveryone was nice and fun...just limited space to have an intimate experience their burgers deserve."
1,U gotta stop here...
1,"We usually always go on weekends for lunch right when they open, thus we have no trouble being sat in a spacious, comfy, quiet booth.  The service is prompt, polite and never too \""in your face\"" . The smoked wings or the jalape\u00f1os are a home run for an appetizer. Then again, everything on the menu is pretty much a home run depending on your taste. The food and drinks are consistently good. The atmosphere is welcoming, not overkill for a BBQ restaurant. All around an A+"
0,"Rude, racist, dark. Unconscious drunk people at the bar or at the entrance smelling like urine. Homeless old men grabbing at my date. Pretty much an assault. Place attracts the detritus."
1,"If you're looking for a buffet on the Strip that offers a difference experience (in both food and presentation) from ordinary buffets, definitely try the buffet at Paris.\n\nThis buffet is a great reminder of what can be great about Vegas; dining in Le Village will immerse you into the feel and charm of eating in a nice village in France. From the setting to the waiters, and of course the food, the ambiance certainly sets Le Village apart from other contemporary buffets.\n\nBut the food. That's what we came here for right? And believe me, it won't disappoint. Beyond offering some of the more traditional stuff you'll see at every buffet, Le Village has French-influenced food (surprise surprise) which was a big hit for me. I definitely loved the selection and was able to try different things. And perhaps the best part of it all is that there's a crepe station to fulfill all your sweet-tooth desire. But be forewarned, the crepe line can get mighty long, so if there's an opening, it might be smart to grab one real fast. \n\nOverall, I've been here on a couple occasions and I had a stellar experience each time. Definitely recommending Le Village if you're looking for a buffet that's not at the Wynn or Caesar's."
0,"Acrid New York steak. I sent it back, they had to redo - they recooked in the back, not on teppan grill.\n\nShrimp was miscounted for table - teppan chef had to step in and manage to get more for table while multitasking.\n\nWas great when it opened, place has taken a serious nose dive.\n\nGo to Rock Lobster by CHoP, corner of Price and Queen Creek in the Cays. Much better."
1,"Harlow's gives me diarrhea.  Every time.  Every single time.  You know what, though?  I don't care because Harlow's cuts my hangover directly in half and I feel twice as good when I leave.  If I get me some diarrhea, that's okay.  It's a price I'm willing to pay.\n\nTheir food is diner food.  I mean, what you get is going to be a little on the greasy side and you'll taste it in your burps for a few hours.  Some of their food might cause some slight indigestion.  I, however, kind of enjoy heavy ass diner food that settles right to the bottom of my gut. \n\nWhen you order a water and a coffee, they'll be filled constantly.  I mean constantly.  At most places, you drink maybe altogether two cups of coffee throughout the course of your meal.  At Harlow's, if you really wanted to, you could burn through like ten cups of joe.\n\nI've been to this place with some gnarly hangovers I can't even begin to explain.  One time I went here so hung over that it felt like I coming down off of a crazy psilocybin trip.  Harlow's makes me feel better.  A LOT better.  The ambience is a little douche-y and kind of conservative-Republican and they make the waitresses wear those embarrassingly small shorts and I get diarrhea whenever I go here.... fuck it.  I still like it."
0,"Our waiter greeted us by saying \""Brand is one of the ten best steak houses on the strip.\""\n\nI'm sad to say I strongly disagree.\n\nMy husband and I came here for a rare night out while my parents watched our 2 year old daughter in our hotel room. \nWe arrived around 8:30 pm, on a weeknight.  The restaurant was not busy at all, but they seated us at a tiny table even though there were plenty of open tables that would have been more comfortable.\nOur server took a long while to even bring us a menu or offer drinks.  We got the drinks and our appetizers ordered without any issues. \nThe buffalo wings were the highlight of our meal.  It's the one thing I can say we enjoyed.  \n I watched a server bring out our main course, see that we were still eating our salad and then go to the back of the restaurant and set our food down on a random empty table.  \nA couple minutes later another server came and took away the salad I was eating before I was done.  Annoying.\nShe then brought our main course out again but this time put it on our table.\nMy steak that was supposed to be cooked medium rare - medium was very well done.\nI have to wait a good 5 minutes to get the waiters attention. I tell him I'm disappointed in my steak.  He offers to have it re-made, and I say ok.  \nSadly, my husbands food was not re-made.  So we did not eat together.  In fact, I did not get to eat at all.  By the time my steak was done, so was my husband. He had eaten.  His dishes had been cleared.  \nAt this point a very polite manager came to our table and offered me my steak.  I had to decline however.  I was in no mood to eat alone.  I was irritated.  All excitement for the meal was lost.\nTo their credit our meal was compt.  They were very apologetic.  \n\nBut they are far from the best steak house on the strip."
0,"It was my first time to Gertrude's and I was very excited to try the food and experience the botanical garden. When I arrived, we were told they could seat us right away but we had to give up our table in an hour. I've never been to any restaurant where I have been told I had to give up my table. After they sat us, it took them over 10 minutes to offer us drinks and they were not that busy at this point. I am in my 20's and it is clear we were given a different level of service. The food was great but I was so turned off by the service that I don't plan on returning."
1,The food is wonderful!  The portions are good and there is great variety.  Service has always been good.
0,It is a great spot for lunch if you want to spend a little more. This place is a bit lame in the evenings though.
0,"A waste of time and money.  Ordered the Porterhouse medium rare, it arrived cold and super rare.  Waiter chatting incessantly through out the meal, hard to enjoy the company we were with.  A poor reflection on the owner of this restaurant, as I am sure most people go there because of the owner. Had a nine pm reservation and still had to wait more than 30 minutes for our table in a restaurant that clearly wasn't full.  Save your time and your money."
1,"I like BLT burger better, but this is very good. Really good burgers made with what you want how you want, all served up fresh and yummy."
0,"Being from Tucson, I used yelp to try and locate what is supposedly the best mexican food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I had high hopes when I arrived at this restaurant.  It is charming, and looks authentic.  Much like the restaurants down in Tucson.  The chips and salsa came out quick, and the service was great.  Chips and salsa were very good.  However, I was disappointed that you only get one serving, and then you have to pay $3 for another....something that I have never seen before.\n\nBut sadly, this is was the only positive for the restaurant.  I had a #1 and the person I was eating with had flat enchiladas.  If this is the best Phoenix has to offer, I feel bad for anyone living here.  The food lacked flavor, the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top.  Beans and rice were not good at all.\n\nThe sopapillas were good, but that is not hard to mess up.\n\nAlso way overpriced for what you get. \n\n\nDo yourself a favor, and find another restaurant.  Not worth your time."
0,"So after gambling $120 at the bar with full bets I was told that I didn't gamble enough to have my three beers and shot of whisky comped. Then the bartender comped the guys drinks next me who only gambled $20 and ordered $50 in drinks. This place sucks, especially the staff. Never going there again."
1,"The biggest Lee's I ever been to! They have fro-yo machines too. Unfortunately, those weren't up and running yet!\n\nLine was super long, but I have to give them props to maintaining such a busy crowd in an orderly manner.  \n\nThe sandwiches were consistent with other Lee's that I've been to.  They even had a window with all their fresh baked bread! Check out picture uploaded :)\n\nTheir coffee is awesome! Strong, flavorful.  It was what I needed to wake myself up from late nights and long hours of driving!\n\nI only wish they had more to-go stuff that other Lee's have available (ie. sticky rice, spring rolls, vietnamese desserts, etc).  This place is more focused on sandwiches.  Think of a Mcdonald's version of Lee's!"
0,"Around 8 PM my roommates and I are hungry, not wanting to cook, so we decide on pizza. This Pizza Hut is a stone's throw from our house and we have a coupon, sounds simple enough.\n\nWRONG.\n\nAfter ordering online, I pull up to Pizza Hut around 8:30 and walk up to the door.It's locked. Confused, I try the other door. Locked. There's a boy inside sweeping. He looks at me, I gesture to the door, and he then continues to sweep. Huh?\nI walk back to my car and look up the phone number on my GPS, there is no answer, so I drive home. I get to the house and tell my roommates what happened, so we pull up the online order and see if we were able to order due to a glitch, since they were obviously closed. 9 PM closing time. It's now about 8:45 or so, and my phone rings as we are still looking at the computer. \n\""Hey this is... from Pizza Hut.. are you going to pick up your pizza?\""\nUm...\nI tried..\n\""Okay.. so how long will it take you to get here?\""\nUm...\n5 minutes I guess...\n\nI drive back and walk up to the door. The door is still locked, that kid in the corner is still sweeping. I knock loudly on the door and three people appear from the back kitchen area. \n\n\""Sorry about the mix up, we upgraded your order for you.\""\nOpen the box- instead of the Supreme Pizza Mia we ordered is a very old looking pepperoni stuffed-crust pizza.\nHuh?\n\""So the total is $16.25.\""\nWhat? Is this happening?\n\n.. Um I'm not paying for this...\nEveryone looks at everyone awkwardly, but the kid in the corner keeps sweeping.\n\""Oh.. Okay..hold on.\""\nThe man in a tie, who I assume is the manager goes into the back and grabs one of their new pasta dishes, and puts it on top of the unwanted pizza.\n\""Tell you what- Dinner is on me today, miss, have a great night.\""\nUm.. okay.. Thanks...\nNever got an explanation for the bizarre first trip and more importantly never even got the pizza we ordered.\n\nDrove back home."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE.  Unless you don't care what your clothes look like, save yourself. \n\nI live around the corner, so this place is super convenient.  I should have stopped going here after the first problem, but I always like to give a business a few shots.\n\nThe first problem happened with my fianc\u00e9's business shirts.  He dropped several off before 9 am in order to get his items back by 4 pm, same day service is what Seville prides themselves on.  He went in to pick up his items that evening, and they were not ready.  They said that they laundered her shirts first, and THEN were going to dry clean them.  He was not told of this procedure, and he was out of his shirt for a meeting the next day.\n\nI dropped of a few sweaters and a jacket yesterday, only to pick up my items and realize there was a huge stain on one of my sweaters that I planned to wear to an event TONIGHT.  There were absolutely no stains on my sweater prior to dropping it off.  In fact, the sweater was brand new, only worn once, but had delicate beading on it that needed some TLC versus the washer.  I decided to call Seville to see what they can do, I was not hostile or rude, yet the owner, John, proceeded to school me on how it is 'chemically impossible for dry cleaning to stain any clothing garment' along with his additional analogy of 'you know, you can pour Sprite or something on your shirt, and those chemicals have a reaction with the dry cleaning that is unforeseeable' -- or what I call POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I was simply calling to see what he could do, perhaps re-do the dry cleaning, not to bitch him out.  He finally said they would attempt to look at it, and to bring it back in and let the ladies at the desk know I spoke to him.  Well, because I live around the corner, I just drove up there and spoke with one of the ladies.  She mentioned that John was there and she would go talk to him.  NEVER SAW HIM.  Never got an apology from him, nothing.  The lady was nice enough to say she was sorry that it happened.  \n\nSO ANNOYED.  This place SUCKS.  Go to Prestige Cleaners a little further up on Goldwater and save yourself from John's poor customer service."
0,"Not really sure where to begin with this company. First let me start off be telling you any purchase you make there is not guaranteed! At least mine wasn't. They still have my umbrella, in like new condition...that I paid for. The umbrella was supposed to be fixed, and the part ordered for its replacement. It was... a call was made to me to let me know it was there anytime I wanted to swing by and pick it up.\n\nLong story short, they \""lost\"" the replacement part, tried selling me on a new umbrella over the phone and still have my existing umbrella!\n\nThanks for your wonderful service \""after the sale\""!"
0,"I am beginning to really dislike this drive thru location.  3rd time they can't seem to get a drink order right. I asked for a kids milk light ice, & we have our cup for her. As well as an iced coffee with splash of milk. Again they gave her chocolate milk/heavy ice. Ugh"
0,"It's sad to be bored by a frozen desert while simultaneously intimidated by the foreshadowed wallet wallop. They got me and my wife for almost $10 last night and we both aggregated the experience with our first trip and concluded that we won't be back. The product is plain-Jane regular city junk and I can't believe they will be around for the long haul. Does anyone really believe they are getting something healthy here? Fruit??!!??? You just put a few pieces of lay-around fruit on top of a ton of sugar calories!! And if you got a small portion, WHY? Oh, and you can get a smoothie!! I love it! How about some styrofoam peanuts on that? I'm back to the frozen aisle at Safeway until I can get over to try Sweet Republic. It better be good!"
1,"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and two other dining companions for dinner.  I had driven by this place many times before and barely noticed it until a couple of Saturdays ago and mentioned it to my friends who had also been wanting to try it.  Upon entering the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was how large the restaurant actually was as it went back much further from the street than I would have imagined.  After waiting around for a minute or two without being noticed I decided to try to find our friends to no avail.  Finally after 5 or so minutes of waiting for the hostess someone appeared and explained that the rest of our party was already seated downstairs and pointed to a set of stairs.  Surprisingly they actually have a second full dining room and bar downstairs.\n\nFor our appetizer our whole table decided to split the fried zucchini appetizer for two.  The portion size was huge and it was easily enough for all four of us to split.  The zucchini had been cut in very thin strips length-wise and was breaded with a nice but light breading and served with a side of marinara and a bunch of different lemons.  What was odd is that we were still left with our menus whenever it came out and seeing how we did not have much room to spare everyone at our table ended up doing something different with their menu.  Personally I put it under my appetizer plate and ate off of it.  Even with that odd arrangement I thought it tasted pretty good, after all who doesn't like fried food, especially when squeezing some of the lemon juice onto the breading.  Finally after we had finished our appetizer the waitress took our entr\u00e9e order for which I decided upon the chicken romano with a side of their polenta.  The chicken came out on a plate by itself as 3 decent sized pieces.  It tasted good with some hints of lemon and cheese and the breading was also nice and light.  The polenta came out looking almost like a piece a cake with the top very dark, almost black, and was surrounded by a bed of marinara sauce.  It was ok although I can't really tell you that I tasted too much other than the marinara sauce that I was dipping it into.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably come here again in the future.  Our service upon entering the restaurant was not that great although it did improve the deeper we got into dinner.  With that being said I loved the large portion sizes and ended up going home with a full stomach."
1,"My first time to visit, and I hit a GREAT sale. 4 pairs of shoes for $75, and all of the shoes are very stylish. One of the employees, Brian, was very helpful! When a shoe was a little loose, he simply added some padding and the shoe fit just right. I am glad I discovered this place, and will definitely go again. Great prices, great customer service."
1,"This is my go-to Indian place.  They have deals on Groupon most weekdays--$15 for $30 worth of food.  That's more than enough during lunch when they have their lunch specials: 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes and 2 desserts.  During dinner, I use that to order my usual: Veggie samosas, Chicken Tikka Makhani, Basmati rice and 1 side or dessert.  Very filling!  The samosas here are well made and not as greasy as other Indian restaurants make them.  \n\nThe manager is a very nice guy!  He remembers us each time we visit.  I had bangs then no bangs between 2 visits and he didn't want to say, \""Welcome back!\"" to my boyfriend because he thought maybe he brought in another girl!!  I found it hilarious.  So the manager has your back, haha.  The wait staff is very prompt w/taking your order, refilling drinks and getting the check to you.\n\nPricey w/o deals from Yelp or Groupon, but still worth it either way."
0,"So we got fooled by Yelp again. The idea of Chinese/Italian fusion never sounded appetizing until I read all of these (possibly fake?) rave reviews. We tried the Pasta China dish and the Szechuan Chicken pasta both off the fusion side of the menu. First, the plates put on the table looked nothing like the pictures here on Yelp. Besides that, the noddles were so overcooked and sticky you could lift everything off the plate in one lift of the fork. It was bad folks, I mean really bad. The Szechuan dish was basically noodles with peanut butter. The Pasta China was a terrible version of chow mein. I guess the only thing this place has going for it is the price. But is cheap food really worth a hour of your life and a lifetime of regret?"
0,"I'm sure I've been eating that this place since before birth.  I was born an raised in Glendale.  \n\nThe hostess that sat us took us to a table that still had plates, and cups from the last customers. We had to point it out to her if she was going to clear the table.  I had the Red Menudo, and my guest had the Carne Asada burrito. The order took 1 hour 20 minutes to get to us.  Burrito was cold to the touch, and other food matter on the plate that I'm thinking was not garnish. I asked that it be redone fresh, which it was. I waited to eat because my guest was w/o her order.  When food was brought back out, I was asked if I wanted mine reheated at which said no. My Red Menudo was orange in color, and the broth/caldo had no taste to it at all. This was a waist of 2 hours of my Sunday.  I have always look the other way when it came to La Perla Caf\u00e9, but I'm so done.  I will find another place to take my family after Mass."
1,We go here all the time and I love the food I have tasted everything on the menu it's one of my favorite places!!!
0,"Shelled out over $100 on the first night of our long awaited trip to Vegas. Thought it was pretty good, until the food poisoning hit the next day.  Had to cut our trip short, and make the long, miserable trip home to Phx. Tried to contact the restaurant, just to let them know, but got the run around, and never was able to talk to anyone associated with the restaurant. They don't care."
0,"Don't eat here if you want good food.  I thought it was expensive for what you get and its too noisy and dark.  Do not ask to sit by the waterfall because you wouldn't be able to hear the person across from you.  Then there was thunder every 10 minutes, it got pretty annoying.  And its dark inside.  What a waste of money."
1,"Las Vegas is certainly not short on selection when it comes to shopping but get yourself out of the malls and casinos (and the malls IN casinos) and come downtown to Coterie if you want a well-edited collection of clothes for men and women that you won't find anywhere else in the 702.\n\nI went with three (two men, one woman) friends and everyone found something. I scouted out two tops and one skirt all deeply discounted on the sale rack in back. I also saw a sage and leather etched mini dress from 12th St by Cynthia Vincent on sale and wished it fit me!\n\nCoterie closed whilst I was still in the dressing room and I didn't detect a whiff of annoyance from anyone working here. They kept the music going and made jokes while ringing up purchases. Some members of my party may have also been loud and rowdy and the staff handled these shenanigans with aplomb.\n\nI'm definitely coming back to Coterie."
1,"For food: 5 stars. For service: 3 stars is generous. My party of three went to Sushi Koma on a busy Friday night. We placed our orders (2 AYCE dinners, and one dinner entr\u00e9e for our non-sushi eater.) We ordered just a few things to get started, and were impressed when not five minutes later the first part of our order rolled out: a couple of rolls, and a gyoza app for our non sushi eater. We tucked in, looking forward to a nice meal. (OMG, tuna carpaccio with roasted shaved garlic! Amazing!) It was a busy night, but the place is small, and there were three chefs working the bar, and four servers, who were very attentive and sweet, BUT... totally disorganized. \n\nAll four of the servers seemed to be working our table, and while one of them would come around every few minutes to ask if we'd like to order something else, we had to keep replying that unfortunately, we were still waiting on items we'd already ordered and didn't want to order more than we could eat. There seemed to be no centralization of orders, and while having four attentive, very friendly servers is awesome, having just one server who made sure that our orders came out correctly and in a timely fashion would have been better. We had to ask for the rest of our order five times, and our non sushi friend waited about 45 minutes for his chicken teriyaki bowl. We were there for over two hours, and while the food was excellent, the efficiency and accuracy of the service was not.\n\nOne of the servers later apologized and explained that our entire second round order was given to another table by mistake. We waited about half an hour with no items delivered. With AYCE, at least you're not going to be charged for something you ordered, but didn't receive, but it's still annoying. We eventually got everything we ordered, but wouldn't have if we hadn't kept track of it ourselves. The food was wonderful, and the service was well intentioned and friendly, so I'm willing to give them another try, but I won't come when I'm in a hurry, or if there's someone I want to impress. I want to spend my meal enjoying my food, and not tracking down orders because one of my dining companion hasn't gotten his entr\u00e9e. \n\nTuna carpaccio, seafood tostada, sashimi roll, and chicken teriyaki apps are a must! The Elephant roll and Stephanie rolls were great!"
1,My favorite Indian restaurant! Food is fantastic! Decant price! If you are gonna do dinner the portions are bigger then most Indian restaurants so great for big parties. I prefer the lunch experience with the nice verity of dishes!
0,"Wow, this may be one of my first 2 star meals.  Probably because I was so pissed how terrible it was.\n\nI get it.  Late at night, with a rowdy crowd, drinks, ladies and guys, who really cares about the food?  So that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one.\n\nThe chips and salsa were ordered (it's not free) and it wasn't bad.  I liked the different salsas and the chips were fresh.  \n\nI had steak tacos.  I'm not looking for the absolute in authenticity.  When I saw the tacos arrive at the table I was a little bummed about flour tortillas for tacos.  But I'm game to have some flour tacos once in a while.\n\nIt was your typical \""gringo\"" taco.  Flour tortilla, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar, and meat.  The meat had a good flavor, but was extremely fatty.  There were pieces of fat that I was spitting out.  \n\nFor the record, I'm not a fat-o-phobe.  Give me pork bellies, pastrami, chinese spare ribs, beef short ribs, etc.  I don't run away and demand leanness.  The meat could have been easily trimmed.  The fat really did not have any place in these tacos.  \n\nWhat bothered me the most (and I'm still thinking about it) was that the taco without the meat tasted a lot like Del Taco/Taco Bell.  I'm not dramatic in my reviews, and I don't pull the \""this place tasted like fast food\"" card unless really deserving.  I would even go as far to say that it was borderline \""grody\"".  And I haven't used that word since I was 7.\n\nAll in all, the ambiance and \""potential\"" gave this place 2 stars.  The prices were outrageous for what I got, even despite this being Vegas.  \n\nWith that being said, management could maybe try a little harder to make the tacos a little more memorable.  Perhaps a more rustic or hand made tortilla (flour is still ok if you must) and perhaps a sprinkle of Cotija cheese.  Trim that fat off the meat and maybe add a nice thin slice of avocado inside the taco.  Maybe a little Guajillo chile or chipotle flavor would add to the flavor profile.  \n\nAnyways, I see this place could be a lot of fun for drinks and having a good time, but I'll pass on the food unless it's for something that you absolutely can't mess up (I think), like a quesadilla.  But anything is possible."
0,"1. Overall, a mediocre mix of food and generic experience. It is truly, by all definitions - a tourist trap. One sign of this is that it is only open after 5 pm daily. Literally, a bus or two will come through every evening as far as I can tell. (I am a 36 year resident of Las Vegas.)\n\n2. First, the food. Olive Garden is at least two levels better in quality. My wife and I believe the sauce is simply canned, nothing more or less. The lasagna, again, normal. Any degree of spice or uniquity is simply altogether missing. Strangely enough, the garlic bread was good and so was the expresso - small victories for a higher, mid-level priced dinner.\n\n3. I think the 'never-ending' free wine basically makes many customers happy in lieu of good food. It's normal.\n\n4. The wait was was long - 30 minutes, because of the tour bus. The bar drink we had while waiting was experience.\n\n5. With all due respect, the accordion player with the disability, was playing off of peoples emotions. He would play a few seconds literally, say the same thing to most of the tables in the room - most of it was geared towards how beautiful the female was, everyone would give him money,and then 30 minutes later, the same routine, and same peddling for money. It's not right. We felt pressured to do as the other tables did and give him a few bucks each time.\n\n6. Of all the Italian places to eat in Las Vegas, I would never suggest this place to eat. Fast-food or sit-down are all superior to this. \n\n7. As I read in another review, it is true that the decor is somewhat interesting with vintage Las Vegas pictures. But does this overcome the shortcomings? No. I am torn between 1 and 2 stars."
0,"First off, service is a little slow here. From what I was seeing they're were only around 2 servers in the whole place and even though I was only taking a to go order I the servers still seemed a little confused on if we gotten our orders taken already which we already did. As I waited for our order I looked around to see some people eating in were looking around for the waitress. From that case, I figured the place was just under staffed. \n\nNow to the food it self, \nThe price ran about $12-14 for our vegetable tofu pho which is a little pricey for Pho but I let that issue pass since everything in Vegas is overpriced anyways. Now the taste is what really threw me off. First off it didn't even smell like pho. The broth smelled more like top ramen broth and the noodles thick and slimy. Lucky I was starving by that point so I just ate it anyways.\n\nOverall, \nWould I come back here? No. Was it worth my money? Not really.\nI probably wouldn't try a pho place around the strip again anyways since the strip itself caters more over to the traditional american, french, and italian food. If you want good  pho you have better luck off the strip and exploring into town a little bit for it rather than the strip."
0,"So these guys were meant to finish putting my tires on in 45 minutes, yeah? Thus my hiatus to Culver's, yeah? Hoping that on my return in 45 minutes, my car would have two brand new 255/95R18's on as they quoted, yeah? It didn't quite happen that way! \n     I strolled back from Culver's ready to drive off....but the numbers on my invoice were not the ones I paid for... they put on some tires that cost 90 bucks each, when I paid for 280 each for two!  Not sure why they did this....were they hoping that I would drive off not realizing since I'm female? ? ?"
1,"I had to organize our company convention,  I picked this show because I thought it would be fun. I had a private show, if you have 70 people or more you can have a private show. I was nervous because I wasn't sure if this would be a bad show. I'm glad I picked this show. I recommend if you have a corporate event you pick them very reasonable in price. It was worth every penny. Not only did they create a script just for us they did research on our company.  They kept the group laughing so hard. Everyone left with a picture that's extra money but even with a picture and getting two drinks per person it was very affordable. (Affordable for a corporate event)"
0,"First off the food was ok. Just ok. One of our diners had the ribeye Oscar style and it was so tough he didn't even finish half of it. What a waste. Looked dry from where I sat. Hubby had Etouffee and he liked it but had better elsewhere.  We all had Caesar salads, very tasty and the only dressing not made in-house. I had the Shrimp Brochette Appetizer with a salad for dinner, the shrimp with bacon could have cooked a little longer so all meats could cook through. Had a stomach problem later that evening. Bread Pudding, good, Beinget too doughy and overly powdered with sugar.  Nothing spicy, though I thought the Etouffee would be.\n\nService, well we had a reservation and the hostess wanted to seat us at the first table as you walked in to the main dining room when most all tables at that time were empty.  We asked for another table and she really didn't want to move us any further than the table next to it because as she said, later reservations were planned for those tables. Why in the world would you seat people at the first table everyone has to walk by when there were available tables the same size further in?  Our waiter and his assistant were good! \n\nFriends have been here and loved it.  Not sure if there's been a change somewhere down the line. We probably won't be back."
1,"This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations! All of the workers are always nice and happy to make your drinks. I generally get the same thing every time, iced chai tea latte, because it's just that amazing. But I wait all year round for anything pumpkin flavored. If you get a chance try their blueberry muffins!!"
1,"I'm probably not the best person to write a review of a Sports Book because I'm not a sports bettor, but I've been here with lots of folks and they seem to love it. The set-up is super nice and it's a great place to watch the races or games. You can also take a seat on one of the counter stools at the adjacent Vig Deli and eat while you watch."
1,"After reading all the rave reviews of this spa, I couldn't resist but booked myself for a massage there after a long week of convention activities. The facility was impeccable and it was great since it was earlier part of the morning. \nThe classic massage ($140) by Aaron was heavenly, he had strong hands but definitely helped eased the knots away from the tight shoulders and also exhausted feet. \n\nThe roman baths were great since I was the only person there. The steam room, the arctic snow room was different with tiny snow flakes failing from the ceiling...in a spa, that's a first time! :)\n\nThe entire facility was top notch, clean and sanitized and definitely comparable to Burke Williams. I would definitely return for a masage again or facial if I return to sin city. \n\nHappy ending, yes! Not that way, silly!"
1,I discovered this little gem out of coincidence when I was invited there for an informal meeting. We decided to go with the food-wine pairing menu and we were not disappointed. The food was nothing short of outstanding and the wine pairing very interesting and at times something I would never have thought of. The service was great and the owner stopped at the table for a long and very informative chat on food and wine among other things. It is a small restaurant so you may want to reserve a table. Great ambiance in this small restaurant.
1,"Very friendly service, clean, good food.  It was just a tad noisy but that's to be expected these days.  We will go back here."
1,"I'm addicted! Although it's super busy and parking is spares, it's so worth it. The protein plates actually come in a bowl and is easily enough food for 2 people or 2 meals"
1,"Well stocked, great service, good fun atmosphere."
0,"Asian fare is all about the sauces and the fresh veggies and meat in my opinion. Chin's fails in all three areas. I guess I learned my first Midwest lesson: when in Wisconsin, eat as the Wisconsinites do!!!"
0,"Ewww.  This place is pretty gross.  I've been here once, and hope to never have to go there again.  Their 'patio' area is just a big smokers den - with ashes all over the seats and tables.  The interior smells funky and I had to wait at the empty bar for about 10 minutes to order my beer...not sure what took the bartender so long since I was the only customer at the time.  My friends lured me here in order to watch a volleyball game, promising cold beverages while watching some fun tourney action (there is a vollyball court out back).  What they failed to mention is that it's not actually part of the bar, so the frosty beverages were enjoyed(?) by myself within the barred enclosure of the patio while my friends sat on the grass about 50 feet away.  Good times I hope not to repeat."
0,"I would love to give 5 stars because their Chinese menu is fantastic. Love the wonton soup. My only complaint is the last 2 times I have gone there for lunch only to be told there would be a 15 minute wait. Mind you, there was only a handful of people in there eating.  While waiting one particular time I watched the hostess do the same to families in which they left and wouldn't wait. We decide to leave as well. The other time we were told the wait was long because the waitress was not very good, she would be very slow. I would appreciate it if I could have made my mind up on the staff. Very unprofessional. I will get her name if I try again for lunch in the future because she should not have a job there dealing with the public."
1,"I wanted a change of venue from Yardhouse for Happy Hour, and Steiner's did not disappoint. They have a great selection of food and booze at extremely reasonable prices. I had their Cuban sandwich which was delicious and several potent drinks. When the bill came I was shocked how much less it was than at Yardhouse. The bartender was friendly and attentive without being awkward and annoying. I would recommend this joint for happy hour.\n\nThe crowd is generally old and although it wasn't smoky that day, smoking is allowed. So beware if you are sensitive."
1,"This is probably the best sushi you can find in the Valley.  The owner is from Japan and I believe they import their fish from Japan.  My husband and I went in, not expecting much from the food, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The pork spare ribs were delectable with a slightly crunchy sweet crust.  We didn't try much else except the fish because it was so darn fresh!\n\nYou need to get here early on weekends because there are not too many tables.  Parking can be tough in the strip mall with the dim sum place next door.  I would give this place four stars but it is pricey for the portions."
0,"Had a horrible experience at this club. My wife and I drove from Chicago to see Above and Beyond a few days ago. We were standing on the balcony and Above and Beyond were getting ready to begin their show. \nA group of 3 Hindu girls and 1 Hindu guy came up and stood next to us, they looked like the typical college students living in Champaign. 1 of the girls was drunk, high and/or a combination of both and began throwing ice from her cup to the people below. Security came up, we pointed her out to the security guard. He gave her a warning. \nAfter he left she continued throwing her ice at the crowd, when the ice ran out she threw her cup !!! The bartenders and the female bar manager saw this happen. \nSecurity came back up and led all 3 Hindu girls and 1 guy out the front door. \n\n3 minutes later the same security guard come up to my wife and I & tells us we have to leave too !!!! We tried to explain to him, the bartender and the bar manager that we were not part of that group. We were standing next to them !!! But we are not together !!! Did they care ??? Would they listen ??? NOOOOO !!!!!  We were unjustly kicked out of the club.\n\nThey denied us the right to plead our case, they would not listen to us !!! Tons of witnesses around did not matter to them !!!!   We were the ones who pointed her out to security !!!!  The staff over there are insane, the bartender and his manager both wear glasses, by the way. It might be time to update their prescription, or they are just plain douchebags. Which one is it ??? \n\nThe moral of this story ?? If you see anyone starting any trouble in this club anywhere near you get the hell out of there before the crazy staff kick you out too !!!"
1,"Fiesta is definitely my favorite of the fast food Mexican places in town. I actually eat their food sober, although after a night in old town the burritos are even tastier, if that's possible. \n\nI usually get a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese and pico. Their carne asada is pretty good too, but it tastes more like ground beef than steak to me. I like to add rice and get a side of sour cream, and for a mere $5 they are definitely filling. \n\nMy only gripe is that Fiesta isn't open 24/7 or offer the late night hours that some of the other -beto's do (they're open til 3am on Friday which is great, but 2am on Saturdays and 1am during the week). I work at a bar and sometimes don't get off work until 2:30 or 3am and am disappointed when Fiesta is closed \""early\""."
0,"OK, but would not try again.  Ordered a ham and cheese sandwich on wheat bread, with chips and bottled water.  Total was $12+.  The sandwich itself was incredibly ordinary.  It did come with crunchy dill pickles, which were nice to chomp on.  They did not ask if I wanted my bread toasted.  \n\nLimited seating.  I sat in the sports book area adjacent.  \n\nAccepts credit cards.  Had a few other sandwich choices - Reuben, pastrami, turkey.  A pre-packaged salad.  Krispy Kreme Donuts.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  No thanks.  I like the sandwiches from 7-11 better."
0,"I would advise customers at the salon to beware of Chelsea. She seems like a brand new hair stylist that needs to learn a little bit more about how to treat customers. I was straightforward about what I wanted done to my hair (my usual color that I get from another stylist there) and she confused the hell out of me and didn't really give me a chance to explain what I wanted. \n\nShe gave me a list of swatches and I pointed to the color I wanted and said \""there, I'd like highlights of that color\"". My hair turned out much darker than the color I picked. I stayed to get it fixed but the way she was talking to me was quite condescending and she tried to put the blame on me, saying I should have either paid more or explained better. Shouldn't have given her a tip! I would never treat a customer like that.\n\nAll in all, make sure when you like a stylist, you stick with her or pay a little extra for Nicole :)"
0,"As Misti, our Las Vegas CM, mentioned you could come here and chill and read a book and have some food or a beverage.\n\nHowever,... \n\nThe atmosphere is less than desirable. Yes, there are couches. Yes there's some tables. But the place needs more color and sound. I asked the manager to put on some music in the future. They had a movie playing on the TV when I arrived. Totally not a movie I would associate with Elixir, mindful eating or general well-being. Like,... put on a surfing movie at least. Not National Lampoon's European Vacation!\n\nThe space reminds me of a cafe that used to be in the Lower Haight in San Francisco called, \""Common Ground.\"" The coffee was good. The music (which ranged from Reggae to Indy-rock) was decent and there were some good food choices. This place needs to embrace their cafe/ lounge attitude and play some darn music!\n\nThe Caesar salad was fair. The blue cheese burger was overcooked like... well, well done, and I wasn't asked a temperature by the server. The server didn't bring enough setups and I was given the reasoning that the table was small so they try to conserve. Um... utensils are utensils. I need them to eat.\n\nSome things should just be a given when it comes to service.\nI think she saw two entrees ordered and brought just two setups because of it. But.... there were 3 of us. And yes, I had to ask for an extra plate. Good service should predict a customers needs. This place needs some serious training.\n\nBack to the food... as someone else said, they have good intentions. I liked the choices of bread, meats and veggie options for their burgers. Presentation of the food needs some work. Right now, I might as well be at the Waffle House and not a healthy choice restaurant.\n\nWith competition like Greens and Protein and the Raw Cafe, this place is going to need to pull it together with their atmosphere, service and food in order to stay in the game."
1,"Service was a bit spotty, but I don't think they expected to be slammed right at 11am on a Sunday.  It took a VERY long time to get the check, we were there for nearly 90 minutes, but, since we weren't in a rush it wasn't a big deal.  The green chili quesadilla is the BEST EVER, just make sure they use green chili (as in meat) instead of green chiles.  It took a while to get it to our table since the chili was still being made, but the flavor was out of this world!  There was a smoky grilled flavor that I've never had on any other dish which just sent it out of the world.  \n\nGollo Burro, chili verde, enchilada style.  You need NOTHING else.  I ordered that and my table was eating off of my plate instead of enjoying their food--it was that good.  Machaca burro is also extremely tasty.  \n\nHooray for a local, family run restaurant.  You will NOT find queso dip, pollo fundito, or any of those 'Mexican chain gang' restaurant foods here.  This is simple, hearty food and you can tell they love what they do by the quality and taste in each dish.  Returning soon!"
1,"Fantastic synergy of Chinese & Latin American cuisine (merging the owners' worlds).  Build your own combinations, then choose to have it served in bowls/burritos or with quesadillas. The ordering process can take a few minutes to figure out but they're patient and offer free samples of the dishes and sauces to help you decide. \n\nThe Emerald Chicken is a great example of their fusion menu. It's tender, skinless grilled chicken served with a light ginger green onion sauce. I chose to have it over Jerk Chicken Rice (Chinese-style fried rice w/ Jamaican Jerk Chicken & green onions... Yum!). You can also opt for plain white rice, yet trust me, the Jerk Chicken is bomb-lish-ish.\n\nSince I made my own 2-dish combo, got the famous Jade Chicken with it.  This is a lightly deep-fried chicken served with an Asian sweet sauce. I'm a fan of both these dishes. You also have your choice of beans. As per most people I know who eat here, the black beans win. \n\nFantastic fusion food!  5 star food experience, yet I'm giving 4 starts since ambience is a part of the overall food experience when ordering out."
1,"This place is less than a mile from Vegas' downtown Fremont Experience. Once you leave the experience, the neighborhood looks really sketchy. But there's nothing to be afraid of if you act like a normal person & not a scared tourist. Me & the hubby walked there from the experience.  It's looks like a cowboy club inside & out but they play all types of music. We were there for a punk band.  I guess the punk scene is not big in Vegas, seemed only a few regulars there for a Saturday night.  We still had a load of fun and the bartenders were attentive & quick when serving me. I would get to the bar and one bartender remembered what I last ordered & had my next round ready for me before I even opened my mouth. That was great, lol. I would definitely go there again for another punk show when in Vegas."
1,"amazing gnocchi, amazing salmon and sea bass, AMAZING chocolate souffle. GET THE TRUFFLED CHIPS...FOODGASSMMMM. \nyeah wolfgang puck has overexpanded, but he neverh as disappointed me...even his fast food express places. the server was sooo funny and nice. the decor is simple but u forget everything when u just taste their food. really worth it!"
0,"Has a convenient location and it is fresher than other Paradise bakeries, however experience is absolutely ruin by bad customer service.  There  is very few people that have customer service here as compared to other locations, most of them are guys! I'm never coming back to this location thanks to the cashier named Lirio."
1,"This is the ONLY pizza place in Tempe as far as I'm concerned. Great crust, sauce and cheese. They do skimp on the toppings but they serve Frank's hot sauce. So that is a huge plus. I freggin' love that stuff."
0,"VW has big ambitions for America. They want to significantly increase sales and produce the best mass-produced cars on American roads. Some have said they want to become the next Toyota (though that ambition now seems less austere). \n\nThe reality is, however, that they have no chance of doing that if people receive the kind of poor service that my girlfriend received from the Chapman VW service department last November.\n\nIn short, there was a transmission problem and though this should have been covered under a VW 10yr/100K powertrain warranty for her 2000 Beetle, the dealership would not honor this, and instead claiming that the issue was not covered.\n\nIn the end, the dealership charged her $568.07 for a fix that took nearly two business weeks to complete, during which time my girlfriend was without car. All the while, the service advisor, Kevin Fore treated my girlfriend with the kind of contempt and disregard that should have gone out with the age of feminism. To top it off, the mechanics left grease on the yellow interior paintwork. Classy.\n\nSo in short, shitty customer service + poor service time + $120/hr labor= recipe for disaster. VW would best be served to cease business with this dealer immediately. Run, don't walk VW!"
0,"The positive things about this place would definitely be the beds they were very comfortable. But they put throw pillows on the perfectly clean bed which is really nasty they look like they have never been cleaned and the first thing I do is knock them on the floor like everybody else.\nThe negative would be about everything else; we had a room with two double beds and the room was just to small for two beds, my husband and I kept hitting our shins on the corner of the beds. The bathrooms were in pretty bad shape. I say bathrooms because we had plumbing issues and had to move rooms, so both bathrooms were old and in need of repair."
1,A dream come true after watching Carlo's Bakery on TV for years.  Service was good and food was amazing from the bread to the entree to dessert.  Had Madeline's Whole Wheat Penne and then Cannoli for dessert.  Just as good as I had hoped it would be.  Clever interior with rolling pins hanging and whisks on the light fixtures.  Family photo album in the dessert menu.  Great option for getting dessert since the bakery across the hall is always so busy.
0,"I've been here a couple of times and I still don't get the hype. The food is decent but nothing special compared to any other Tex-Mex restaurants in Charlotte. Their tableside guacamole was good and they did make it very spicy like we asked. And their jalepeno margaritas are delicious. But their actual dishes are just whatever. \n\nOne reason I'm knocking them down to two stars is their service. The first time I went, the girl seemed very irritated that we were in there so late (only an hour and a half before they closed. Geez). The second time, the guy kept acting like any request we made was a joke. \""can we get the tableside guac?\"" \""ha...sure. ....oh really?\"" i know it was kind of busy but we are very patient and very good tippers so we were serious. Then when I asked for a box for my quesadillas, I also asked for a side of sour cream and salsa. (to which he replied \""to eat here? Hahah ok?\"" \""no....for home\"" what a weird question) The box came out about 15 minutes later and was just thrown down as he was walking to the next table. I then had to ask for the sides again. We had already paid and everything and after another 15 minutes of nothing, we just left.\n\nI want to give them one more chance as far as service goes bc it's the only neighborhood Mexican restaurant and I want to experience what everyone else has experienced. But I'm serious...one more chance.."
0,"I got the lamb kebab and 5 mins after I took a bite I had to pull over and throw up, NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
0,"I had seen some decent reviews on this place so I decided to hit it up. Not impressed. Was kind of expensive for the AUCE option, $25 a person as the selection looked like it was not very good. I went with ala cart and was not impressed with anything. It was all very sweet with sauces and just not high quality. Would not repeat and I should know better hitting a place on the strip like that! LOL.. worth a try.."
1,"So I sit down and get an ice cold dos xx to get started after a stressed out day. My day was already getting better. The miso soup was delicious, The bartender recommends a roll called \""limon roll\"" and it was like he knew my taste buds. AMAZING!!!!!!! This roll didn't need Anything else, no soy, no sauce, no nothing. I get another beer, drink a glass of water, and I was on my way. Good experience I recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi or Mexican food (the tacos looked good) lol"
1,"This is a great hotel for the price (only $100/night!). Compared to some of the other newer hotels, it's looking a little tired. Everyone is friendly and helpful, the concierge definitely got used. I'm sure they were a little tired of us by the time we left, but they were so helpful in finding exactly what we were looking for, even if it was in other hotels.\n\nThe rooms were huge with great views. Be careful when you go near the mini fridge! Everything on there has a sensor and the maids check the sensors daily. If anything has been moved, you get charged. Unfortunately, that makes using the mini fridge as an actual fridge impossible. The maid told us we could call the front desk and get a real fridge brought up, but in the end it wasn't worth it.\n\nThe pool is very nice. Surprisingly, the pool wasn't that crowded. Everyone was tanning, with very few people swimming, which made playing in the waterfall pretty awesome. There are also several hot tubs hidden around the main pool. They are huge and claim to have a capacity of 15 people, but you could easily fit double that amount. I thought about going to their new topless pool Bare. I stopped by the tent, but they were playing \""Big Pimpin'\"" loudly and there was a skeezy guy standing in front, so I decided to pass.\n\nMy only complaint with the actual hotel is the distance from my room to the elevator. There are 45 rooms on each wing on each floor. And of course I was the one who had to walk past all 44 rooms to get to the end. Generally I wouldn't have cared so much, except I was in tourist mode, walking everywhere and trying to fit everything in. By the end of the day I was exhausted and the hallway was so long. When you check in, ask for something close to the elevators.\n\nAlso, if you're really into the volcano out front, you need to be prepared: the volcano is being remodeled and won't reopen until October."
1,"This is a great hotel. Everything is very clean and updated. The Wifi is good the staff is super friendly & accommodating. \nThis hotel is away from the strip but there is a hourly shuttle that will take you to Planet Hollywood.\nThe pool is outdoor and very nice.\nThis will sound strange but they have one of the best breakfast bars I have ever seen in a hotel. Fully equipped with fruits, steel cut oats with tons of toppings, breakfast sandwiches and starbucks brewed coffee.\nHad an 8 month old baby with us on this trip and had absolutely no problems with noise or anything. The shuttle drivers even let us bring our carseat on so it was easy for us to get the baby back and forth to the strip. \nLong story short, I liked this hotel."
0,"Very disappointing. We enjoyed Olive and thought we'd try this new place and it is no where close to the same quality. Great beer on tap selection but the chicken pot pie was just a step above acceptable with a thick biscuit top rather than the flaky pastry top normally used. The chicken seemed like it was cut months ago and very little vegetables. Not what I expected and apparently the same for others as it was virtually empty on a Friday evening. Wings special appetizer wasn't bad, but the Bleu Cheese dressing was only OK. Go to Olives if you need an English fix!"
0,"Trippers, all of you other reviewers. \n\nThis place has a bad name. Should be called \""Cafe Cul-de-Sac\"". There is nothing cosmopolitan about this place, or their menu. Save your dollars, unless you feel the need to torture yourself."
0,"Here for a baseball tournament. Lots of talk about Raul and Theresa's among attendees. Guess the people I was listening to have never had good Mexican restaurant food as Raul and Theresa's Mexican food is as pedestrian as it gets. We had three different dishes; chile verde,green and red burrito and a taco combo plate. No plate was finished. We are a Mexican family with old family roots that produce some outing dishes. We try not to compare restaurant food with home cooked as nothing compares to home cooked but we do have a base to compare. And, Raul and Theresa's does not make the grade for authentic or good tasting Mexican fare. Good service, nice setting, little out of the way and not worth the trouble."
0,"Rip-off. Quoted me $5900 to replace a failed A/C system. I responded that's too much. The guy went on to explain that they were going to replace condenser, coil and furnace. The furnace was not failing. Without furnace their quote was $4480. Then I called the highest rated AC repair company here on Yelp and their quote was $3500."
0,"We ate their twice and both times had serious red flags and worse. Perhaps my wife would say only one star for Solo Trattoria.\nOn the first visit the waitress had bold face lied and told us their food was organic and non-gmo. We researched later and found they are neither. At both visits I had indigestion- it was light, but I haven't had it in many years. They add chemicals and heap on unhealthy ingredients to improve the richness and taste of their food- and we are in the position to know!! We will never return to this so-called italian gourmet restaurant.Their food is dirty and very suspicious. Giving two stars for the ambiance and the price we paid thru groupon."
0,"Ate at the Grandview Buffet on a Friday evening.  We were disappointed from start to finish.  To begin our dining experience, we were sat at a table that had not been properly cleaned (both the table and chairs were dirty)  Then, we proceeded to the buffet.  The quality is far, far below what was expected for the price: $26.95/person.  The shrimp was overcooked, the salmon was dry, the crab legs were small (even small for snow crab) and nothing great.\n\nWe didn't try the American or BBQ offerings - the reason we went was \""seafood Friday\"".  Perhaps those choices are better, but based upon this experience we would not hold our breath.\n\nI'm giving two stars because we had a great guy clearing our table and checking our drinks.  He was the only one really hustling as most of the other floor staff were standing about the cashiers table watching the clock."

1,Before i really didnt like burberry cuz it always didnt have the size or the stuff i wanted but now i can find all the thing i want from burberry. its a great store.
0,"Sadly, I think the last time I dined here was my last.  I always feel gross after ingesting items off of their soy-filled menu. So, I tried a salad and was utterly disappointed.  When it comes down to it, I'd rather spend my money on real food, not fake meat and fake cheese and fake this and that.  \n\nKeep it real...er...well, you just keep it."
0,"I really want to like this place.\n\nFirst impressions and customer service influence my perception of a hotel.  I had a three night stay during mid-March after spending several nights on the Strip. It's about a 25-30 minute drive from the Strip on the interstate. It's not that difficult to get to from the Strip; on a return trip, coming out of the Aliante, you have to quickly get into the right lane to enter 251 West, drive several miles to I95 South and remain vigilant so you don't miss the I95 South interstate entrance ramp going back to the Strip. The property is gorgeous and resembles a miniature Red Rock Hotel and Casino. Registration is a distance from the casino and there is an assortment of restaurants and a food court near a large movie theater. There is ample parking.\n\nUpon arriving to the hotel, three burly security guards watched me struggle with opening the large glass doors to registration, and did nothing to help. Approaching the registration desk, I was greeted with \""you checkin in?\"" I reiterated my room request, \""King bed, no smoking on a high floor without a direct view of another building, parking garage, rooftops or heating and air conditioning units. I walked to my room continuing to notice how attractive the registration area, elevators and hallways were. The room was well decorated and beautiful. There was a large, fully tiled shower with glass doors and a boutique styled sink. There was no bathtub. There was a 42 inch plasma television, but unfortunately, numerous channels either pixilated or did not come in at all. \n\nThe carpets, drapes and curtains appeared new and well maintained. I drew the drapes and curtain and, unfortunately, I had an excellent view of a roof top and a series of heating and air conditioning units. I immediately dialed the operator to reach the front desk.  A reservation agent answered and feebly attempted to placate me. She indicated that the hotel was sold out for the night, I could be moved to another room the next day and that all the rooms in this price point had a view of the rooftop and heating and air conditioning units (yes she said ALL). I refused to accept her explanation and asked to speak with the front desk. She placed me on hold for some ten minutes, returned and told me the front desk reiterated what she'd stated to me. After complaining that she did not connect me to the front desk, I asked to speak with a manager and waited about 15 minutes for her call. She gave me the same run around. Unbelievably, all the deluxe rooms reportedly have the same view. She was silent when I asked why this information is not contained on the website or when reservations are made. However, for an additional $10 per night, she would happily send someone to assist me with my luggage and relocate me to an upgraded room. (But I thought the hotel was sold out.) I told her it was a matter of principle and that I would remain in my current room.\n\nThe Medley Buffet is very reasonably priced.  It is a little more than an average buffet, but for the price, it is excellent. Customer service at the buffet was great!\n\nThe exercise room is located on the second floor and overlooks the pool, which is quite attractive. The exercise room was clean and had a very nice array of weight machines, bicycles, cross trainers and treadmills. Equipment was adequately spaced for safety and the room was not crowded.  Nothing was broken!\n\nThe casino is smoky and over my four day stay I found the slot machines somewhat tight. On a Friday, at about 6:30 pm, I did discover a Wheel of Fortune slot machine that was kind enough to allow me to play continuously for about 90 minutes racking up Players Card points until I finally lost my winnings and initial investment. It was worth it. Unfortunately, this is where I experienced some really bad drink service. For literally one hour, a cocktail server did not come by the slot machine bay. Others across the casino made eye contact with me as I attempted to \""wave to them\"" to let them know I'd like to order drinks, but was ignored. I spoke to no fewer than four employees, supervisors, who passed by, asking them to send a server to our area. I spoke to one supervisor twice and she used her \""walkie-talkie\"" to make someone aware to send a server to a specific slot machine. No one came.  Eventually, a business suited manager appeared who was ushering a server through the casino. Thankfully, they stopped by and I ordered drinks and continued to play the slot machine. Unfortunately, after 25 minutes of waiting, I called it a night and left.  \n\nOn Saturday, I went to the Bistro 57 Restaurant Bar to watch the NCAA Basketball tournament. The d\u00e9cor is very nice and inviting.  I ran a tab and stayed for some two hours, before leaving.  The customer service was efficient, but not friendly.\n\nAll in all, I really want to like this place; d\u00e9cor and amenities - excellent; customer service - zero."
0,"No stars but since Yelp won't let me post without giving a rating, I'll give 1 by default only.WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER GIVE THIS COMPANY MY BUSINESS AGAIN!!!!!!!! POOR SERVICE, NO PROFESSIONALISM AND I SUPPOSE THE NEW OWNERS JACKSON OIL IS AS MUCH OF A CROOK, A LIAR & SNAKE IN THE GRASS AS THE PREVIOUS CONVICT OWNER!!!!!!!Stopped by Danny's family car wash at 4027 Gilbert Rd onTuesday December the 16th 2014. I live in Maricopa city which is about 40 miles from the location I happen to be in the area getting new tires at Discount Tires. I was planning on getting the VIP service when the young man talk to me into a detail which included seat cleaning carpets and mats door - and console cleaning fabric protector and he threw in a headlight restoration and of course the VIP wash the price for this was $105.99. I got there a little bit be after 2pm my service washer as stated on receipt was Eric # 463001. Eric tells me it will be about 2 hrs. 3 1/2 hours later the manger of the detail area comes inside to get me. He explains that the only got one of the headlights restored and that took several hours they were closing and asked me to return the next morning to finish the other headlight the other manager spoke up and said and we will give her a free wax job. I agreed with a time of 10 AM & showed up the next morning at 10 AM no bays were opened. I waited a little while called the number on receipt. They had two options car wash or convenient store I called the car wash and no one answered so I called the convenient store the manager there informs me that the car wash was closed for the day due to weather even tho the skies are clear blue and there is sunshine. There was some drizzle earlier in the morning. But this is Arizona did they expect a snow storm to come through maybe a hurricane I'm not sure. I do know I drove 40 miles one way to get my car finished because I was asked by the manager. They open at 7:30 in the morning and Roy the manager will be getting a call from me and I just hope that I have calmed down a bit and I can speak to him in a reasonable adult manner and he will represent his company and make good for what he has done."
1,"Everyone is chill in this shop, Amazing Artists. Got a piece done by Rocky cool dude. Already have a 2nd tattoo scheduled with him. If you're looking to get some good ink done this is def the place to go. Only place I'll get tatted while in Arizona."
1,"Delicious! spent the last Mother Day there and it was a great spread! It is pricey, but worth the interesting, exotic but oh so good flavors. \nGood Happy Hour all night at the bar area, I recommend the chicken lollipops. I usually do not like dark meat chicken, but I would eat this again and again!!! \nService was polite and friendly."

0,"Not a gambler, but enjoyed Vegas' casinos when I went about 3 years ago.  They were not smokey, ashtray lined venues (NYNY smelled like apples, Mandalay bay like coconuts, you get the picture).  This place  was so smoke filled it was disgusting.  Will not ever go back!\n\nFor those who want to try it--we were dressed up, but there were those in sweats and blue jeans, and those in furs (although not many).  Anything goes, just be sure you have your ID."
1,"I'm a big fan of the way they do things at Teriyaki madness. It's really nothing special, especially if you've ever visited a franchise known as The Flame Broiler back in California. But what these guys do, they do quite well.\n\nI usually get their chicken rice bowl with brown rice and extra hot sauce on the side. I suppose I could order their spicy bowl, but I don't see the point of paying extra for it when I can get the same sauce they presumably use to marinate their meat for free right next to the drink fountain. And the combination of their salty teriyaki glaze with the spicy tang of sriracha is just too addicting to pass up. \nYou can get their chicken veggie bowl if you want to moderate the meat consumption a little bit...but I can't bring myself to do that. \n\nIt's not the cheapest place to go for a quick bite at over 7 dollars a bowl, but you do get what you pay for. The portions are impressive and I guarantee you will be full if you can finish the whole thing. It's a popular choice among weightlifters or other fitness savvy folk and I think it's no mistake that these stores tend to be located next to gyms. It doesn't look particularly impressive inside but I highly suggest you order some carryout from this place and eat in a location catered to your comfort so that you can fully appreciate how good this grub can be."
0,"As a Brit I was embarrassed to eat here.. It was terrible. Overpriced ($10 for a side of chips/ potatoes) food not freshly prepared dry and not very warm snapper, mussels and clams old and cold. Very disappointing everything Gordon Ramsey tells establishments not to do. a wine lst that belongs in a 5 star  restaurant not a bar.  And I wish he would stop using the British flag he is not representing the average Brit."
0,No customer service at all.\nService is really bad. I will never go there anymore waste my time n money.
0,"Now I've never been to Chicago and I've never had the deep dish, so I'm probably not the best person to be writing this review, but I'm still going to put in my thoughts! Not bad, but not good, either. What really ruined it for me was the cheese. It was just, rubbery. I don't think any kind of pizza should have rubbery cheese. That's a huge no-no for me. The crust was good, though. I liked the balance of softness and crispy."
1,"My wife surprised the kids and I with a Birthday Helicopter Tour of Phoenix with Dryden Helicopters! She got a great deal on a Groupon for a 20 minute tour. Our son has said he wants to be a Helicopter Policeman when he grows up, so the tour was especially great!  Dryden also offers a Holiday Lights Tour, right now (10/22/2011) it's on Groupon Phoenix too!\n\nWe easily setup our appointment via Dryden's website (we even rescheduled it really easy)!  We got a confirmation email from their site a day before too, really nice! We even spoke with Mike the owner pilot, he answered all our questions and make us even more excited to take our tour.\n\nWe called Mike when we pulled into the address, 7430 E. Butherus Drive, Scottsdale, there's no building directory in the parking lot, he let us know they were in Suite C. Also the Yelp-Trip Advisor address for Dryden Helicopters is incorrect they are not at 19856 N. 84th St!\n\nMike introduced himself to all of us, even shaking both our kids' hands.  He engaged both our children and started the paperwork. Yes we did have to tell him our weights, he needs it for the flight specs.  It all took about 5 minutes and we were headed to the helicopter pad just behind the building.  We took a couple of photos, buckled up, put on the headphones, closed the doors and we were asking for clearance to FLY!\n\nWe lifted off and flew over Kierland Commons , then through Dreamy Draw, over Squaw Peak and around Camelback Mountain.  We took pictures of hikers and hikers took pictures of us, our daughter loved it.  We asked and Mike flew us over the new Diamonbacks training facilities, they were awesome.\n\nOverall we had an awesome time.  Our son who doesn't stop chattering was speechless! Our daughter got to ride in the front with Mike and was in heaven!  The flight was a different experience, no weird tummy feelings, just a slight rotational shake. If you get a chance to take a Tour with Dryden Helicopters, sign up and take the flight!"
1,"Real Mexican food. The tortas are wonderful and reasonably priced. If you have not had a Mexican sandwich before, let me introduce you to The Torta. Carne asada, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocado, on a soft roll. No mustard or mayo. Yummy and a $4.99 a filling lunch."
1,This place has become a top favorite in a very short period! They have amazing fresh food that tastes home cooked! Abs every time I have been here the staff has Ben super friendly and attentive. Weekends there is just about always a wait when I come for breakfast but it's so worth it. I would def recommend this place. Support a small business and get amazing food with huge portions and friend budgets doesn't get better then that! And for my bacon lovers out there you must try the bacon on it's own!! Super thick and crispy goodness!!
0,"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are nice. That's what the 1 star is for. The front desk crew are not helpful and lie to guests. If you don't know something, ask someone and make an effort. We were treated like trash. Be careful if you have a promotion. They will try to not give it to you. We ate at the 24 hour restaurant and they were doing construction while we ate. Food was okay but who wants to hear drilling while they eat? This hotel has the worst customer service I've ever received. They need to train their staff better and get rid of dead weight."
1,"Peter (Big Elvis) is without doubt one of the best shows I have seen in Vegas, and I have paid to see some of the bigger shows. His voice is amazing, not only did he sing Elvis songs but he also sang Lois Armstrong. \n\nIn summary a must see in Vegas, certainly gave me that feel good factor and goose pimples on my neck 10 out of 10."
0,"I know people will still come and eat here even after reading all the horrid reviews.. But seriously though, this place has a bunch of dumbasses working here. I called around 10:35 at night no one picked up... I called back in ten minutes... No answer... By the way, all this is happening\nEhile driving there...I end getting  there and see all the workers outside smoking.. No one was inside at all! The phone was ringing off the hook. Customers were waiting for their pizza also. This will be the last time I ever come here ever. \n\nDear Management if you are reading this, I advise you to fix this piece of shit location. I am currently typing this as I wait for my pizza in this crap establishment, my pizza better be good."
1,"I have been consistently going to Nicole for a few years now and I would highly recommend Healthy Skin by Nicole to anyone! Since I started getting treatments from Nicole, I constantly receive compliments on how great my skin looks! It literally gives off a glow and feels as smooth as baby's skin. \n\nI am 26 years old and I primarily go to Nicole to prevent aging, reduce breakouts, and keep that radiant skin or \""glow\"" people tell me I have. \n\nShe always recommends what is best for your skin and modifies her treatments based on what she feels your skin needs at the moment. I also leave her boutique spa feeling pampered and relaxed because her treatments are always so soothing and calming!\n\nNicole is incredibly talented at what she does! I have known many of her other clients and they range from all ages, have different skin types, and are both male and female. Whether you are a man or a woman, old or young, have troublesome skin or \""good\"" skin, you should definitely go see Nicole! \n\nOn top of all the great things I mentioned above, she has an open range of hours that works for me and for most 9-5'ers. She is flexible and tries to make it as convenient for me to come in for my appointments. \n\nAND...She has awesome prices!!!\n\nI refuse to go to anyone else! I drive all the way from Chandler just to see her!"
1,"Don't judge me.\n\nI must confess, I thought the cupcake rage was a fad that would fade quickly.  No, strike that; I WANTED the fad the fade quickly.  Most places I tried seemed too focused on making their frosting taste good and not enough on making the cupcake moist and tasty to stand in its own.  In fact, some places had more frosting than cupcake (*cough*Tammie Coe*cough*)!\n\nBring it back over a year ago and I walked into Caked to try their wares.  Frankly, I was not impressed.  It was ok, but Duncan Heins made better.  \n\nFlash forward to last week.  Coming out of Sushi Mon I was hungry for desert (AYCE just isn't the same anymore when it's not AYCE desert...but that's a discussion for another review).  Anyway, we strolled on over to Caked and I was only going to grab one cupcake (I need to watch my figure).  But the smell of sweet treats called to me and my eyes started to get bigger as I looked longingly into the display case.  EYES = O.O     stomach = o\n\nEach was $2.75:\n\n   Red Velvet (x2) - probably my least favorite.  The frosting was light and tasty, but the cupcake left me wanting a bit more flavor.  Not sure whether the frosting just outshone the cupcake or if the cupcake didn't have much flavor.  I'll be back to try again.  :)  \n\n   Carrot cake (x2) - Definitely my family's (and mine) favorite.  REALLY moist and tasty cake.  The frosting was just right: not too heavy and thick like most actual cakes have.  \n\n   DQ (x2) - Basically a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting, which is dipped in a chocolate shell like Dairy Queen (hence the name, duh).  Wasn't sure about this one because it seemed so plain, but it had sprinkles to please the kids so we got it.  This ended up being really flavorful.  The cupcake was really moist and chocolatey, but not so rich that you needed to wash every bite down with milk.  The frosting was a bit hard and too sweet for my tastebuds, but the fam didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n   Vanilla - hey, don't judge...it was a request by my daughter.  As usual, I didn't get a bite.  My girl ate it all up (frosting first, of course).\n\n   Mocha (x2) - my pick at the shop and one I will have to be back for.  Had a light, but distinct mocha flavor (duh, right?).  I could honestly do without the frosting because the cupcake could hold it's own.  \n\nAfter pigging out at Sushi Mon and stuffing our faces with cupcakes, we had one leftover DQ that sat in the fridge for 2 days.  Not sure if my wife was hiding it from me...  Anyway, upon discovery by me, I promptly ran to a dark corner of the house and ate it.  To my surprise, it was no less tasty or moist than on that first day.  If that's not a testament, I don't know what is.  I ordered 9, but if I had known the would keep well, I would have gotten a dozen.  \n\nI'm really glad I gave this shop another shot - my original judgement was premature.  Not only did it change my mind about the place, it changed my opinion of cupcakes, in general."
0,"We were out shopping and it was lunch time so we stopped in here without checking yelp. Big Mistake.\n\nIt's not that the food was awful, it's not that the service was awful. It's just that it was just \""meh\"" and I'm being kind.\n\nI had a half pastrami sandwich on rye (which was a bit dry), matzo ball soup (which was flavorless) and cole slaw (which had way too much vinegar). My wife had half corned beef on rye (the bread was dry but moistened up because the meat was fatty), a side of veggies (boiled the taste out of them) and barley/chicken soup (so-so, but tasted like canned soup).\n\nThe good news is that all of the above with two drinks was only $21.\nIf you're in the mood for Jewish Deli - go to Chompies."
1,Great small Pizza Hut! Nice staff and very efficient.\n\nI like that there system remembers your previous orders so it makes ordering very quick. \n\nThe one item that is memorable is that I ordered online once and under special instructions I asked them I wish my son a happy birthday and they really did it! My son was so happy they drew a cake and all on the box!
1,"I own a property management company in Phoenix and I use Scent from Above for all property move outs and move ins.  I will summarize my satisfaction as follows:  I have never had a tenant call me at move in stating the property needs cleaning after Scent From Above has been there.  Makes my job easier, I am very pleased!"
1,"Before I found out \""Cibo\"" means \""food\"" in Italian, I thought it was a Mexican restaurant, deceived by its extraordinarily cute exterior. \n\nCibo is, on the most part, a pizza place. The parking lot is full of very nice BMWs and Audis. So it must have done something right.\n\nThe pizzas at Cibo remind me a lot of those at La Grande Orange: gourmet toppings, thin sourdough crust, and fragrant cheese. We ordered three pizzas for the table, all tasted great, except that... they were awfully similar. \n\nGranted, I probably shouldn't expect too much of a variety when we were having pizzas (for a birthday celebration), but I was hoping for something life-changing, like the slice of pizza I had in Rome. Well, Cibo is no food hauled from Rome for sure, but it is nonetheless a good place to chill and get solid food in central Phoenix."
1,Had lunch. Food was good. Had their special salad. Service was great. Not hovering so we could talk.
1,"Stopped here for a quick bite before the club. We ate at the bar and the bartender was nice and accommodating. \n\nFood was pretty good but portions were small. I got the lobster tacos and although the menu stated that it was 3 tacos,  the amount of lobster I received only fit 2 tacos. The lobster was definitely fresh and delicious though. \n\nI'd go back, but probably order something more like a Burrito,  where portion size would be standard."
1,"Best nail salon in Las Vegas!! I go every 2 weeks. Every tech is good, whether your getting your nails or toes done. The manager is great she does great eye brow waxing."
1,"My husband and I ordered the special dinner for two which included soup, appetizers, two entrees and rice.  The egg drop soup was good, the appetizer platter was so much food but by the time we finished it, we were too full to eat our dinners other than just taste them. We got teriyaki chicken and kung pao chicken and both were very good, although we wished the teriyaki glaze would have been thicker. The ingredients in the entrees were very fresh and nice. Service was courteous and prompt, as was the food. We got to go boxes and have enough food left over for lunch tomorrow. We will definitely go back there again the next time we are in the mood for Asian food."
0,"I think US Airways policy of charging for drinks (unless you happen to like Bud or Bud Light) sucks monumentally.  If someone pays $50 to get a day pass, they shouldn't have to pay for a decent import or a glass of wine that doesn't resembles colored battery acid.  Yes this Charlotte club is spacious (but also full of traffic come rush hour), but that and a fancy coffee machine is not sufficient justification for the charge.  And the staff - what can I say?  They're not nicknamed \""US Scare\"" for no reason.  This is the third time I've been \""burned\"" by them, and I will even try more to avoid - but in a place like CLT, it's as inevitable as death and taxes - and just about as desirable."
0,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered a chicken fajita and it was hands down the worse I ever had. The chicken was extremely dry flavorless and chopped up into teeny tiny pieces and was mixed with slivers of onions and peppers. The worst part was the warm goop that I assume was guacamole based on the dark green color. It had the same flavor and consistency of the sour cream. Last but not least, the horchata was watered down and gritty. This place is definitely no bueno"
0,"The theaters are clean, the selection of movies and snacks are usually pretty good.\n\nThe low rating is due to their inability to maintain the audio equipment to have 'assisted hearing devices'.  I suspect that they just don't ever bother to fix them, and it's kind of disgusting because it shows a complete lack of respect and courtesy toward handicapped patrons.  I'd be a little more tolerant if it wasn't the third time it happened.  (Shame on me for thinking things would be fixed, after we boycotted for a year or so...)\n\nWhen told that their equipment isn't working, they just shrug.  A refund was halfheartedly offered after three sets of new equipment (which I'm pretty sure they knew wouldn't work.) but I would've had to leave immediately and my husband was enjoying the movie.\n\nTo contrast, a similar situation happened at the Waterworks Cinema (which is old fashioned by comparison).  When informed that the assisted hearing device wasn't working, the manager was profusely apologetic, insisted on giving us 2 passes that not only were for free admission but any concessions we wanted.  And, oh yeah?  The problem was fixed the next time we returned."
0,"Not a very authentic Irish Pub, but then again I have never ever been to Ireland, so what  do I know about real Irish Pubs? What I can do is compare McFadden's to other Pubs that  I have been to, and all I can say is, meh. I would not even call this place a pub at all. Heck, they don't even refer to themselves as a Pub. The restaurants actual name is McFadden's Restaurant and Saloon. Isn't Saloon an old west term? \n\nMy Girfriend and I visted this place on a Thurs. night. They had the whole dueling piano thing going on that night and later on  they had what they called a \""White Trash Bash\"". $1000 went to the girl they crowned Miss White Trash. We were not interested and left after we finished our meal. Speaking of meals. Their menu included things like pizza, pasta primavera, shepard's pie, egg plant parmesan, St. Louis BBQ ribs, burgers and a Reuben sandwich. I had the Reuben, which was good, but flat like a panini sandwich. It came with shoe string fries that were obviously straight from the freezer. My Girlfriend had the Pasta Primevera. Pasta Primevera in what suppose to be a Irish restaurant? She did enjoy it though. The penne pasta was tossed with garden vegetables, a heavy amount of marinara sauce and garlic bread on the side.\n\n I'm gonna have to give this place 2 stars because, \""Meh, I've experienced better\"". We were looking for Irish and what we got was a complete poser pub that served Italian. Italian?"
1,"My roommate and I decided to splurge and treat ourselves to a nice dinner during Pittsburgh's 2014 winter restaurant week. After much deliberation, we chose Up because neither of us have been before, and its short walking distance from our apartment didn't hurt. We both chose the prix fixe menu they were offering for restaurant week, and I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful our meal was. I started off with an arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts that was lightly dressed, but the star of the show was my entr\u00e9e, the rosemary chicken with polenta. We finished our meal with a light limoncello sorbet and a glass of prosecco. There were no survivors at that meal. Best part? The prix fixe menu items are all from their regular seasonal menu. I will definitely be back for a special occasion!"
1,"Our Foodie Adventure has just begun!!!  Had dinner at The Harvest Restaurant last night.  We asked if we could just sleep there so we could have breakfast too.  Seriously, this place has killer food!\n\nIt also has a relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff.  The three of us shared Duck Tacos, Fried Calamari and Lobster Bisque. All were outstanding.  The Calamari was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, served with Homemade Marinara Sause.  Yummy!  I also have to mention the bread cause its my favorite addiction.  Four kinds with whipped butter.\n\nMy entree was Garlic Shrimp & Grape Tomato over Angel Hair with snow peas and fresh basil.  The shrimp were sweet and buttery, the flavors blended perfectly.  My husband had Roasted Long Island Duck with Citrus Orange Sauce.  It was so good that he picked the last bits of  Daffy off the bones with his fingers.  My daughter had the Lemon Pepper Shrimp which she chose not to share with anyone cause, \""they are too good\"".\n\nBelieve it or not, we even had dessert. Fresh Mixed Berry Pie, topped with latice crust and whipped cream.  Bananas Foster, covered with buttery cinnamon sauce and ice cream.  Both were \""to die for\"".\n\nBottom line is, we can't wait to go back again and again.  Breakfast and lunch, here we come!!!"
0,"Tastes bad, food all seems processed, and my food was ordered and ready within 30 seconds - literally. At least hold onto my food for a few minutes to make me believe the food is fresh. Wouldn't recommend, this is my first time here and I won't ever be back."
0,"Do not go here! Place is way overcrowded, bathrooms were nasty. Tons of break ins in the parking lot. This place has outgrown it's size. Also if you cancel they will try to send you to collections. Again I can only stress, DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
1,8th street ale is my favorite!  Great food as well you can't go wrong
0,"My family and I tried to eat dinner at Genghis tonight and where very disappointed.  My husband is allergic to gluten and we checked them out online before going and they where suppose to be very accommodating.  When our server came to our table we made it clear of his food allergy, when we made the food we made it clear to the lady helping you load your bowl, and when we got to the grill we told the cook about his food allergy and even asked for it to be made with rice.  The cook was suppose to cook his food separate of all the other gluten dinners so as not to contaminate his but the cook just threw it on the grill with everything else.  We told our water and he said he would correct the problem but when his dinner came it was with noodles witch contain gluten and would have made him sick.  In the end my husband left hungry and I left mad.  The service was bad and the place felt like a fast food restaurant.  I love Mongolian grills but my food was disappointing and even without the food allergy mix up I would not wast my money and go back.  They did offer us a free desert but they looked bad and contained GLUTEN."
1,"Really good chicken fingers. I love chicken fingers and order them often, and these are some of the best I've had.  Definitely way above the sort of bar food or diner chicken finger quality.  These are light and crispy and very flavorful, especially the stuffed ones.  I recommend the Spinach Parmesan Stuffed Chicken!"
1,During my semi-regular visits to Vegas this is one of my favorite places to hit up for breakfast.\n\nI have heard  quite a bit of positive buzz about their pancakes but since I am mostly partial to omelettes for my first meal of the day I tend to stick mostly with their chorizo & eggs which is always served in large portions.\n\nDecently priced and with helpful service the only downside are some of the regulars who tend to be retirees who take forever to make their decisions which ocassionally means you have to wait for service to make their way to you.
1,"When it comes to Mexican food, this place is pretty solid and one of my go to places for lunch when I am at work. The food is great and prices are fair. My personal favorites include the chicken nachos and the Quesdilla's which don't seem to be on the menu for some reason. Or maybe I am just to blind to see it.\n\n**TIP** Call your order in ahead as everything is made to order as it should be. Be prepared to wait a bit if you order at the counter but it's never painfully long.\n\nMy only gripe about this place is they charge a $0.35 charge or so if you use a credit/debit card."
1,"Dark wood, dim lighting, and Old Fashioneds all around! We stopped in late on a Saturday to get our steak fix on and had a great meal here at Tornado Steak House. My husband and I split the GIANT 28 oz. on the bone Ribeye and let me tell you, this thing is huge. Loved the traditional iceberg wedge that came with the meal as well as the hash browns and giant onion ring on top of the steak, but the steak itself was honestly a little lacking. It just wasn't all that flavorful or tender which was a bit of a bummer. But...our friends that live in Madison swear by this ribeye...maybe it was just the fact that we came in later in the evening and they just wanted to get people out of there...who knows. The atmosphere was really cool and we still walked out completely stuffed so I can't be too upset. When we return to Madison I would definitely give Tornado another go."
1,"This is a solid 4 star hotel---maybe, even 5 for Vegas.\n\nI have to go to Vegas for conventions and am not that big of a fan. The Palazzo went for $119 on Hotwire which was a real bargain. Since it's part of the Venetian, you get the amenities, shopping, gambling and location which come with The Venetian, only a much nicer room.\n\nThey tried to up-sell me at the front desk which is annoying and typical of Vegas. \""Welcome to Las Vegas sir, can I please take all of your money?\"". That gets old after the 30th time. \n\nLas Vegas is really hurting due to the economy, so deals are out there and this is a great deal for $119!"
0,"I can't.  I've been here three times now and each pizza I had was not good.  This time around was such a disappointment, I had to yelp.  \n\nFirst off, the prices here are beyond ridiculous and I cannot justify the price because the pizzas are far from being tasty.  The menu is \""build your own\"" and comes in three sizes- 12, 16, and 18 inches, and priced based on that along wit the bread/sauce (few bucks more if you opt for pesto or white pizza, etc.).  Then you tack on an extra $2-$4 for each additional topping you want.  Now that's a bit excessive to me, but I'll fork out the cash if the food is worth it.\n\nI ordered a 16inch pizza topped with pesto, ricotta, anchovies, sun dried tomatoes, and jalape\u00f1o on 1/2 of the pizza.  The pizza came out sooooooo dry!  Barely any sauce, and the cheese they topped it off with (buffalo) was so hard and rubbery, it was inedible.  The anchovies had such an over powering taste of salt- had to pick them off.  I was expecting the ones soaked in vinegar, thinking it'd add a nice tangy taste.  The jalape\u00f1os were sliced so thick I had to pick those off too.  I love jalape\u00f1os on my pizza, but they've got to be sliced nice and thin in order for it to be good.  The waiter forgot to add the ricotta cheese so that was kinda lame.\n\nThe check came out to $30 for one pizza.  Such a waste of money.  Forced myself to eat it, but basically threw $4 worth of toppings out the window cause I picked them off my pizza.  Moreover, I had jalape\u00f1os put on 1/2 the pizza.  Why didn't I get charged 1/2 the price? Haha.  I'm open to ALL TYPES OF PIZZA: thin crust, thick crust, stuffed crust, deep dish, etc. etc., the pizza they serve here is thin crust, little sauce, extra dry, with sporadic pieces of rubbery cheese placed throughout.  The very basic foundation of a pizza does not meet my expectations here so I won't be back, there are other pizza places in LV I'd rather spend my money at."
1,"Started out our last full day in Las Vegas by stopping by this downtown dive bar . . . would have stopped the night before, but the parking lot was full of about 150 bicycles doing a dive bar riding tour.\n\nThis is a quaint little joint that brought back memories of younger years with cheap can beer and a great selection of liquors.  Since it was early in the day, there was no karaoke . . . but we will have to save that for our next visit.\n\nThe dollar bills added to the decor . . . and half the fun of our short stay was reading the names and locations.\n\nDefinitely on the TO BE REVISITED list on my next trip to Las Vegas."
1,"Just ate here last night, wonderful experience...let me tell you about it!\n\nI use OpenTable to make reservations, in order to build up points and get free stuff, but that's another story. The Dhaba is OpenTable friendly, so I made a reservation and we were sat immediately. We also found a Groupon, $18 for $30, so dinner was already $12 off before we walked in the door. \n\nIt was a Saturday night, around 7pm, and the place was practically full. My wife and I noticed that there were a lot of Indians eating here as well, which is always a good sign of authenticity! We couldn't help but notice the numerous placards and \""Best of...\"" awards hung all around the entryway. While this place was new to us, it certainly wasn't new to the area and has won many prestigious awards. \n\nThere was one hostess who also took orders while 3-4 other servers brought out food, refilled water, and pre-bussed the tables. We never needed a refill, never had dirty plates, and were always taken care of. This was a wonderful aspect of our dinner. My wife and I decided to try our favorite Indian staples: Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala (Heat index - 6), Tandoori Chicken, Saffron Biryani Rice, and Garlic Naan. \n\nThe food was wonderful. My wife enjoys a milder heat so we settled with a 6 on all our dishes (out of 10). The heat was calm with just enough *umph* for her. The flavors were delightful as I mixed them together. Tandoori Chicken in Tikka Masala sauce with garlic Naan bites. Yummerz! The presentation of the dishes looked beautiful and the servers were attending to our every need. We were very impressed with the customer service.\n\nIf you are in the Tempe neighborhood and looking for a wonderful Indian food restaurant, please check this place out. They are outstanding. My wife and I prefer this restaurant to the many other Indian restaurants within the area, and will definitely find our way here again!"
1,"Kim is the best and I am picky! I have been going here for over 4 years and whenever I go to her I am so happy with my pedicure. There are a few others at this nail salon that I have been pleased with the work but I usually see Kim because she is so consistent! I like that this place is clean, not over-priced compared to some (I get a hot stone massage!) and if I see her I know I will love the work. Thank you Kim!"
0,"I went there this afternoon for lunch and usually this place is fairly good and one of my favorites.\n\nBUT they had some serious electrical issues and the restaurant was closed for a few days.  Today when we went, 2 of us got food poisoning and got extremely sick.  literally bedridden w diarrhea etc.  \n\nThe fish/food etc. is NOT fresh so DO NOT EAT\n\nI called and the owner solution was for me to go to the hospital and bring them a doctors note to prove it which I will.  sort of an odd response to a customer being sick but just wanted everyone to be careful!!!!!"
1,"Six stars if I could!!  I just bought a new refrigerator and double oven for my house.  Wow this place is a real find!  I knew exactly what I wanted because I'd done quite a bit of research and I wanted to stay with a brand that matched my other appliances.  I worked with Brian.  He gave me a great deal, he actually beat the prices of the internet appliance store I had checked out.  (I didn't even ask him to do that.)  The appliances came in exactly when they were supposed to and they delivered them right when they said they would.  The install guy is also very pleasant, efficient and careful."
1,Nice place and friendly staff... I'm new to yelp but a long time regular here... They are always ready for me when I come in and most of them already know what I want.\nThe only downfall here is they tend to run out of my favorite drinks once every 6 weeks and it takes a week or two for them to restock it.
1,"This is the top of my list of buffets at LV. We did the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" for $39.99 and this was our 2nd buffet of the weekend. Out of all of the buffets we've been to (Paris, Planet Hollywood, & Caesars Palace) this is my favorite. Their wide variety of food suits every appetite I had. What I also liked about this buffet is that it's quite roomy, not cramped and crowded like my other buffets. Their crab is fresh and pre-cut so you don't have to struggle and crack anything. I am a little biased because I love tempura, and this is the only buffet (out of the 3) that actually had shrimp tempura.\n\nOverall the food is great, however I only gave them 4 stars because their refills for drinks can be a little more quicker. Otherwise this buffet is great!"
1,they have apple butter!! aaaahhhh
0,"Upon recommendation from an employee at Jiffy Lube, I took my car to Newby's Automotive and ATV Center in Henderson to fix an ongoing problem with my air conditioner.  Basically, the AC would start blowing warm air after a few days following a refill of the unit.\n\nThe manager indicated that my car had a bad compressor which needed replacement along with a new hose, freon and other services that would cost me $1500 (in addition to the nonrefundable $24.95 I had to pay for them just to look at the car.)\n\nI was immediately suspicious of the quote and took my car to Carmax instead who informed that only a new hose was necessary and charged me $50 to perform the repair.  The problem was solved with this relatively minor repair and no additional work has been necessary (this review is being written about ten months after the Carmax fix was performed and I have experienced no problems with the repair.)\n\nNewby's tried to charge me more than $1500 for a FALSE REPAIR that wasn't even necessary.  I wouldn't be the first person to deal with a dishonest mechanic but I know that I'm one of the few who bothers to warn others.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE."
1,"love this place, but please, turn down the music."
0,Way Over priced for small portion and terrible costumer service! Would never return. $70 lunch and they automatically add the tip which they don't mention for a server who stopped at your table twice and was to busy to refill your water glass! Thanks but no thanks
0,Breakfast is great here but dinner...well that's another story. We had one of the most revolting dinners. Even the salad tasted odd and not fresh. The food was bland and tasteless. The waitress was very nice and service was a bit slow.The only bright spot was my son enjoyed his broccoli cheese soup. Skip dinner and enjoy their breakfast instead.
1,Service was amazing and the treats were even better. We did a dessert and wine party at our home and asked sugar bees for a variety of treats. They exceeded our expectations with a beautiful ((and tasty)) variety. \n\nI am a brownie kind of girl ((they are delicious at sugar bees btw)) but try the cranberry almond bars ...ah--maazing!! We are hooked. Thanks again!!
1,"Excellent food, cool venue.  Had the Greek pasty, crust was baked perfect, fillings fresh and flavorful.  Side of cheese broccoli and cauliflower - again baked perfectly, perfect blend of cheese, breadcrumbs and sauce.  The Chocolate bread and butter pudding with anglaise was a phenomenal dessert to end with."
1,"We have driven by this place for years and have never stopped in...boy, were we missing out!  We picked out several items for a picnic and had a great feast - salami, bierwurst, swiss cheese, pretzel sticks, sparkling water and Haribo gummies.  The staff is so pleasant and helpful and the prices are very reasonable, but make sure you remember your cash...no credit cards accepted!\n\nI'll definitely be back for rouladen, potato dumplings, mustard, red cabbage and other tasty treats!"
0,Won't be back.   I used to use B&B for pens and dabbing products but the overpriced pen product they sold me broke twice in 2 months.   I paid $80 for the pen and choose to be loyal to them and buy other items like a dabbing rig as well.  The owner seemed chill when I bought the product and then when I came in to replace the product acted upset because he gets a lot of returns on that product specifically.   Here's a thought : if the product is cheap don't sell it.  And certainly don't get annoyed with your customers because of it.  If you choose a terrible product to sell and you know it's a cheap ineffective product and refuse to help me when I show you it's broke then I'm not going to spend another dime in your store.    If I have anything to say about it neither will any of my friends either.  I used to think highly of this store and it's ownership.  Unfortunately that opinion has drastically changed.  Sad.
0,"1.) Unorganized\n2.) Workers are rude and unprofessional\n3.) TOO crowded\n\nWhen I first arrived, the whole thing was totally unorganized! There were so many \""guest list tickets\"" given out which made the event overly crowded. The guy who checked my ID also didn't believe the photo was me and had to ask someone else. When the OTHER guy approved immediately, I turned around and saw he did it to several other girls as well... C'mon, are you trying to check them out or give them a hard time on purpose? POOR work ethic dude. Either that or he's just really bad at his job. \n\nAfter getting into the venue, I admit it's pretty big due to the different floors (one star to that), but you won't fully enjoy it if you can't even access to the dance floor because of how crowded it is. Unless you have bottle service, think twice about coming here!"
0,"Stayed here June 23-28. Not going to complain about the cheap price, but as everybody should know by now, \""you get what you pay for\"". And since this is downtown LV, not on the strip, don't expect much either.\n\nThe lobby and casino floor doesn't seem too bad, but not so much the elevators...to get to my room I would need to use the South Tower Elevator. It takes a REALLY long time...can't stress that enough. BUT I have been tipped off by an employee here that I could use their Service Elevator which is a bit quicker. But I've heard that to fix the elevators it would cost some million dollars... Then I entered my room...wasn't impressed especially because the chairs, blankets, table, even TV were very outdated. Don't know if its because they want to keep the feel of the old Vegas or they don't care to modernize just a little bit (at least the blankets).\n\nAnd Tinoco's Kitchen is decent...eat here if youre too lazy to go on the strip."
1,"Yummy food!\n\nThe workers are always nice and the food is awesome. It isn't all greasy like other mexican resturaunts, they give you chips and they have a salsa bar so you can keep getting more items. Great place! :)"
0,My girlfriends and paid to take a photo in the photo booth and the camera was turned to the wall. I asked 4 different people to help us or at least give us a refund and every person told me to ask someone else for help. After waiting over 20 mins we gave up. Extremely upset with the horrible customer services.
1,"I don't know why but I had really low expectations for this place the first time I ate here. I have been three times now and every time I am surprised by how great it is. They have awesome Al Pastor which you can get in a burrito, taco, tostada or quesadilla. You can actually see the meat roasting in the kitchen with a pineapple on top. Great salsas and friendly staff too."
1,"Sunburst landscaping was great.  After getting multiple quotes to have some artificial turf and pavers put in our back yard, my wife and I decided to go with Sunburst.  Their products were better quality and they were even lower cost.  Our project was delayed because of weather conditions but only by one day.  Jesse came out before they started to get an better idea of what we wanted and said it could take three days.  On Thursday March 6, 2013, Jesse and his crew showed up early, went over the plans again, and got right to work.  Demo and prep work was day one, and install was day two.  They were great and busted their butts to finish in two days.  The yard looks 100% better.  With a Rottweiler (130lbs) and a Bully Bordeaux (160lbs), their product is the way to go.  The dogs love it so much that they don't even go potty on it.  They will get off of it and use the rocks."
1,"I was really impressed by the menu options, the food quality and the service.  You order at the counter and either wait for Take-out or sit down and have them bring it to your table.\nThis place is good if you are looking for quality salads, wraps, sandwiches or smoothies.  Their baked goods look great as well.\nThis is located about a block off Fremont, in the Ogden building.  Clean, bright and away from the Fremont chaos and weirdness.  Expect about $8-$10 for sandwiches and $5 for a smoothie.  A nice smoothie bonus is that you may add protein for $1."
1,"I discovered shave ice back during my Kauai adventure.  I've always loved sno-cones, but so entranced was I by these delicious treats, I would actually stop what I was doing on my trip, drive across the island, and hit up Wishing Well as fast as I could.  Upon returning home, I checked into shave ice rehab, and knew the day would come when I would fall off the wagon.\n\nEnter South Point's Food Truck Fest.\n\nSnow Ono actually parked in front of our business during an event one day, but I was too busy to try them out.  This time, I was going for it.\n\nSo I waited in a crazy long line, but it gave me time to size up flavors, and all the little side additions that they would put upon it.  Upon getting to the window, the lady asked what I wanted, and she must have hexed me or something, because I was pretty much answering \""okay\"" to whatever suggestion she offered to enhance the shave ice experience.\n\nI waited a little more, and was served this beast of a treat that was three parts tasty, four parts delicious, and another three parts heaven.  So what if it was early February and I was freezing my butt off?  Man, that shave ice was awesome.  I saved a little for the missus, and then had to fight her off from eating the rest of it.\n\nI'm telling you now: When it hits those batmess hot 100+ degree temperatures this Summer, I am hunting these guys out.  I don't care if they end up making their way to Pahrump.  I'll still drive over there to find them.  If I can cover an island, I can make any drive.  Gollum has his ring obsession.  Mine lies in shave ice.\n\nActually, writing about it now makes me want one...."
0,Last two times my husband went here to get me frozen yogurt they were out of caramel. Horrible!!! We might have to find a new frozen yogurt place to go to.
1,"Took the light rail from downtown to Postino's on a Saturday--felt downright cosmopolitan!  Got there just before 4PM, earning me a few bucks off my first glass of wine.  The patio was just about full, and within an hour there was a waiting list for both inside and outside dining, so try to hit this place during off-hours.\n\nService was friendly, and the bruschetta was great--for those who haven't done the Postino's thing before, you pick four flavors out of twelve and get a bite of each for each member of your party.  The peppers and goat cheese, the fig and apple, and the prosciutto were outstanding.  Paninis and grilled cheeses floating by looked delish.  Wine was reasonably priced, and a lot more so from 11-4.\n\nYou can watch the poor valets scurry about in the sun while you lounge on the patio, reminding you that you're glad you walked or light railed in.  The place is open-air, even inside, and I'm interested to see how it works in the heat of summer.  We had a perfect springtime afternoon in the sun on their patio--just make sure one of your foursome brings sunglasses. :)"
0,"I've had better than this place. Yes it had unlimited sushi and other seafood, but the rest of the food was not bad but not good. I found that the only \""highlight\"" was the dessert selection. I really wouldn't go back unless someone else paid."
0,"Great for their sand volleyball leagues and a super fun referee, but double check the schedule as the games magically seem to shift without notice. \n\nThe food is not so great and neither is the beer on tap. I've felt the repercussions of their dirty tap lines way too many times the next day after one beer or two, so stick with canned and bottled beer. Their seasoned french fries are delicious if they're served fresh and their wings are ok."
1,"I love this place!  Amazing coffee, food and service. It is 5 minutes away from my job and is my favorite place to get lunch at, when I'm a hurry I use the drive-thru and is excellent service too. I usually order a hazelnut latte or  green tea latte, the alien burrito is to die for and I love the vegan carrot cake. \nYou definitely need to check this place out!!"
0,"I have lived here for almost five years now. At first it was great, all my neighbors were mostly military from nellis. My first year living here some Air Force guy hit my car then knocked on all the doors in our building to find me to pay for it. However after three years it started to decline a lot and I don't see that happening now with the people living here. Things just got ghetto and I'm glad that I'm a firm believer in carrying a firearm at all times. Plus the two airforce guys down stairs complain about our music in 5 in the afternoon. Really? I can under stand if it was like 9pm or later and if it was from our large speakers instead of our tiny Bluetooth speakers that we use with our phones. Lol. Okay, Let's get down to the pros and cons of the place. \n\nPRO:\n1. It's gated apartment complex which adds a little bit of security. \n2. The repair guys respond within 48hours or so. Not bad. \n3. Two pools with a bar area for parties and a nice spot to relax with a gas fire place. \n4. A small gym\n5. Gas grills located around the complex\n6. Looks nice from the outside. \n7. Has stands with doggie bags around the grassy areas\n8. close to smiths, Home Depot, dottys, jack in the box, in and out, costco isn't too far away, and a few parks not that far away as well. \n9. Dinner party's and ice cream parties hosted and paid for by the complex. \n\nCON:\n1. Neighbors are getting very ghetto and they don't look after their kids. They run around every where and I'm scared I might run a kid over one day. We had a baby shower at the pool and some random guy tried to get into a fight with us. Basically a lot of rude people live here now. \n2. The repair guys are lazy to do anything major in the repairs aspect and just mark it off telling you don't worry it's fine we'll make sure your not charged for it. The building is just settling. I now live with a giant crack across my wall that looks like it's going to come down. \n3. The main pool looks kind of gross because it hasn't been scrubbed clean in a long time. The second pool that my family and friends that come over has named the ghetto pool is disgusting. Trash is every where there, every time I walk my dog I see empty beer bottles and 40's lol\n4. The gym has most things but is very limited on their equipment. Wished it had better machines for core workouts. \n5. Every time I renew my lease the price gets higher and higher. \n6. No one picks up after their dog so their is dog **** every where even though you have doggie bag place around the place for free. \n7. Had a very rude encounter with one of the office managers. I've been using the same phone number to contact the office for five years every month to get a quote on my rent and water bill. one day it wasn't working. so I went into the office and ask if the number has changed and the manager said no. So I showed her the phone number, she was stubborn, and kept telling me no that's not our number then gave me a look that basically said your stupid. Few weeks latter I called using the same number I have been using and like magic it worked and I still use that same number to call the office when I need it. That was just very shady. \n\nMy recommendation is find some where else to live first. I know I am looking for some place a little nicer to live now. This place was just a really nice place to live in the beginning but has declined a lot. You do see a lot of eviction stickers on doors too lol."
0,"I wonder if anybody has decided to not go to vegas because of the reviews of McCarran Airport....\""3 star avg? hell no, I'm going to fly to Midway International Airport instead.\""\n\nIt smells in here. A lot of drunk people who are either:\n\na) at the end of a weekend bender\nb) just getting to vegas, took a ton of shots before boarding their plane, and got hit with drunkness on their flight over\n\nAlso, I hate the slot machines. The last thing I need while waiting for my delayed flight is to hear the bells, stupid music, and coins-falling-into-a-bin sound effect. \n\nIf you're lucky you can catch a glimpse of a celebrity as they are en route to their limo. I didnt see one but I did see Paris Hilton's limo driver. I was star struck and offered my body. The limo driver turned me down. Blast."
1,"After purchasing a new home closer to work, I knew I had to use Jeff's services again to re-key all the locks.  His service was fantastic 2 years ago, and is still just as outstanding today!  He arrived right on time (it was moving day and I must admit that I'd forgotten about our appointment that afternoon), and promptly went to work re-keying our locks.  He finished all the locks quickly, and the work was done at a VERY reasonable price!  I will certainly use A 1 Minute Key again and again!"

On the cell phone, with their friend, that is. -1.\n\nThe rooms were pretty small, but they got the job done. They were in the middle of remodeling, and I think we still had an unremodeled room. I say this because the beds were noticeably softer in another room that we had than the one I stayed in. -1\n\nThere was a sick stain on one of the box springs, it looked like blood. -1.\n\nPlenty of parking, close enough to campus, easy access from I-74."
1,"Best burger I've ever had and best burgers on the strip! I'm very picky with my burgers but these are perfection! Everyone in my party of 8 were very happy with their meal. I loved it so much that I almost went there a second time during my trip to Vegas. I recommend getting the truffle parmesan fries with your burger..so good! I would also recommend the hummus and Maui onion rings for appetizers. The hummus is super fresh and unique tasting and the onion rings are to die for! Don't plan on being seated right away and they do not take reservations. You put your name in and they text you when your table is ready. In the mean time, you could walk around the miracle mile shops which are right next door or gamble a bit. The food is definitely work the wait!"
0,"We tried it for breakfast since we were staying at the hotel and had a two-for-one coupon. If you're in that same situation, there are worse places you could go, but if you're contemplating paying full price, don't. \n\n\nIf you're in Vegas to enjoy gambling and shows, this might be a convenient option to fill up. If delicious food is on your \""must\"" list, keep looking."
0,The $6.49 linch lured is in...The chicken in the sweet and sour chicken was bad. As in not good for human consumption at this point. The coconut chicken although cheaper than the usual coconut shrimp was yummy. Fried rice was good. Egg rolls were beyond horrible & no duck sauce. Service was poor since we never got a refill until after we got our check and still had to ask for it. Nothing remarkable beyond the price.
1,"I met my buddy there for our once-a-year-get-amazing-food-dinner we like to do. When I flew out I saw a write up on the place in SkyMall magazine. Figured I'd need to try it. \n\nThe restaurant is gorgeous with huge vaulted ceilings, lots of dark wood and stone and a great open bar. It was very dim and there was a mix of couples, friends, and businessmen throughout. Not a particular vibe since this was in the Cosmo in Vegas. \n\nService was top-notch. Nothing to remark on there. The food was outstanding save for one dish. Neither I nor my friend particularly liked the macaroni and cheese. Nothing was 'wrong' with it, we simply didn't care for the flavor. So in exceptional service and expected standards, they took back the item and did not charge us for the meal. \n\nThis is on the steeper end of the price range and I can certainly eat better steak here in Montana but the wine was well-priced and there was overall, nothing to complain about. I definitely enjoyed my experience. \n\nYou shouldn't be disappointed and if you are, they'll remedy real quick."
0,"for starters the place is the same as before ,it's still to bright, food fare,beer selection fare,bad decor\n\nsame place different sign\n\nwe felt the food was the same as eating at Eat-n-Park\nfish was over cooked, & just a plain ,bland chicken salad but the tomatoes were fresh\n\n\nIn this  case a change in the name didn't change restaurant"

0,"DO NOT waste your time with this place.\n$19 \""appetizer sampler\"" was a total waste of money! Soggy nachos, re-fried taquitos,  and a condescending manager named Sandy who did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. She did offer us a $10 gift certificate to patronize this business in the future and blamed the quality of food on their third party delivery service Road Runner. \n\nI give this place a negative 5 stars. \nKeep your gift certificate Sandy, we will not be back in the future\n\nF"
1,This place has some of the best BBQ I ever had in my life and the stuff is super friendly and funny
0,"Stopped in for a slice of pizza - the sign in the window indicates you can get pizza by the slice.\n\nAnother restaurant in Pittsburgh that does not understand the concept of Air Conditioning. It was so hot and humid in here I was glad that all I ordered was one slice. The faster I could inhale it - the faster I was out of there.\n\nI asked what the options were for slices - I was told \""cheese or  pepperoni.\"" So I ordered one slice of pepperoni and got a bottle of cold water to go with it.\n\nThe pizza was okay - could have been more pepperoni for my blood, and the pepperoni was the very small diameter stuff."
1,I was in town on business and saw this place. Read the mixed reviews....but it was great!  Awesome food and everyone was so nice!  GREAT PLACE!
0,"In my experience I found her not to have the level of knowledge and expertise expected.  Suspect either poor listening or poor comprehension skills as she researches and answers questions not asked, while failing to respond to those actually asked then charges both meeting time and research time.\n\nInitially found her to be basically competent in elementary tax matters (ie turbo tax or other software might do just as well) but would suggest seeking expertise elsewhere if your situation has any degree of complexity or variance to vanilla 1040."
0,"In terms of Italian cuisine, there are plenty of choices to turn to in the Montreal and Laval area. And with the surplus of Italian restaurants in both cities, if you're not the best, you're somewhere lost in the middle.\n\nBased on my meal, I'd say Lugano's falls in the middle. I ordered the rotollo pasta (which is, in essence, a roll of pasta with ricotta cheese between layers and then smothered with mozzarella). Firstly, we received our meal within 10 minutes of ordering it. Maybe even less. That kinda turned me off, as I would have preferred to wait longer to keep up with the illusion that our meal was made fresh and not just freshly served. I get that restaurants do a fair amount of prep before service, but the place was really full; even if it was prepared earlier, the pastas texture was off. The pasta was soft, the stuffing was bland, and the sauce had little flavour. To put concisely, it lacked depth. Not even the oozing mozzarella topping saved it. On the plus side, super warm baguette served before your meal is a win no matter how good or bad the food is, so that was appreciated. \n\nWe were in an out of there in less than half an hour. Service was incredibly efficient! My meal could've used a little more TLC though."
1,"Stayed here again because of the convenience to the light rail. My husband and I along with 2 friends had tickets to the George Strait concert and wanted to not have to fight traffic so we chose the Radisson. Check in was a breeze and the front desk clerk upgraded our rooms to Cabana suites...free of charge. Once again the room was extremely clean and had been recently updated. Brian down in the bar was great for happy hour..and he has a heavy pour. Check out the happy hour specials, they have a list of specialty martinis for $5. We love this location, sure it's off the beaten path and across the street from an adult bookstore but everyone is always friendly and pleasant and the property is taken care of and the best part it's 2 blocks from a light rail station. Catch it and enjoy a concert or sporting event downtown without the hassle or cost of parking."
1,"If you are someone who is afraid of partying around a younger crowd then this is not the place for you. This was my second time going (this time with my husband, sister, and other family), none of whom are under the age of 30 and we had a blast. Are the drinks overpriced? Yes, it's Vegas. Are some of the bouncers douchy, um yeah...it's Vegas. Will you see people drinking and puking...YEAH, IT'S VEGAS! It's FUN. So have a laugh at others expense and enjoy yourself. Do forget to laugh at yourself as well. :0)"
1,"We have been going to Sardine since it opened several years ago.  It started out at a high level of consistency and innovation.  And now it still gets a little better every year.\n\nThe oyster happy hour, T-F, 4-6pm, is popular.  They offer east coast high end oysters for $1.25 each.  Plus there is a discounted tap and house wine.\n\nIn the summer, we love the fried smelt and housemade tartar sauce.  It's plenty for two people.  That and one of their great mojitos and you are feeling summer by Lake Monona.\n\nThe roast chicken is a steady desire for many in my family.  It is covered in an aromatic herb blend and rich brown sauce.  Of course the small side of accompanying frites rounds out this comfortable treat.\n\nTheir roasted meats are outstanding.  On our last visit we had the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly.  They came with this light and creamy potato cheese croquette.\n\nSardine has a great pastry chef if you get that far.\n\nYou'll love the decor.  If you're lucky, in the summer, eat on the patio.  Yes, it overlooks the parking lot, but ignore that and enjoy the lake just beyond. \n\nThe food and service at Sardine are always among the best in town."
1,"Toujours un bon choix pour le lunch, m\u00eame pour le soir ou le 5@7.\n\nLa bavette de veau est vraiment tr\u00e8s bonne. Le service super attentionn\u00e9, l'ambiance assez dynamique, peut-\u00eatre un peu bruyant, mais l'exp\u00e9rience est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et positive. Choix de vin correct peut-\u00eatre un peu limit\u00e9 au verre, mais raisonnable.\n\nJ'aime beaucoup cet endroit."
1,"Not from the area. We found this place from Yelp. When we were in parking lot we were kinna wondering if this was really Vietnamese restaurant. Looks like hole in the wall. Food was amazing. Big portion and the servuce was very good. Next time I visit, for sure I'll be here again.   Bun Bo Hue I ordered was good but it tasted a little to much MSG. Still was good tho."
0,"Food is pretty good...service not so much. I can understand service being \""off\"" when it's busy but NOT when there's nobody in the joint but you and one other guy waiting on his order.  Smile, ladies...You're employed..."
0,"Tried lots of cupcake/fancy cake stores around the valley- and this doesn't even come close. They are charging \""Caketini\"" and \""Sprinkles\"" prices for cupcakes that taste better at Fry's or Safeway. Yuck. My daughter wouldn't even finish hers- and she LOVES cupcakes. Normal size cakes- not worth the money. Dry and overcooked. ick. We all walked out thinking they won't last more than 6 months. Small storefront- but very clean. Owners were friendly. We will not return."
0,"Stayed here during my first time in Vegas. Got a pretty good deal online. The room we got was part of the newly renovated section of the hotel. It was in Tower 2 facing New York New York and had a gorgeous view of the strip. It was spacious including the bathroom (no tub) and there was easy access to the elevator and the side of the parking lot where we parked. Going in and out was no problem. I just didn't like the overall ambience. It was very dark and gloomy (my pet peeves) and you immediately smell carpet cleaning solution as soon as you walk in. Plus, there are people by the entrance selling time-shares and they are targeting couples. Don't be fooled! My boyfriend and I were very annoyed by them. We learned not to walk in holding hands. The whole medieval theme seems to be half-a**ed. Now that I am more familiar with Vegas, I think I will try another hotel next time..."
0,"Went to ask a question about my new IPhone.  There was a customer ahead of me so i was asked to wait.  No problem...\nThen while waiting on me, another customer comes in the door. He however is asked what is the problem and the clerk starts to help him while I'm sitting there.  Clerk now says he can wait on two people at once.  Now I have half his attention at best, because he is reaching to make a phone call for the other guy.\nNo respect!  Maybe it's a senior citizen thing.  I no longer recommend this place.  I walked out of the store, I haven't done that in a LONG time."
1,I not to fond of sushi and I'm rating this 5 stars. I usually avoid the roll and go for the nigiri like Super White Tuna and Cajun Tuna which are my top 2 favorites and they just melt instead of being all plasticky and chewy. Also did I say that Sushi is one of my least favorite food and I'm giving this 5 stars?\n\nThis review is base on the food alone not the service. If the old Asian lady isn't serving you most likely you going to get okay service or less.
1,"I found a new dentist! Dr. McAdams and staff are amazing! My new patient visit was so pleasant, I decided to come back a week later for a filling replacement. The procedure was virtually pain-free for me. You know how sometimes you get that buzzed lip and sore gum after the pain killing shot? Well, not with Dr. McAdams. Sometimes I'm a big baby and need two shots before drilling but I didn't feel a thing throughout the whole filling replacement. Dr. McAdams has fantastic dental skills and explains what's happening in simple terms. He's funny and very personable. The entire staff is friendly with excellent customer service from reception to billing and the dental assistants. McAdams Dental is a fantastic place to get the best care for your teeth. I really like the ultra modern xray machine that doesn't require those hard cardboard bite wing things. My cleaning was done using an ultrasonic tool instead of the old fashioned scraping and chiseling method at other dentists. Great job McAdams Dental!"
1,"Chefs stick their hands into everything, wipe them on dirty towels, and plunge them into everything again. \nBloody injuries are common. \nThe Orpheum is one of these places.\n\nWord of mouth says:  try the mussels.\nA lot of restaurants leave mussels in buckets soaking in their own putrid piss and pus. One bad mussel in a heaping pile can ruin it all, like that one dusty bad pistachio that dissolves nauseatingly in your mouth like anthrax. \n\nThe Orpheum's mussels are pretty good. \n\nBut what I go for is the fried chicken. Seriously.\nServed with honeycomb and mashed potatoes, half a chicken, rolled in a secret mix of breadcrumbs and spices, (black pepper, mostly) it is a moist, succulent, truly satisfying bit of gourmet comfort food. \n\nThe blue gill fish fry on Wednesday and Friday is good, too. I don't like fishy fish, and blue gill is subtle, a bit more interesting than cod, but not as gamey as perch, and certainly not as in your face as Asian carp.\nSmall chunks beer-battered and deep-fried swim upstream to your table to spawn with your mouth. Good stuff.\n\nI also recommend their Tomato Bisque, a thick bit of hot fun, although it really needs a bit more zest. That's why I carry my own jar of secret seasoning with me at all times.\n\nI have my own preferences: mashed potatoes need garlic; tomato bisque cries out for some pepper; all food loves a bit of lemon. But The Orpheum does a very good job without offending bland Midwestern tastes.\n\nThe Orpheum bar has suffering a reputation for snobby inept bartenders who talk more to their friends than pour drinks; rows of waiting customers, most of whom are loud obnoxious Long Island girls \n(guess what they order......);  and overpriced selection of bad beer.\nBut they seem to have pulled themselves up out of that mire.\n\nThe only problem remaining is the tiny kitchen. \nIt suffers from the same affliction that the tiny bar does: \nboth are too small to serve the amount of customers they receive. \nThe kitchen is a midget submarine-sized space clearly designed for something other than cooking gourmet meals on a busy weekend. \nThe sheer fact that they do pump out some excellent food is an admirable miracle.\n\nMy advice: arrive early. \nEat.  Drink.  And then see a movie."
0,"Really disappointing food. The service was slow but polite. \n\nIt seemed very inefficient to have four different servers attending to the same small area - but even worse was that only the one assigned to us would actually acknowledge us, so we ended up waiting for every little thing. \n\nFor the food, my companion had chicken parm, which was ok but not flavorful at all. It didn't even come with pasta. I had a Greek salad that was barely edible - overcooked, dry chicken, wilting lettuce, and huge chunks of unripe tomato and cucumber and onion. All the veggies were in enormous pieces that had to be cut several times to fit inside a mouth. The 'Italian' dressing was just a plastic cup of oil with some giardiniera in it. \n\nWe only drank water, but the meal still cost $35. Ridiculous for a basic chicken dish and an old salad. Will not go back."
0,"The pizza was as bad as the service. They did not greet me when I came in, forgot half of my order (unapologetically) and didn't so much as thank me.\n\nThe pizza had sweet sauce, soggy sweet crust and was about as close to authentic New York pizza as dominos. I moved to Las Vegas from New York. If you want authentic New York pizza and good service, check out Rocco's."
0,"Let me preface by saying: \n\nDO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES STAY AT THIS DISASTER OF A HOTEL!!!\n\nMy friends and I booked here only because other friends that we were to be meeting wanted to stay here. I was irritated because of it's location off of the strip, but I didn't want to rock the boat, so I acquiesced. Turns out I should have put up the biggest fuss of my life. \n\nWhen we arrived at our room in the casino tower, the card reader at the door was faulty and did not work for the 1st, 2nd or 3rd key. Finally, the fourth key worked. When I entered the room, I saw disheveled sheets, tissues on the bed like somebody had just had a \""session\"" a wet washcloth on the alarm clock CRAWLING WITH ANTS, ANTS ON THE ROOM PHONE  and a HORRENDOUSLY foul order flowed out of the room as well. I called front desk and they moved us to the HRH tower. Definitely nicer but guess what... the SHOWER HAD SLIME ALL OVER THE BOTTOM!!! I wore shower shoes for the rest of the weekend after that. The floor was not vacuumed and so I had room flops as well. Just wholly uncomfortable and dirty. \n\nHonestly, there are so many annoying things to tell, so I will save you the rest of the bloody story and just tell you about the cons.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Rehab will charge you an additional $3 per drink because of some nonsencical LET tax that they don't tell you about ahead of time\n\n- They gave us a $50 food credit for the inconvenience, then charged my card for it\n\n- Did I mention the DIRT??\n\n- OUT OF THE WAY!! You will spend $80 additional on taxis \n\nI don't even want to go on. Just save yourself a headache and don't do it!! You've been warned!!"
1,"LOVE GR! so, since we couldnt afford his steakhouse, we opted for lunch at Burgr.\n \nThe real flames on the sign were pretty cool. Fiiiiiiiiire! then there was a line forming with a sign that said \""do not wait here until you check in with the hostess\"".  so, we left line to do just that.  after waiting to speak to the hostess, she said \""oh yeah you just wait in the line\"".  ok..... Now we lost our place in line! annoying!\nthe wait wasnt too bad tho (theyre lucky).  we were seated.  all the waiters and waitresses were good looking.  funny, he only wants good looking ppl working for him.  eh, dont blame him but i didnt think the women's uniform was very nice.  they were one piece tight ass short ass dresses.  all the men waiters wore his personal line of jeans with a gold \""GR\"" on the back pockets.\n\nOur waiter comes.  very friendly.  everyone smiled, ask how your day was going, etc.\nthen a young man approaches us because he sees my husband's Sabres hat.  He asked if we were from Buffalo.  We said yes, chatted a little, he asked what we were in Vegas for and we told him for our 20th anniversary.  he congratulated us and told us he was one of the managers there. I thought he was just a guest!\nthen 1 minute later our waiter comes with 2 glasses of champagne! very nice touch GR!\n\nfood did take a bit to come out but it was very good! overall very nice place.  Glad to have had at least something from one of Chef Ramsey's places!"
0,"NOT WORTH IT!!!  I was very disappointed with the quality & service.  I had initially requested to have my order delivered, was given a total which did not match up, so  I called them back to say that I'd just pick up my large order instead & was given a $5+ price difference.  I asked them what their delivery fee was, they said $3.00. Hmmm!...Clue #1.  When I picked up the order, I was given another totally different price.  I went ahead & paid for it anyways, but still felt they'd cheated me.  My container had more steamed Brocolli than there was Walnut Shrimp.  That plate was $10.95.  My husband began to eat his dish (Moo Goo Gai Pan) and he said how it tasted like it was cooked with chemicals.  I tried a spoonful and confirmed it.  He ended up puking his guts out about an hour later.  I called to speak to the Manager & they acted like they didn't care about our experience.  I told him that I wasn't expecting a refund but just needed them to hear my concern.  They still didn't care.  It's no wonder why people prefer to go to Buffets."
0,"So far, I don't like it here! We just checked in and so far the customer service has been horrible....okay we decided to self park and it is crazy the distance you need to walk to get to the reception area, where there was a crazy line and only five people checking in customers. We finally got to the counter and let them know that unfortunately we we unable to stay our second night...reply..you will need to call Expedia. here Here is the thing, my husband called the hotel and was transferred to reservations and got  Expedia! Okay so we then get our keys and info and honestly she didn't tell us one thing about the hotel and barely gave us info about where the  room is...then we find the room, and it's on the housekeeping floor...never get put in rm 2248p,,,,you look at @ nothing...oh then we get our Barry Mannilow tickets (yes a fan) and the guy tells us nothing...not when to be there...where to go! Nada! So I just got here and we are still on the phone trying to not stay here another night! I will never stay here again!  Oh and there is nothing in the mini-bar and there is this out-dated tubed television on the right side of the room and the bed is in the middle,,,,,really? Never again! I hope Barry is worth the hassle...oh and when we called Expedia, they called Paris who stated they would still charge us for the room night! What a disaster!"
0,"I gave it 2 stars because my massage was good but would have normally given it 1 star.  The facility and amenities were extremely disappointing.  They've updated the casino but did not touch the spa.  The lounge was small with old, uncomfortable seating.  The tiles in the shower were chipping; the door handle to the sauna had duct tape to hold it together; the apples were rotten.  I chose this place because they accept Spafinder certificates but if I use the certificates again, I would rather go to the Paris spa."

If your name has the main dish in it you better stand out from everyone else including Mc Donald's pushing the same thing, especially if you're gonna overcharge. \nNot consistent enough for me to go back a fourth time.\nSorry guys find some other sucker to pay your rent.\nIf my fellow yelpers must go here to get ur poutin fix keep it simple, and whatever you do stay away from the braised beef!!!\nI don't know what that animal was, but it wasn't no cow!"
1,I am a big fan - and a regular. Bar side service is great and prices are very reasonable .
1,"The atmosphere is good,  lots of tables for everyone.  Love the lighter choices menu with calories posted.  I opened for the Veggie burger,  it's served in whole wheat bread and a side garden salad with balsamic.  It was great and there was no dairy in this burger also! \n\nMy hubby opted for the eggs, hash Browns,  two peices of toast.  The hash Browns here nice because they were not greasy.  \n\nI also had to have one of their fresh juices,  it had kale,  celery,  beet etc and was a great. Size at the large.  This is a must order. \n\nThus is a great place to go for a healthy fast food option.  Price is slightly higher then your tradition fast food but definitely worth the calories and eating organic.  \n\nIf you are into gluten free they also have great pasta options for you."
0,"I was really looking forward to this place, but seriously this place is so over-rated.  The wait for 2 was going to be 20-30 minutes.  My husband and I decided not to wait, but to go to the take out window instead.  The menu on at the take out window is condensed, but it still has the frozen hot chocolate.  We ordered the smallest size of the frozen hot chocolate for $8.50 - that's eight dollars and fifty cents!!! Serious? But I thought eh I'm in Vegas and maybe it is that good. NOT! It was way too sweet.  I couldn't even finish half of the drink.  I am so glad we did not wait for the sit-down. Would've been a waste of time. Oh well. Maybe the one in NYC is better."
1,"The heart of Wildflower is its bakery, and it seems like the restaurant sprung from that. Their menu is wide-reaching, with anything from scones to fritattas, roast beef sandwiches to smoked salmon alfredo. \n\nI have been partial to the pasta, but have heard solid reviews of the breakfasts and sanwiches, as well. It is essentially comfort food at its most basic level, and they don't do much to rock the boat beyond that. \n\nIt is at the same time my critique and my endorsement of Wildflower that they stay so true to comfort food recipes. Part of me would like to see something a little more adventurous and innovative, but further consideration makes me concede that my favorite aspect here is that you know what to expect when you order. The food is fresh and fast and the service is good, without much deviation from their traditional ingredients."
0,"Cafe Rio is on a downhill.\n\nWhen I tried in the past I thought it was decent, but this time, lettuce, rice and all other ingredients were very dry. So disappointing. I don't know how they could overlook it.\n\nGo to Chipotle."

1,"The food here may not be the best or most authentic in the Valley but it is pretty good and fresh and, once you factor in the great prices, an excellent value!  The chips and salsa were fresh and tasted great.  I ordered the Steak Picado and it was really good!  The inside might have been a little run down, but the atmosphere was bright and cheery and the staff, though hurried, were very friendly.  The food came out hot and quick.  I definitely plan on going here again!"
0,"I judge Asian bakeries on their Pineapple Bun. And Diamond Bakery doesn't add up to buns I've had in LA (unfair comparison, I know) or even to buns you can find at 168 Market. I tried a while host of other buns and pastries, but The only thing I've had here that I enjoyed are the Steamed Pork Bun. Get them while they're hot, though."
1,"Came to buy some flowers and organic fruits.\n\nI picked up Kale that was on sale, Strawberries and red grapes that were deliviously naturally sweetened!\n\nUnfortunately, I had an incident with the flowers when I got into my car, but the staff were very kind to give me a refund since it was a time sensitive issue.\n\nExpect great customer service and knowledgeable staff at this Town Square location \n\nThe cafe is fantastic as well.\n\nDefinitely quality over quantity !"
0,Zero stars.  Zero.  Not veteran friendly at all.  Waited in line 40 mins.  Proof of my dd 214 and final discharge paper.  I would have tipped more than the buffet as I always do.  Turned away with my family.  They lost my loyalty as a summerlin resident.  Then they look at me as if I am begging for a free meal.  Please.   I brought my family with me.  Very disappointed.   Going to south point.  A real veteran friendly establishment.
0,Absolutely an atrocious experience. I was returning 2 floor mats. The wait there was over 30 minutes. There was only one station open. The rep was arguing with the customer for over 15 minutes. Just one customer! 15 minutes. The rep tried to call the supervisor. It took another 10 for the supervisor to come. No one would open another station to help out. Absolutely ridiculous.
1,"We celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary one evening and the experience was unforgettable.  My wife enjoys a good steak and so, I thought of Fleming s. I've been to Ruth Chris', but heard so much about Fleming s that I decided to give them a try.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, we were treated like regulars. We sat at a booth which was nice and comfy. Our server was Nick who was very friendly, pleasant and  was very knowledgeable, but he cleared more utensils that he needed to and forgot to bring the two knives that were removed.  We weren't rushed and had enough time to decide on our meal. My wife started with a glass of Pinot Noir and since I'm allergic to alcohol, I had water.\n\nThe appetizer, Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes was not jumbo, but the crab and sauce flavors were. The salad, Lettuce Wedge, you were given a slice of bacon and blue cheese which you had to crumble yourself and my wife's Modern Caesar Salad was excellent. Main course, Newport Filet and Main Filet with a side of sauteed mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the button mushrooms are the ones I like instead of the sliced ones.\n\nWe followed the evening meal with the Turtle Pie and coffee which capped off a wonderful anniversary dinner. By the time we finished our first cup, Nick was right there filling our coffee cups again.\n\nThe manager came to our table several times to check on us, was friendly and gave us an incentive to come back which we will definitely use. We only saw our server once during our meal. The bus boy was terrific, he brought our missing pair of knives and kept our water glasses filled and cleared our table for us. Everyone there was so friendly and was not your typical stuffy high-end restaurant atmosphere."
1,"I went to Monsoon Siam with the Madison Review Crew meetup group with the intention of writing a review.  Then, a day before, a member of the group writes that he can't come,  but is looking forward to hearing if it is indeed of authentic Thai quality,  since he is Thai,  and he cooks traditional foods here at home.\n\nSo.  Is Monsoon Siam authentic Thai?  Is it Thai traditional, fresh, authentic, vivid?\n\nI have no idea!   It could be authentic Serbo-Croatian for all I know - - I have never been to Thailand - - but whatever it is, they should not change ANYTHING,  because this is splendid cuisine.  The presentation - - just the very looks of the meal?   You will be tempted to let it sit getting cold on the plate for 45 minutes,  staring at it,  just because it LOOKS so gorgeous.   If you were really small, or got down really low to the table, and looked at them, it would be like going to Disneyland for the first time - - it would be that colorful and fantastical.\n\nAnd same with the flavors.   The three dishes we got - - one was big, broad, flat, floppy noodles that were sublime delicious (with just a touch of sweetness);  another was crispy squid done up luscious with smatterings of fresh herbs and veggie touches, and you just wish that the dish was big as a house, instead of just a regular portion, because you could eat it nonstop for a month;  the last was minced chicken with spices in a thin flaky-formed shell that was super hot but unlike anything else anywhere.   All three dishes were electrifyingly interesting, pretty, and delicious. \n\nAnd did I mention the cigar roll appetizer?  No, I did not yet mention the cigar roll appetizer.  It was like egg rolls, but actually FUN.  The texture was the thing - - it made life more interesting and alive, just sharing one of the three cigar rolls in this appetizer.  When was the last time you could say that about an egg roll?\n\nService was great, because these were (also) real people, enjoying themselves, and being themselves, and loving what they were doing.\n\n(BTW:  the company was great too!)"

0,"Came here while in town visiting a relative and wanting to get some sushi together.  This place was a huge disappointment.  The place was overpriced and left me with a not so fresh feeling.  I dont recall everything that I had, but when you spend money on sushi, which I have no problem doing, you expect to get what you paid for.  At this place I felt I would have been better off going to a local grocery store and getting some of their crap sushi, because at least then I would have wasted less money."
0,"Hmmm...Im not sure what all the rave reviews are about...\nMy husband & I went to Vegas after he returned from a 9 month deployment.  Before our trip, I went online and searched for all the must-do & bargain deals that Vegas offered.  Luv-It Frozen Custard was recommended.  I'd have to say that even before our trip began, I was more looking forward to going to this place than going anywhere else because I LOVE frozen treats.  We couldn't go during the first two days but on the third, when my husband found out that there was a Star Trek convention at the Hilton Hotel, I waved goodbye to him and eagerly made my way to this place.  In my mind, I was going to get Cold Stones portion of the most savory custard and I wasn't going to have to share any of it with my husband...\nWell, when I rounded the corner to this place, I knew I might be in for a let down...just the ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood.  I actually missed the store and had to turn around.  \nWhen I finally got to the parking area, I was surprised because I thought it was a shop that I would be able to walk in to, see the various custards, and pick the one that I wanted.  Instead, I was faced with just a guy hanging his head out the window, asking me what I would like.  \nI ended up getting chocolate chip.  I was unimpressed.  I thought it would come in a cone but he gave me a scoop of it in a styrofoam cup.   The portions were so tiny!  The size...not what I imagined.  The taste...also not what I imagined.  It was like eating soft ice cream.  The price...EQUALLY unimpressive.  How can you call a scoop of ice cream for about $5(?) cheap?  \nI tell you, this place IS NOT a hidden gem.  It may be hidden but it's no gem.  You'll be better off getting your frozen treat from somewhere else like Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio.  You're spending about the same amount of money for more gelato, and you'll get to enjoy it at the Bellagio!  (((I love Bellagio...)))\nAfter the convention, my husband asked me if I wanted to go to Luv-It's now, not knowing that I went without him...I said NO! \nI'm telling you, save your money!  It's just not worth it!"
0,Veggie burgers suck. Decided to try something new today... I totally regret that decision.  We got two different ones and they are horrible not to mention they took 20 minutes to get out and there were only two other tables there.  I won't be visiting there again... EVER

I just wish they were more gluten-free friendly - everything is fried or sauced or battered.\n\nMy favorites - pork chile verde enchiladas topped with a fried egg, ceviche served with a side of the sweetest grilled corn, oh! and did i mention the mojitos?!\n\nThe patio is GORGEOUS, great ambiance and great for groups. The inside is a bit dark for my tastes. It gets so quiet and dark in the dining room away from the bar - great if you want that romantic date setting."
0,food is great...but service wise is horrible. We walked in and waited for a while before some one came out to greet us. we were trying to understand the menu since it is our first time here. the server seem like she was angry at us for asking so much. then later we realized it was actually  lunch time and I think we interrupted it. overall the food was good will have to give them that.
0,"My hubby and I recently moved from OR to AZ and have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the area, so we wanted to try Los Olivos. We had dinner at Los Olivos this evening and were very dissappointed of the food quality and taste!! We had sopes as an appetizer and as a main entry, my hubby had camarones al mojo de ajo (shrimps in garlic) and I had Flautas Ana. We didn't like any of these dishes we tried. :( Too greasy and no good taste! We are not coming back at all!\n\nService was okay."
0,"The hotel feels old in general. It has this heavy perfume which we didn't care about, but can probably get annoying.\nNo WIFI, no coffee machine in the room. Not a big deal unless you're traveling with a baby and you're forced to spend $2.50 at Starbucks each time you need a cup of warm milk.\n\nWe didn't purchase early check-in, so we left our luggage at the bell desk. When we came back, we had to wait 15 min for the guy to get our bags out of the room, because he was eating a sandwich. He later explicitly complained about us not tipping him.\n\nThe TV reset its volume every night, and lowering it with the remote just made it jump to max, then go down very slowly. Also it was difficult to find real TV channels among all the hotel's self-advertising crap (which includes messages on the room phone)\nThe beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Nothing special, although the slanted windows and the Egyptian themed furniture were cool.\n\nSecurity was extremely annoying about having the baby in the casino. We never had the baby near us while playing, and still we got warned.\n\nThe restaurants at the Luxor have pretty low ratings on Yelp, so we only tried Backstage Deli, which was quite disappointing.\n\nThe monorail seems like it was made to confuse people. It only stops at the Luxor when going north, which means it's faster to walk from the Excalibur and to the Mandalay.\n\nGood value for the price, but I don't think I'm booking this hotel again."
1,"Prix fixe lunch with Mediterranean bass, smoked salmon bagel and a dessert of Greek Yogurt.\n\nThe temperature contrast and ingredient freshness of the bagel sandwich was superb, and I daresay the Yogurt was the best yogurt I've ever had, though the creaminess no doubt comes with a caloric curse.\n\nThe bass was succulent and flavourful, but not exceptional.  \n\nPerhaps most amazing was the decor - a melange of Mediterranean themes with sunbleached tones for the irregular brick-work, and many bits of shoreline art results in a very resortlike, beach-side feel for a decidedly inland city."
0,"Greyhound is the black hole of happiness. There was a girl at the package express desk who after realizing there was only one person that could help with luggage, helped me get my boxes to my car. She da KING! And the only reason they get two stars. But Greyhounds nationally need to find a way to take pride in themselves again. Let's beg for some government assistance here? 2 people at the desks to help a quadrillion tired, angry guests? And, of course, the ticket machines weren't working. And since the girl was helping me with my stuff that leaves OOOOOONNNEEEEE guy to face a packed house of very angry and weary travelers? It's inhumane. And STIFLING HOT!! Set up a couple of desk top fans, damn! The vending machines were stocked, so that's cool. I hope the machines took dollars because there weren't any change machines, as another disgruntled patron (well, not \""patron\"" so much as an \""only slightly bathed individual who wanted $5 in quarters\"" noted.) Where I had sent my packages from was also an awful, dryer place where sunshine never touched. (Literally! Because I was in the pacific northwest, HAH!!) However, if you you're moving on a budget, it's the cheapest you're going to find. HOWEVER!!! The site said that you had to not have the boxes secure so they can check them if you need, but not to worry because they have tape if you need it. THAT'S A LIE!! I had to go on a quest for duct tape. (I was shipping plastic bins)."
1,"The other reviews for this place are really spot on. Cash only. No seating. Take out only. Be prepared with what you want (kind of feels like the soup nazi a little bit, and I am slow to make decisions - panic mode!). But it's pretty darn good.\n\nThe chicken is fresh and crispy. I had the 1/4 chicken dark meat meal. Really good chicken. They don't do fake/over processed  chicken, no boneless anything. And when we asked the lady at the register if they did chicken strips, she smiled and said, \""no, baby, this is real thing only.\""  Perfect response.  I'll definitely come back here, with a little blanket to sit on the grass."
1,"I love Hob Nobs! I've been downtown for about a year now and go there often, there sandwiches and salads are delicious...  I love vito's favorite, mmmm!\nThey have life music, art from local artists for sale...\nEveryone there is always very friendly, free wi-fi, a nice cozy setting.\nCamel macchiatos are yummy as hell, go get one! I'm pretty sure they even have pizza! (Not that I would recommend combining the two!)"
0,"This Walgreens has the busiest parking lot ever no matter what time of day it is packed! Kind of weird as the store seems empty. It is a standard Walgreens but this one sells liquor. The store is old and run down, the staff seems a bit distant. \nI would never go out of my way to shop here, but it does get a pass for convenience."
0,Avoid at all costs!  New owners suck!
0,"The food was actually pretty good. The beers were average. The atmosphere was interesting. And the staff was attentive. So why only 2 stars?\n\nNo women customers was interesting. Even H**ters usually has women eating/drinking there. The place did kinda feel....dirty from the dust or smoke or something. And the waitresses were almost dressed, well, too scantily. (Yes, I really said that, I know...). I took a male coworker there and was almost embarrassed. I'm not sure I would have felt that way...upstairs."
0,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. \n\nNot only is it overrated, but over priced and run by the most rude people. \n\nMy first mistake was going on a Saturday. My girlfriend say the overwhelming, yet over zealous, reviews on Yelp and wanted to go. Upon entering we realized they were packed! We waited in line for a while with a family behind us that we made small talk with. We got to the counter and that's when it started, our horrible experience. It's a Crepe place, right? Well, anyone who has had crepes before knows they are not very filling. Seeing their menu, I was confused as to whether or not they had a full crepe meal. Second mistake: asking the owner/chef a question.\n\n The owner was running the cash register when we went to place our order and I asked a simple question: \""Do the crepes come in a meal?\"" Seems like a simple question to which there should be a simple answer, nope. The reply I got was \""I don't understand your question. I have stuffed crepes...\"" So I asked again, this time I explained myself. I wanted a meal, with eggs, bacon, hashbrowns...something other than one, thin crepe. The reply I got was much worse the second time around. He asked, \"" What does it say on the menu? Read it to me.\"" And that's when my jaw hit the floor. Did this a**hole just ask me if I could read?! Did he just insult me for entering his establishment?! Am I going to jail for putting this mans face on a hot skillet?! \n\nIn disbelief, I ordered a number one and did not walk out like I wanted to. My girlfriend wanted to stay and continue our nice (until now) Saturday. We ordered two crepes and a mimosa flight. The bill came to over thirty dollars! I not only paid for NOTHING but paid to be insulted. Then it took 45 minutes to get our food. The meal was only two crepes and watered down mimosa's. We were hungry within an hour after eating and pissed that we had to wait so long.  Not worth it. The family that had ordered behind us were still waiting for their food when we left. \n\nThis place might be trendy, and have neat decor, but it's small, doesn't have A/C (IN VEGAS!!), and is very over priced. Don't bother."
1,"Finally good decent Chinese food in the west valley and it's not expensive and they give you plenty of food. Why has it taken so long to find a good Chinese food place in the west valley?  Came here for lunch and the food was good, tasty, and man did they give you enough left overs for a second meal. Tried the chow mien lunch combo with fried rice, soup, crab Rangoon. Yum."
1,"One of the alloy wheels on my 2008 BMW was badly gouged by a \""cowboy\"" tire shop, and looked beyond cosmetic repair.  I happened upon this business through a review in Car and Driver magazine.  They work mainly with car dealers but also offer their services to the public.  The people could not have been more charming and the service was incredible.  The damage was too severe for their mobile service, so they took my wheel into their shop overnight and delivered it the next morning.  It is like a new wheel!  All for $125.  Highly recommended!"
0,"We had to pay almost $5.00 for a bowl of RICE!  I could not believe that the main dish did not come with anything else.  Everything is ordered separately.  I know it's Caesar's at the Las Vegas strip, but please, four entrees, four bowls of rice and three teas, one had water, cost over $100 for lunch!!!"
1,Great german beer made in Wisconsin sold here!!!! you must try it
1,"I love the Herb Box. My company previously ordered catering from the North Scottsdale location and that's when the addiction began. You would have to fight off coworkers for left over's. The food is always fresh and delish!  The ingredients are perfectly placed and you know what your getting is prepared with love . There isn't anything on the menu I don't like.  I am here at least 2 times a week for lunch, I keep checking the desserts for the peach and cream tart . Peach season is coming soon , so expect me lurking the whole month of May."
0,This place has gone downhill since Sprouts has taken over this location. The service is horrible now. With 6 or 7 employees behind the deli counter I was ignored like I wasn't even there. Finally an ugly little toad came over and asked me what I wanted. When I told him a sandwich he flipped a pad to me and said fill it out. When I asked for a pencil the toad just walked away. Meantime the other 6 employees milled around like they were too busy to help the growing line behind me. \n\nFinally I just left and did my shopping for the weekend at Whole Foods. Whole foods charges a little more but the experience and quality are un-matched by this Sprouts location.
0,Like any other whole foods. \n\nPrices is outrageous to a point where I rather go to AJ's fine foods. Atleast AJ's staff knows extensively what their product is and super friendly.  \n\nFor organic produce i rather go to sprouts. \n\nThanks but no thanks.
0,"It's a \""UPS\"" store.... you bring in a package... they take it... you wave goodbye to it... you leave.\n\nSometime after that a big Brown Truck arrives and wisks said package off to its destination. \n\nThis UPS Store was unremarkable... the guy behind the counter did his job... nothing more nothing less."
1,"This item is a must have for your walking tour of Vegas.  Fire and water fountain effects that look like real hot lava!\n\nRuns every hour starting at 5:00pm and ending at 11:00pm each night.\n\nThe railing fills up pretty quick, but this show is just as good from across the street - you can even feel the heat from the flames all the way across the street."
1,"Very nice especially being pregnant. Clean, peaceful atmosphere. First time at a foot spa, I will definitely be back."
0,"Took an hour and 15 minutes to deliver.  Forgot a topping on my pizza.  Sauce is terrible, tastes old and cheap.  The whole pizza seems cheap to be honest.  \n\nWings don't even have any sauce.  Mild is just a dry butter sauce here I guess?!?  Terrible, just tastes like a normal chicken wing.  \n\nWould never recommend or order again."
1,"If you're looking for a chain type Italian restaurant forget Olive Garden and come here. The food is creative without being fancy. Everything is fresh and tastes great. Good happy hour prices for appetizer (drinks not so much). Happy hour service was a little rough, I really hate when bartenders ignore younger patrons, but the $2.95 appetizers still made it a good deal. I love their Italian Wedding Cake Martini!"
1,"The $7 lunch special here is where it's absolutely at. Lots of my IRL friends don't like this place, but whatever, I love it. \n\nWinners on the lunch menu are the red curry, pad thai, basil chicken. Not so much winners are nothing I have tried yet. \n\nThe soups are always like a magical surprise. Will it be a coconut curry? An egg drop? Chicken deliciousness? I don't know, but I love knowing they'll put a taste of ecstasy in my mouth. (har har my name's Molly)\n\nI think I may even like this place better than Penn's of late. Penn's got too expensive and the food is also lukewarm most of the time. Siri Thai is small, awesome, and a great lunch spot. I'm probs gonna go get some now because I'm hungry for it. Ta-ta!"
0,"The food is okay. The staff used to be really nice then they hired a ghetto cashier with gauges in her ears. Unsanitary, if you ask me. I took my food back after they gave me a chicken enchilada plate when I ordered a cheese enchilada plate. I may have let it go if the enchiladas weren't so dry. They barely had a few tablespoons of sauce. After I asked for my order to be corrected, the cashier told the cook that I was a crazy b*tch in Spanish. Umm, excuse me? Did you forget I speak Spanish? Especially since I ordered everything IN SPANISH? geez. Bring the old cashier back. Then I'll give this place a good review."
0,"Ate here on Sunday night. The atmosphere was  a bit dull seeing it was in the Paris. The food was a bit commercial. I had the Capellini Pomodoro. It was very common and what you find at Olive Garden. Nothing stood out. The garlic bread was very good. The tirmaso was excellent also. The eggplant parmesan was smothered in sauce and cheese. I had to scrape it off to find what looked like a frozen factory made eggplant patty. There was also a bus girl (woman) that was setting tables and clearing. She looked very mad and when she brought water, she had a very bad attitude. Our waiter was Raymond. He was excellent and had a very funny sense of humor. He cracked us up and was the delight of the more then below standard restaurant."
0,"I dined here several months ago and thought I would throw my two cents in here. The place is decorated like your grandma's house in 1960. This might work if Maple Tree  was a separate house or cottage, but this joint is in a strip mall, so time to change the wallpaper dude. Of course, lousy wallpaper can be overlooked if the food is good. Perhaps I should have went for breakfast, but I was on a burger kick and me and a buddy went in for the Maple Burgers. This was supposed to have maple bacon, but i could not taste it - actually I could not even eat the thing and here is why. Ordering a well-done burger must bring out panic in some $10 hr grill guy's world because 60% can't cook it right, even when I say burn it. Well 45 minutes later with the place half-empty, still no burger. Eventually I had to ask for it to go and very lucky for maple Tree management that it went that route. I enjoy confronting owners and this burger after an hour was still not cooked to even a medium well. Fuming at my pad, I fired up my backup lunch and I wrote it off cause my buddy had paid,  but with the slow service, civil war-era decorations and lousy food, this place needs to be avoided."
1,"Walking in this place the first thing I notice is that it is tiny, the buffet is small, and it's a bit dark.  \nHowever, the food was pretty decent and very filling. It's easy, uncomplicated, and the narrow selection means the the individual food is better opting for a more focused quality to the food. \nThe price is always good, and it gets the job done. \nOnly reason why it is missing a star is because of the interior was pretty dark and old. \nIf you want a good enough selection of food, dirt cheap buffet prices, and an easy selection you will like this place."
1,I have been to a couple of the other Classic Car Spas and this location is by far the best. They do a great job and are very friendly.  My car is always immaculate. Chris was very helpful and didn't try to upsale me things I didn't need. I'll drive a few extra miles to come back here.
0,"This place was, eh, okay...but I probably won't go back.  The service was painfully slow and the food was simply average.  It wasn't bad, per se, but there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, that this one really isn't worth a second shot."
0,Over priced bland food. tight tops and short shorts don't distract from the fact that the meal took forever to be prepared. As for the DIFFRENT types of ketchup? They all tasted the same!!!
0,"Good music and nice interior but horrrrrrible security staff. Super rude and pushy. Nowhere to stand without getting yelled at to keep walking.. Unless you drop $2000 on a table good luck getting treated like a regular person. Wouldn't go back after how I was yelled at for not moving fast enough away from \""VIP\"" sections.. Guess I'm to regular chicagoan for all these bottles and bullshit. Ps dont bother with a package. We did and it wasn't worth the 1 hr open bar considering the shitty ass treatment we got.."
1,"This is a drive-through. I had no idea. I read several reviews, and I guess I just didn't realize that \""coffee hut\"" or \""pit stop\"" meant drive through. Just a warning in case anyone else out there is as out of the loop as I am. I arranged to meet a friend here for coffee not too long ago, and then felt like a total dufus.\n\nI swung by today to check it out, and for a drive-through, it was great! But when comparing it to other coffee houses, I just can't give it 5 stars because the whole \""let's hang out a coffee shop and chat\"" has been taken away from me. So it is really 4 out 4 stars - a perfect rating for a drive-through, but missing 20% of a coffee house.\n\nI had read some reviews, and ordered the Mexi-Mocha - my very fist one, and I asked for soy milk. Holy Yum! This might have been the very best coffee drink I have ever had. And the little white chocolate dinosaur egg was a really nice touch.\n\nOh, I almost forgot my other dufus tip: I don't know how many other places use a fancy coffee cup cover like the Human Bean does, but it is worth it to take a minute to figure it out before you start driving. There is a little sliding tab on the top; push it toward the sippy hole to \""close\"" the hole, and push it away in order to \""open\"" the hole and take a sip. Otherwise you might find yourself driving down the highway like me, trying to figure out why no coffee is coming out!"
1,"I like clubs. I like clubs even more when they aren't Mega.\nI like clubs that I can wear sneakers in.\nI like downtown.\nI like the Golden Nugget.\nThis all adds up to a winning formula.\n\nSeriously, this isn't one of the big fancy club for the kids, it's more of an adult scene that is fun, cheap and not so pretentious.\n\nHanging out on the patio overlooking Fremont is cool. As cheesy as downtown is, this place is a blast."
1,Max front end supervisor is the biggest reason I go to this Costco. Has that place on.lock down. Handles whatever is thrown at him. Will make a great manager one day
1,"One of the nice places to eat in Chambana where the prices are reasonable and the food is plain yummy!  Not a franchise - yeaaaahhhhh!  The atmosphere has a lot of character with stained glass and other antiques (some of the stories about the antiques are on the menu - very interesting).\n\nMy three kids and I all enjoyed our meals.  The hamburgers are excellent as are the shakes. Oh yes, the kids also loved the cookies in the front case were great on-the-road treats!"
1,"Fun!  The staff is terrific, so personable, although the service could be polished up a bit.  Really enjoyable atmosphere.  Owners run the shop and are very nice.  \n\nThe food was very tasty.  I had the Country Fried Steak and Eggs, with a pancake.  The fried steak was light, crunchy,with  very flavorful taste.  Eggs cooked  just right and the pancake was big and sweet.  \n\nMy girl had the Steak and Eggs, and she enjoyed it.  Steak cooked right.  She enjoyed that the eggs were cooked in butter (rather than oil).  She wants to go back to try the deep-fried chocolate-chip cookie dough, with bacon.  We'll go back.  \n\nThey just revitalized their menu and remodeled the inside decor.  Also, new kitchen equipment.  If you haven't been in the last couple weeks, go again.  Before word gets out, it gets too busy."
0,"This Walmart is so ghetto and dirty, hobos in the parking lot asking for money and people trying to exchange ebt cards for cash and Mexicans selling tamales in parking lot, I don't come here anymore I would rather drive to the nice Walmart on Decatur and 215 or go to fresh and easy if I need a few things, maybe if it wasn't so ghetto and full of thugs I might go, clean up your Walmart"
1,"I would stay here again. It's not perfect but I think we got good value for our money. To Brian F... I got cocktail service in the casino and I was with one other girl. I'm surprised that a guy wasn't getting served at the casino.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the cheesy butterfly decorations hanging from the ceiling and that, ugh you can smoke in public places in Nevada : ( All of that aside, we got an upgraded room on the 30th floor that was quite large. It was clean and modern and the bed and pillows were AMAZING.\n\nThe casino was really nice, it's not as bustling as Caesar's or Bellagio, but that was fine. The patisserie near the elevators was a major guilty pleasure with the gelato (they do samples) and crepes. The restaurants are ok. The Aria Cafe was better than we expected as was American Fish, but BarMasa is an epic fail.\n\nThe location is great, I don't think the tram is really value add because it goes from Bellagio to Aria and at times, I thought it would have been faster to take the Strip."
0,"Part of the buffet of buffet program. Came in for breakfast and it is pretty average if not weak. The omelet station is the one shining star, made a nice western omelet that was very well prepared. The rest of the buffet is just a collection of side dishes and standard breakfast fare, nothing special. The lucky charms are always a bonus. At first we tried the Caesars buffet but there is a $30 up charge for the holiday brunch so that will be our noontime destination. It looks pretty good, far more diverse than the Flamingo. The Flamingo had just one lonely ham as the carving station. Bottom line this is not the option with so many better ones right next door."
0,The barbeque that they serve must not be what they have won competitions with. Its just ok bbq with ok sides. Not impressed.
1,"I met a friend here and was a bit skeptical due to previous reviews. I am glad that did not change my mind about this place. It's more of a bar than a lounge, but thats ok. I still had a good time. \n\nThe people there was nice and didn't mind talking. A pool league was playing was tgat was interesting to watch. \n\nI don't know how this place was in the past, but my experince was great.   The bartender was interactive with the patrons. She made an awesome drink.\n\nI would definitely go back if i have the opportunity.\n\nThey are definitely  Raider fans. I prefer the Packers!"
1,"best service any music lover could ever ask for! i bought my first guitar from this location a while back and i recently just stopped in to buy my first pedal for my guitar. i have to say that Zachary (i believe thats his name.. slightly ginger hair, short scruffy beard) helped me out so much! he spent over an hour and a half with me showing me/ letting me play just about every pedal they had out. he not only took the time to teach me how the pedal worked and what certain settings do and what sounds they make (as I've never used a pedal before in my life) but he also really took an interest as to what sounds i am into as far as playing goes and was also showing me cool sounds with different combinations of pedals that he thought would work well with my sound. he didn't try and push me toward any certain pedal just to get me out of there, he helped me to experiment with each sound to let the right pedal find me. his expertise helped me narrow down the selection and ultimately pick the perfect pedal. i walked out of there feeling extremely confident and happy with the choice of pedal, i was super anxious to get home and start experimenting!!! i from now on will ALWAYS be buying any future pedals/guitars from this guitar center, they know what they are doing. thanks so much zachary!!"
1,"I have to be careful with hotel reviews.  I have 4-5 star aspirations on a 1-3 star budget. I must be careful not to rate a 2.5-star hotel poorly just because it doesn't have the offerings of a higher-rated property.  And this is indeed a 2.5 star property.\n\nBased on Expedia and AAA, stars refer to services and amenities more than aesthetics.  Hotel #1 with high-percale, Egyptian bedding but no internet, limited room service and no on-site eateries will be lower-rated than hotel #2 that has those services, even when hotel #2's rooms have cheaper furniture and lower quality bedding.  So I use stars along with customer reviews to determine whether I might like a hotel. \n\nFor me, hotels in old Vegas/Fremont are fine as 2-star properties because I'm not there for the hotel. I'm there for the wackiness known as Fremont. I'm not a gambler;  $10 - $20 on the slot machine will last me all weekend. I care more about the food, internet and about room safety and comfort than anything.  \n\nI stayed in the renovated tower section of the El Cortez, and I should say that I won a free hotel weekend through my travel agency.  That won't affect my review (although it might have gotten me the renovated tower room with the Strip view, a perk about which I will not complain!)   \n\nUpon entering the room I was struck with the comfy look and design. It doesn't come across as small.  While the nearby California Hotel was almost comical in its extreme plainness, this room has homey-looking, interesting furnishings, like brass pineapple lamps.  It even has a cute little sitting area by the window. Truth to tell, the loveseat was very light-weight and the coffee table looked like it came from a garage sale. Somehow, this all came together for a  home-away-from-home feel.  The room was quite clean, the view was great, and I appreciated the multitude of lighting fixtures.   The TV is the older, bulky kind. Internet was $11.99 for 24 hours PER DEVICE. That's just crazy. I tried it with my iPhone and found it to be decent quality with little to no lag or disconnects. There doesn't appear to be internet in the public areas.\n\nThe bathroom was odd- VERY tiny. The toilet/tub/shower room is separate from the sink area. The shower is basically no different than one  you might install in your own home- a Home Depot-style plastic molded shower insert.  As tiny as the sink area was, the \""closet\"" and the safe were packed in there as well.   Tiny, folks.  There wasn't even a light over the sink- light came from the toilet room or from the sitting area.   \n\nThe beds were comfortable enough, with three pillows each (I like extra pillows).  I liked the room a lot, really- just not the bathroom.\n\nWhenever I stay in a hotel I purposely order room service.  Room service here is overpriced but is served promptly and my breakfast was really good. It apparently comes from the 24-hour Cafe Cortez. I kinda liked the Cafe. If I were a regular here, I could see myself with my newspaper or magazine,  sitting alone there and drinking my coffee.  The international waitstaff are attentive and friendly.\n\nI got a really nice credit for the Flame steakhouse, so I invited a friend to eat there with me. The hotel was also giving guests a free bottle of Mondavi wine.  The small (but uncrowded) space, low lighting and live pianist give the place a slightly sophisticated air, but the sight of some of the patrons in jeans and old T-shirts knocked down the sophistication level by a few points. The wait staff were friendly.\n\nI had the French onion soup as my appetizer, which tasted fine. My friend got the crab cakes and we were both surprised by the small size of the two cakes compared to the price charged for them.  They were tasty, though.  As for entrees, my friend ordered the salmon. I liked it a lot- juicy, moist, nicely seasoned. Companion said she LOVED it. We both liked the accompanying bed of \""sea beans\"" - now, that was a creative touch!  \n\nI got the shrimp scampi, which was shrimp on a bed of linguini. I didn't really love my entree; the sauce tasted a little dull. It wasn't horrid but for $21 I wouldn't order it again.  We shared an apple strudel for dessert and were totally unimpressed because there was absolutely nothing special about it.  \n\nOur meal, including the $15 white zinfadel, came to over $80 (covered mostly by my credit), and for that price I want to be wowed.  If they want to maintain their prices, I'd like to see originality and a more sophisticated decor. Those sea beans stood out because out of everything, they were a new experience, and well-prepared.  People don't mind paying extra for the creatively (and deliciously) unusual.  More of that, please!\n\nSo would I come back? Yes, I would. The place is old-fashioned and homey, but that's a selling point. It's near Fremont Street. Great staff, decent price.  I'm trying the Cabana suites next."
1,"Got the roast pork Loco moco. It was really good. Only qualm I have is when I asked if they could add a burger patty to it, I was told that it would cost an extra 7.50... $7.50???? MIGHT AS WELL GET ANOTHER FREAKIN LOCO MOCO. GG. Regardless, food was still really good."
0,"First time customer with my husband and kids and friends. The other patrons consisted of mostly families with children and older adults. The service was fine, the food also was decent bar fare. My problem was with the noise. The volume of the music in the restaurant was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard. This was at 4 in the afternoon mind you, and I felt as though I was in a pick up bar at midnight. I not wimpy or old, but have no interest in fighting to be heard above Kati Perry singing at a ridiculously high decibel. Sorry to say I will not be back."

The burgers didnt have many options.   No list of anything fancy or unexpected.  Just a pretty standard burger. \n\nOh but the fries are served in a mini shopping cart, so thats just sooooo cool, that it makes up for everything else being just so-so...  \n\nWait, no... my mistake... the fries delivery system doth not make up for an otherwise Meh experience.   NEEEEEEXT!"
0,Completely worthless pharmacy! The pharmacy tech was extremely rude and the pharmacist just stood there and allowed it. Went in 20 minutes before they closed and it was completely dead. Everyone was standing there looking at each other. I needed a prescription for my extremely sick infant and they refused to fill it until the next morning. I guess their conversation about Easter was far more important than my projectile vomiting infant.
1,"I'm surprised this place doesn't get good reviews.  I went out here for a night out in Mill with some friends and I had a lot of fun.  This place attracts a very friendly crowd of college kids and young professionals.  What more can you ask for a scene?  You can dance anywhere you like, it's a NINERS bar (I think), and it's a huge venue that's got everything you need in a bar."
1,"seriously, the BEST sushi ever!!!!!!!! i'm asian n i grew up in cali and this is BY FAR the best sushi ever!!!! :)"
0,"Walked in to the sight of the hostess and all the wait staff texting on their phones. Bartender said we could seat ourselves. Waited for about 15 minutes- didn't even get waters. There was more staff on hand than patrons, so there was no reason for any kind of wait. Poor service, total lack of professionalism... Went to the Mexican grill next door and had drinks in less than 3 minutes. I suggest going there instead!"
0,I threw up after eating here. Very unpleasant.
0,"I was recommended this place by a local foodie who is very picky. He swears by the place so I trusted him.\n\nThe location is nice, and pretty cool inside. The menu is impressive and has a lot of cool ideas. The food that I ate however was not any good.\n\nI paid so much to get so little and what little I got was not impressive at all. I was actually embarrassed as I brought a few friends from out of town there and they also thought the food was gross. I felt like they would never trust my judgement again."
1,Place is so cool...Small but very hip..clean and staff is so friendly. I had the Giai juice and was so pleased. DK pasta is great and fresh. If you are looking for something fresh and different this is the spot.
0,"I see a lot of really great reviews here for this place. I think it boils down to the type of place you are looking for. My thing is finding little family run ethnic places where the food is good and the prices low. Service is important, but decor and ambiance are non-factors to me. On the other hand, if you like average food served up with old, piped in mariachi music and fake, yet expensive, Mexican decor, this would be your place. \n\nMy family, when they visit from Indiana, like it just fine. They enjoy it. But to me the food was bland to average. We had a good variety of stuff on our first visit--I had a build it yourself combo plate and Carol had a shrimp dish, can't recall now which one. Average, as I said. The salsa was awesome though. Second visit, salsa still good, other stuff, still average. \n\nConsidering how slow they were when we visited, the service was not great--slow and only marginally friendly. This was on both trips--the first time when it was just Carol and I, and a second time when I went with my family. That second trip it seemed like maybe the owner or a manager was waiting tables and building up a pretty bad attitude about. \n\nBottom line...if you  like the real deal take a pass. If you don't mind this style, give it a try. It looks good and is not terrible."
1,"Came back last night with friends. The service has improved, servers were more attentive than the previous experience. I was recommended the clams with lemon pepper seasoning. It was really salty, I wouldn't try it again. Before that I had the Louisiana style and that sure tasted better. This time around, I gave the hot and juicy seasoning a try, and it was pretty good. I recommend everything in the hot and juicy seasoning bc it wasn't salty."
1,"Best place to get away from people in the valley!  This is a very under utilized trailhead that has tons to offer if you like variety.  It is great for easy hiking, mountain bikers, and great for walking dogs.\n\nThis is a great park to \""wander\"" more than stick to a designated trail.  There isn't much change in elevation, except for the butte, so there are no issues with getting lost.  The most interesting part is Big Butte Loop, which is a circular path that hugs the butte.  Here is where you will get the most elevation challenge where you go up and down the washes.\n\nFor the more adventurous, you can scurry up the south face of Big Butte...just aim for the cave.  This is not for everyone as it's not marked as a trail and will require use of your hands as well as your feet.  This allows you to get to the eastern peak and the views are amazing.  Your dog's four paws will put you to shame going up and over Big Butte. ((((Again, this is not a marked trail and do not attempt if uneasy with heights))))\n\nAscend the butte close to sunrise or sunset, if you're lucky, you will hear the Howler Monkeys from the Phoenix Zoo sounding off!  \n\nMy hike typically takes about an hour, start east from the parking lot, up or around Big Butte, coming back the west side of Little Butte Loop, back to the parking lot.\n\nThis is not quite the challenge of Camelback, but only crossing paths with maybe 10 people is priceless!  \n\nOh, and you can also run the stairs of the amphitheater if you're looking for a great place to do leg work."
0,"I had the vegan sandwich. For the price, I was expecting a fabulous sandwich. The bread was stale and the dressing made my mouth tingle for awhile after I was finished eating. Quite a disappointment."
0,"only giving a two  because it's 247. drinks.. blah. espresso.. Bleh! someone walked off with my phone there too when i went to the bathroom. wtf!!! employees were extremely unhelpful when asked if they noticed anyone walk up to where i was sitting (plain view of the counter). i canceled the phone 30minutes later when i got home, six international calls made from it from the time it was walked off with.  don't bother trying to call this place either the phone doesn't get answered. or at least didn't. did I mention the espresso is BLEeh??"
1,Love this place!!! :)
1,"BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on \""PA n'at with Dave and Dave\"" and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a \""Battleship\"" and it was literally 3 feet long, just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  \n\nIt's great, fast food.  I can't wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship."
0,"I wasn't very hungry so had the beef carpaccio. My god what a mess!  Unfortunately the chef has taken a classic, simple, delicious Italian staple and tried to turn it into a Vegas extravaganza but got 'un disastro' by covering great quality beef with a slime of sauces.  Underneath this Pollockesque creation lies a few greens on a cube of fried polenta. Oh it pretends to be Italian so lets chuck a bit of polenta in somewhere."
1,Favorite place to stop on my way home from downtown. Just like the tacos u get on the streets in mexico city. But better quality beef.

1,"Very cheap suites if you don't mind being off the strip. Beds are decent, restroom is roomy, shower takes a bit to get hot. \n\nNot that many tables to gamble at but they do have this black jack table called super fun black jack and it was only $3 minimum. Regular black jack is only $5 sometimes. \n\nThey also have a poker room and looks like there is a decent of people who play.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't mind staying if you don't want to be on the strip.\n\nParking is also free!"
0,The atmosphere was nice. The potato soup was yummy. Decent service. After that everything else stinks. Over priced bland food.
0,Wasn't good at all.
1,"This was a great cool addition to the strip.  A mini strip all with restaurants, bars and shops.  This is where you find the \""High Roller Ferris Wheel\"".  The Linq is located between Harrah's and Flamingos and the Quad.  The Bolt bus station is also located here, near the Ferris Wheel.  I'm happy to see a Ghiradelli's ice cream shop here."
0,"This place is your run of the mill older / outskirt large casino. Comparable to a Coast casino or something like that if you are picking up what I'm throwing down.\n\nIt's great for a cheap game of craps and a way to spend some time with old folks. After my experience I'm not sure if I'd throw anymore money at the food here, but at least they've got a theater to burn some time at too."
1,"I love food and since I travel often on business and dine at the finest restaurants I have seen my fair share of places.\n\nThis buffet is fantastic value for money and the food is perfectly fine. If you are coming here expecting to pay $10 for a $40 per plate meal you are just being silly of course.\n\nI have been here twice with my Family, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both visits were fantastic. \n\nOn the second visit we were 7 people and nobody complained about a single dish.\n\nWe were seated immediately, drinks were on the table in under 5 minutes and every time I went back for more my plate was gone when I got back.\n\nI tried quite a variety of dishes and they were all great tasting and perfectly warm (for all the complainers in the other reviews). \n\nLoved the coconut shrimp, the duck was pretty good, egg rolls were good, Wonton Soup was good, the wonton in it was average. The noodle dishes were very tasty, those chicken kebabs were great.\n\nThe sushi bar does not have much variety but what they have is pretty good\n\nAs expected none of the dishes completely blew me away as the best I ever had, but that is not what I expected at the price so 5 stars it is.\n\nMy family thoroughly enjoyed both visits and constantly nag me to go back.\n\nOn our way out my 3-year old boy asked for a second fortune cookie and was promptly handed as many as he could carry (I think it was about 15) to take home !"
1,Nice venue for a show with a separate lounge and outdoor seating area. Good service and great bands. Get out and support downtown Phoenix.
1,"Went to Mundo for lunch on a weekday. Very busy, a lot of business people and elected officials and other dignitaries were there. Seems like a local hotspot being near the county offices.  We ordered the Chilean Seabass tacos, and the skirt steak salad.  Both were delicious, well cooked, and perfectly seasoned.  Service was prompt, our waiter was knowledgeable, and the price was great."
0,"Ah, there's nothing worse than crushing disappointment on a Sunday morning.  Well, maybe I'm being a wee bit melodramatic, but when I'm famished I tend to get cranky.  Joe's Diner is a hop skip and a jump away from our house and I've been driving past it for months thinking \""hmm... wonder if that place is any good\"" .  So this morning, in what I thought at the time to be a flash of brilliance, I looked up Joe's Diner on Yelp (which very rarely leads me astray) and to my delight this neighborhood establishment had a 4 star average.  Not too shabby, and certainly worth a shot, right?! WRONG.  We walked in and it was busy (expected on a Sunday morning) and we were quoted a 10-15 minute wait. Fair enough.  But it was absolutely swelteringly hot and humid inside (swamp cooler maybe?!) and smelled funny (raw eggs left out?).  Still, we waited-- there had to be a good reason this place got 4 stars.  As promised, in about 12 minutes, the hostess lead us to the back seating area, but not to a table, and then just left us there standing, bewildered.  A few minutes later, another employee saw us there looking lost and hastily wiped off a nearby table and told us we could sit down.  Once seated, we were surrounded by tables of screaming children (not the establishment's fault by any means, but definitely did not improve our experience).  As we sat for 15 minutes, without so much as a glance from any of the servers, we soaked in the sweaty, stinky, dirty (did I mention the floors were filthy?), loud atmosphere.  It appeared there was no hope of acknowledgement by a server, much less a glass of water or a desperately needed cup of coffee, so we threw in the towel.  We stood up and walked out, defeated, hungry, non-caffinated, sweaty and disappointed, again without so much as a glance from any of the staff.  \n\nI want to believe that this was just an unusually bad day, maybe because it was a busy Sunday, maybe because the stars weren't aligned, who knows... and that Joe's Diner really does deserve it's 4 stars.  I'd love to have a decent (if not awesome) locally owned breakfast establishment nearby, but I don't know if Joe's is that place.  Will we be back to give it another go?  Maybe, only if we're feeling optimistic,  patient, cool, and pre-cafinated."
0,"The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And, in looking at other reviews, I am not the first.  There are many options at the Waterfront, and I would suggest you try any of them; but stay far away from this place!"
1,"Very pretty ambiance.  Food was stellar.  Had a great meal prix fixe on a Friday night.  My ceviche starter was made with Aj\u00ed amarillo, the authentic Peruvian chile sauce that lends a hint of smoky flavor/kick.  I love that but it could have used a bit more - no worries, a shot of sriracha did the trick table side.  Main entree was a swordfish steak with a pepper coulis - delish.  People that like desserts would love this - I had 5 minis in front of me when I only picked 1 from the prix fixe.  Bonus!"
1,"This restaurant is a real treat. Fellas, if you want to impress your girl, take her here! It is away from the strip and situated inside Green Valley Ranch. It is beautifully furnished and decorated with crystal chandeliers in each room. This is top of the line luxury here. It is a bit pricey since sides are sold a la carte and two steak entrees can easily reach around $150. But if you want a fine steak and maybe want to celebrate a monumental moment in your life this is definitely the place to go."
1,"What a great place for dinner! It's nice to dine at a place that's fancy enough and welcomes children at the same time.  They were very flexible about our reservation and service was prompt, courteous, and attentive.  \n\nFor starters, my husband had oysters and I had the sardines (of course!).  Dinner for me were mussels and frites which were very addictive to eat and my husband had the mahi-mahi.  And yes...we fed our children and they had buttered orrichiette. We skipped dessert but I'm sure that would've been good too.  Does this have better food than Nostranos?  Maybe...but what this place had was a welcoming atmosphere which is more than I can say about the pretentious ambience at Nostranos!"
0,"9/23\n\nHad a friend meet me here for Restaurant Week.  We both weren't dressed for the Phoenician, but I didn't care (and soon, he didn't either).  It's a good thing, too, bec. in the end, we found that this place wasn't ostentatious nor that pretentious.  Dressed casually, we still managed to have a good time, despite the overall lackluster dining experience.\n\nFirst off, let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit.  By the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices, more than 20 minutes had elapsed.  ($15 for a glass of Cab and $11 for a tiny glass of mimosa?  Are you serious??)  Our first plate, a sub-par Caesar salad, arrived close to an hour after we were seated.  But perhaps the fault wasn't entirely J&G's... Digestif's Caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors, I'd say.  How about I testify that tonight's salad was crispy.  That's saying something nice, right?  No flavor, no creamy eggy goodness, but somewhat crispy.  The decimated croutons didn't help the situation...\n\nFor the entree, we had the skirt-steak & frites.  The latter weren't any better than what you would find at McDonalds'.  (Seriously, I'm not making this up.  Just check out the photos and you'll see I'm all about the truth!)  But the skirt steak!  This baby wasn't much to gaze at, but it was tasty.  Let's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad, a cheap cut of steak, three beverages, and tip.  \n\nNow onto the star of the show... chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream!  Wait for it... homemade caramel ice cream!  And chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star.  Oh. My. Freakin'. God.  This should be renamed \""Foreplay.\""  \n\nNice ambience, despite it being darker than I would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views.  I appreciated the privacy, though.  Women's restroom was clean and orderly, and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch.  The grounds looked pretty, but I was more impressed w/ the property at The Arizona Grand..."
0,The service was HORRIBLE! The waitress didn't even talk to us or even give us a menu until we had been sitting there for 20 min!
0,"A quiet bar out in Middleton, it's certainly not the worst, but it ain't the greatest either.\n\nHaving now played 2 sessions of their \""intermediate\"" volleyball leagues, I'm wishing the second one ended sooner.  They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water.  I've heard rumors of sand volleyball...in the snow.  Maybe I'm just bitter. cold.\n\nThe food is nothing worth writing home about.  The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent.  I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star.  Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials.  Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking.\n\nThe TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell.  There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used.They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well.\n\nThe bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you.  After my 4th or 5th trip there (again, because of the volleyball league), they were friendly and joking around with the crew."
0,This place has been a joke everytime I've gone. I only go when friends go & everytime the worst experience ever. You get poor service on all fronts.
0,Poor service. Waited too long for waitress ( Kim) to take our order.  not happy. Will very likely eat somewhere else next time.
0,"Service was terrible, but food was delivered promptly. It seems as if this business don't value their customers. Food was alright- nothing special. Will not come back because of lack of friendliness."
0,"This place is a crap hole. Stayed here approximately 4 times and progressively it's gotten worse. We are staying in the \""newer\"" tower rooms. Motel 6 had better furniture. The dresser and nightstand were scratched, chipped and pieces of wood missing. To add onto that joy, every time we came back at night we had to fight for parking spaces and didn't get one tonight. So...we are now in a 30 minute valet line to park. Horrible. And never again will I stay here. Stay anywhere else and you'll have a better experience!"
1,"Planet Hollywood's Heart Bar may not be everyone's idea of a good time, but it makes a great start (or end, in my case) to an evening of partying. It's relaxed in the early AM, not gaudy (especially for Vegas), offers comfortable seating, and a good view of the go-go dancers at the Pleasure Pit.\n\nMy friendly bartender wasted no time (his name was Dave, so of course he had to be) getting me an orange juice ($3), the perfect end of a night full of screaming and drinking non-orange juice drinks. At the bar you can play video casino games; I had the inexplicable urge to play video poker on the electronic screen, but decided not to when I remembered I didn't know poker...\n\nHeard their regular drinks are crazy expensive, so if you're not a cheap date, gamble on the casino floor and get your drink on for free - but don't forget to tip your server[1].\n\n[1] If you see Yara, be extra nice to her, and tell her hi from me! She rocks."
1,"This is by far the best experience I have ever had in a jewelry store. Let me say up front that I don't have a lot of disposable income. Starbucks twice a week is a stretch for me. I went into Cartier in the Scottsdale Fashion Square next to the Neiman Marcus just outside of Dillard's expecting the same treatment I get from the staff at Tiffany's - snooty and aloof. \nWhat I got was shocking, and unexpected. Granted, my boyfriend and I were the only people in the store, but as I approached the ring section, I expected to just gaze in awe as always without service, or at least, with a glare. What shocked me is that the salesperson came over quickly, smiled, and asked if I'd like to try a few on. \""Sure!\"" I squealed. \nI'm not a diamond person, but I was enthralled to get this level of service. After gazing at a few on my finger, I thanked her profusely, as, of course, I thought she knew I couldn't afford it, but was being nice. She actually encouraged me to try on more and I ended up with a 2 carat sparkler on my finger, gazing at my boyfriend longingly. That, Cartier, was awesome. \nThe grand finale was when, I thought it was all over, and this salesperson (who at that point had become as dear to me as a favorite girlfriend playing dress up with mom's jewelry box) brought over, on a pillow of black velvet, a 9 carat yellow diamond surrounded by two 3 carat white diamonds (yes that's 15 carats total) and said, \""Why don't you try this one, too?\"" \nI almost cried. \nAs I removed it from my finger and prepared to leave, she brought me a brochure of the most beautiful linen paper and photos and asked me to take it with me to see if there was anything I might like in the future. \nI am 27k, was wearing jeans (not designer) and had on no make up whatsoever. \nWhat Cartier gets, or at lest, this salesperson gets, is that a purchase of that magnitude is a long term investment that should be preceeded and followed by a positive relationship. I will never by anything from Tiffany's again. Cartier, it's love, and I'm in it for the long haul."
0,Seriously get it together people. I was so disappointed with the service here. The guy behind the counter was a complete jerk. Then one of the customers before me order a bagel with salmon on it and the kid behind the counter cam out to tell him that nothing was prepped and it was going to take 10 mins for his bagel.  That's fine but can't u just slap some cream cheese on my bagel so we can keep the food comming out? If I wanted to wait 20 mins for food I would have gone to a restaurant. This location need some serious training and team work to pull this place together
0,"I got a coupon for an oil change.  Talk about bait and switch.  It offered $19.95, but after giving me sort of ridiculous excuses, the charge for my beetle was going to be $39.95 !!!  And they said it used 8 qts of oil (I wonder where they would put it !!).  I guess their bankruptcy has inflated their costs....  I told them not to bother sending me coupons anymore and wasting my time."
1,"My husband and I went to Scarpetta on our recent anniversary trip.  It was amazing!  We started out with the scallops appetizer and it was great, delicious and cooked perfectly.  My husband had the spaghetti and I had the stracci.  Both dishes were delicious.  We ended the night with a gingerbread pear crisp with cinnamon ice cream.  Everything had was great.  To make the night even better, the service was the best we could ask for.  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.  We will definitely be back when we go to Vegas again."
1,"Good, fresh, mexican in a fun environment. Staff is always pleasant even when dealing with tons of drunks. The food can be kind of heavy but that comes with the territory. It's also a bit expensive to standard mexican restaurants but I think you're paying more for the experience in which case I think the price is worth it."
1,"While I am all for having healthy and affordable lunch options Downtown I am not a pita person and thusly my attitude towards the Pita Pit is I could really take it our leave it. Why would a person who doesn't like Pitas go to a Pita pit, that remains a good question??? \n\nThe ingredients are very fresh. In my mind they are burrowing the Subway assembly line idea but instead of bread they use pitas. I enjoy fresh veggies and fast service but would enjoy them more so at another restaurant where the pita doesn't come with. \n\nI am giving four stars because they're doing what they're advertising which is putting things in a Pita and doing it with efficiency  too."
1,I had the pleasure of having the grilled bread pudding for breakfast recently. It was so rich and delicious!\n\nLiberty Market has a wonderful feel to it - very inviting and relaxing. The bathrooms are completely adorable with each stall having its own theme.
1,"Recently we had the opportunity to cover the Hyatt Place Phoenix/Mesa hotel. The hotel is located in the Mesa Riverview Shopping Center which provides guests with tons of shopping, dining and entertainment options such as the Cinemark Cinemas and Toby Keith's I love This Bar and Grill.\n\nThe hotel is very warm and inviting and this was evident from the very speedy check in and our room which was available to us almost 90 minutes earlier than the anticipated 3:00 PM check in time.\n\nOur room was a spacious suite that came with a king sized bed which overlooked the pool area.\nA large and comfy couch with an Ottoman and partial divider divided the suite which also featured a work desk, free Wi-Fi, a mini fridge, and coffee maker.\n\nA 42 inch flat screen television was a nice touch and having 41 stations including HBO gave us plenty of viewing options. The hotel also offered first run movies, adult and family movies, as well as music and on demand entertainment options for an additional fee.\n\nThe entertainment console also had a connection area where guests could connect their gaming consoles, laptops, and projectors to the television should they wish to play games, watch movies, or make a presentation in their room.\n\nThe staff was very helpful and friendly and not only answered our questions and addressed our needs whenever they arose, but also engaged us and other quests in conversations during our stay.\nThe hotel offers a complimentary breakfast which included milk, juice, coffee, tea, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, French Toast, cereals, yogurts, fruit, and breads, as well as some very good oatmeal. \n\nThe hotel also has a nice assortment of salads, snacks, sandwiches, and drinks that are available from their Gran and Go area, and quests can enjoy a range of drinks, sandwiches, appetizers, and other options 24/7 from the Gallery Menu.\n\nThe hotel offers free papers during the week, and for guests on the go, a selection of sundries such as toothpaste, razors and other toiletries are available free of charge.\n\nThe pool area is very enjoyable as not only does it have a pool and Jacuzzi, but there is a big screen television that retracts allowing guests to cool off in the pool and still watch the big games.\nAt night the area comes alive in a light show as the pool area is decorated with a kaleidoscopic light display.\nFor those wanting a more intense workout, the hotel offers a gym that allows for guests to get any form of exercise that they wish.\n\nFor those wanting something less aerobic, the hotel offers a putting area where guests can borrow clubs and balls to practice their putting.\n\nThe hotel was an ideal place to work and relax as we were able to get our work done while watching the days football games without any noise or other distractions. After a day of work, we went out to the nearby offerings, many of which are within walking distance and enjoyed some of the dining and shopping options that were offered.\n\nThe hotel is located close to Sky Harbor Airport as well as several of the area malls and attractions due to the close proximity of the freeway.\n\nIf your looking for a great place to stay on business or pleasure or to mix it up with a nice weekend away, the hotel is a perfect place for all of your needs. We cover many hotels as part of our work and I can honestly tell you that this was one of the cleanest and nicest hotels we have covered and the staff and service were first rate.\n\nWe look forward to a future visit as it was a great place to mix work and pleasure and relax.\n\nYou can get more information and book your reservations at ..\n\nhttp://phoenixmesa.place.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html"
1,"THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE SPOT!!  After spending a frustrated night at other clubs...ahem, TAO.....this place totally restored my faith in Vegas clubs.  \n\nThis was my first time going here; it was a recommendation from my cousin (thank you cuz!)   Love the swanky French decor, waitresses in cute little French maid costumes, and the music was off the chart!!  The outside area under the Eiffel Tower was super cool.  I felt like such a tourist!  Drinks were a little pricey, but totally worth the money.  There was quite an eclectic mix of people which I soooo dig!  It was a little bit on my crowded side on the inside, but once you've reached the outside area, it was a ascent into hedonism.  Four words to describe that feeling...\""HELL TO THE YEAH!!\"""
1,Tried out this place and sought out their italian beef sandwich. It was a monster and nearly impossible to manage eating. Glad I had this one to go... probably would have looked crazy trying to eat it in public! lol
0,"I hate to be the odd man out but the previous revues must have been friends of the owner.  The Bolognese lacked flavor and the pasta was gummy and stuck together in a clump.  The Spiga salad advertised salami and pancetta\nAnd if there was one ounce of meat in it I could not find it.  My calamari was inedible and looked like it came from the frozen food case at Safeway. The dipping sauce with it was flavorless.\nOn the plus side the space is great with a good vibe.  If you go for vibe and space go, if you go for good food go somewhere else.  A generous 2 stars.\nAs usual North Scottsdale people confuse with flash with real quality cuisine. The I noticed that several great reviews that were the first ever in yelp, obviously planted by friends of the owner.  By the way the server agreed the calarmi  was terrible and removed it from my check"
0,"For being on the Strip, and holding up a reputation, the price was comparable but the quality was just not.... there. There wasn't much to choose from.... no salad toppings for salads, incomplete good stations, lots of empty slots and not even chicken in the chicken fajitas pan. I checked. Twice. If you want GOOD quality, try Bayside Buffet in Mandalay Bay.  This food was bland, sad and not very tasty. The best two items I found were the grapefruit juice from the drinking stations and the Heath Bar cheesecake. But.... it just isn't worth the money."
1,"This place is awesome for lunch and they have amazing pizza! I was suprised as I am a pizza purist from Chicago. Great sauce. If you try to go here on the weekend, you're going to wait in line unless you know someone at the door or have a table. Always packed on Friday and Saturday night. Great DJs and overall vibe. The crowd can be overwhelming and a bit annoying to navigate through. Definite recommendation"
0,"What era is this?\n\nThat was my first thought as I stepped into this restaurant.  Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \""Scarface.\""  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner. \n\nI came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.   \n\nThe menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc. \n\nFor starters, we all shared the Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam. \n\nWe all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g)\n\nFor my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture. \n\nA few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.\n\nDessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg).  The Tiramisu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A) was average.. not great and not bad. \n\nIn my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check."
1,"This place is brand new, clean, and reasonably priced."
1,"The food is great! no doubt!  The resturant is pretty cool too.  My kids actually enjoy the place, and eat the food and they always get to pick their favorite candy when they are done from all the old fashion candies.  Every once and awhile their line gets backed up pretty far, but i guess most resturants have that problem on a Saturdays.  The problem could be fixed with a little rearranging of a few things but it isn't that big of a deal.  We will go back many times in the future."
1,Definatly here for the pizza. Provel cheese YUMMM!!!!
1,"I went here for the first time with my wife yesterday having expectations that this was going to be similar to a Black Angus or Outback. We got there at about 7:30PM, which seemed like the tail end of their dinner rush. I could see several open tables, but was told that it was going to be a 25 minute wait. Normally I would have walked away then but my wife really wanted a steak and options in Surprise are limited.\n\nDespite the open tables we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. After sitting down, we waited around for another 15 minutes to get our drink orders in and another 10 minutes after that to actually get our drinks and bread. Service was very slow.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that she was overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned to her, which is probably a management issue.\n\nWhile waiting for our food I checked the restaurant out and it was very clean (I would hope that it would be because the building is less than a year old). The only place that seemed to need some attention was the restroom. It looked like it had been hit by a dinner rush crowd and was is need of a cleaning.\n\nWhen our food arrived it looked very appetizing. My wife order the filet mignon and I had the parmesan crusted chicken breast. We both ordered the baked potato as a side with a side salad to start. I thought that all the food was great and worth the wait.\n\nThe filet mignon was very tender and prepared perfectly. The chicken was good but I wish I had ordered the steak after tasting my wife's. The salad was fresh and the baked potato was good. In all the food was very good.\n\nThis places food is great, but the service isn't. If I'm going to shell out $90 for two dinners, one appetizer, and four adult beverages I would hope for much better service.\n\nThis could be a five star spot if not for the service."
1,"Dined here twice during my stay at the Biltmore - dinner and breakfast. Both were delicious. \n\nDinner\nThey serve complimentary bread with dinner. Its an Italian style white bread with garlic in it, served with honey pecan goat cheese spread. Both are delicious on the their own but imo, sweet goat cheese doesn't really go with garlic bread. \n\nI ordered the Cesar salad with salmon (Not listed on the menu, they charge you $10 for the salmon which I thought was a bargain). The salmon was pan seared and cooked beautifully. They have a garlic-Cesar dressing and it is out of this world! My only  critiques are that the croutons are a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if they make them in house, but they seemed boxed. Also, there was too much cheese in the salad. \n\nBreakfast\nI order the ricotta flap jacks. They are served with (a huge scoop) of vanilla bean butter, blueberry compote and maple syrup. Very good! The flap jacks are light and fluffy and a nice change from regular old pancakes. They also happily swapped out the compote for fresh berries upon request. \n\nI tried some of their regular pancakes and these were really good too - a huge portion too. \n\nIf you order coffee, they'll leave a huge pot at the table. \n\nI'm a little cautious of resort restaurants-sometimes they're overpriced and don't deliver but this place is awesome! The food is good and the menu is diverse. The prices are reasonable.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place."
0,This place absolutely SUCKS!  It's super expensive for crappy food. The bartender doesn't know how to make a whiskey sour. The server I had was named buddy and he was crap too. Such an expensive place and they still hand you a to go box instead of doing it themselves. Real classy. What a horrible redone place. Beef eatery atleast was good.
0,"Came through the drive-thru for a quick bite to eat. I was appalled by the poor service we received. While placing our order, the girl at the window had an attitude as if we were inconveniencing her by placing our order. She kept trying to rush us even though we had more items to add to our order. Then upon pulling up to the window, we were given the wrong item. When we brought it to her attention, no apology whatsoever. There was just a whole air of poor customer service. Now I remember why I was never a big fan of Del Taco. Will be awhile before I return to this location."
1,Best brewery food in the valley- pumpkin porter is awesome- good consistent food- lots of tvs for watching sports!
0,"Went here last Friday evening with my dad for father's day. I usually go to the one in Tempe (where I've never had as many issues) but chose this one because it's a larger building and closer to dad's place. \nAs soon as I walked in, there was a weird smell. It wasn't a food smell but a people smell (an intimate people smell.... ugh). I assume that was because of the cooling issue, which I'll talk about further on...\n\nI opted for sitting at the bar because it was pretty full and a little too warm to sit outside (though there were plenty of people far braver than I). Also, when I've sat at the bar in the Tempe location, the employees have always been jovial and friendly and up for a good chat. I wasn't so lucky this time.\n\nFor starters, we got the creamy tomato soup. It came with croutons and a few slices of home-made soda bread and butter. I've never ordered their soups before and it was awesome! I'll definitely get this next time I eat at the Tempe one. \nMain course: dad got the Philly cheese steak pasty (he's not one for tradition, I guess) and I went for my favourite - meat (2 types of pork sausage) and cheese. I also got a side of the home-made baked beans. The pasty, as usual, was really good but the baked beans were gross - dry and just all the wrong flavours. I much prefer canned, I guess. They were either in the oven too long or had been sitting out... just not fresh.\nWhile the food (minus the beans) was good, the building was super hot. It was pretty crowded and we were sitting by the bar where all the ovens and things are, but they need to definitely invest in a better cooling system with more vents or something because it was almost unbearable - and it wasn't even in the triple digits outside yet. I can't imagine eating there in the middle of the summer! \nAlso, service was really spotty. What I presume was the owner (or at least a manager) came by a few times and we had our plates cleared but we were sitting on the end of the bar right in front of a girl making fillings and she didn't say a single word to us the whole time. I wanted some HP sauce and I couldn't get her attention since she didn't bother to look up once. I get that you're busy but you're still an employee and it's still part of your job to handle some customer service. Even a smile would have been nice, but was perhaps too much to expect from a restaurant that hires only 20-something hipsters and hippies (and I don't mean that insultingly, it's just facts). Perhaps I'm getting old in my young age.\nAlso, that HP sauce I wanted? They were out of because of \""supplier problems\"". You know they sell it at every Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and World Market, right? You don't need to import it yourself and if you're out of an English staple in an English restaurant, at least go out and buy a few bottles till your \""supplier problems\"" are handled. Just a suggestion.\nI'm sticking to the Tempe location in the future. You can't keep me away from my pasties so easily."
0,"I'm very picky when it comes to fast food Mexican.  It can be simple but it has to be good.  This place had very  matter of fact service.  The food was done in a quick time frame but it just wasn't that cheap or that good to bother going back to.  Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potato added to it.  The tortilla was delicious.  It smelled and tasted fresh made.  However it was a bit burned.  Then the beans were very average with thick shreds of cheddar cheese.  The potatoes were gross in my opinion.  They were very big chunks of breakfast style potatoes with lots and lots of pepper.  I am not a fan of pepper.  Also ordered the 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  My children did not care for the \""meat\"" in the middle.  The guacamole was a bit sour tasting.  I did like that the tacos were thickly rolled.  The outside was super crisp and the inside mushy.  That appealed to me....\n\nWe won't be back."
0,Terrible. This woman lost my dog after one day and I never found her. Now Im short a family member and the woman didnt offer to pay for the cost of the dog. We had to ask for the money and it took her almost a month to pay up. And obviously you can't put a price on a lost baby. I miss my dog terribly and I strongly reccomend thinking twice before giving this woman your pet.
1,"Rum jungle....\n\nDelicious...... if you plan on dinning into this joint make sure you order the Rodizio fire pit.  It is delectable and totally filling.  I enjoyed the sausage and the pork the best.  They came out with this corn on the cob covered in grated cheese, muy bien! \n\nThey also have a plethora of rum cocktails... go figure.  Careful if you order the Strokeano.... It will destroy you!"
1,"We went to Greasewood Flat after hearing good things about it from a few different people. It was a Friday night and the place was packed! For being (seemingly) in the middle of nowhere, I was surprised how many people were there, young and old. \n\nIf you're ordering food, you go up to the window to the right of the entrance. We had the bacon green chili burger, pulled pork and the cowboy beans. It was all tasty and fairly priced. They had live music, plenty of alcohol and several fire pits to keep people warm. Unfortunately, I've heard through the grapevine that Greasewood Flat is closing soon :( It's too bad we waited this long to try it, because I'm sure it would be a place we'd visit often."
1,"Great atmosphere, good food and very friendly staff. Local hangout. The Manager, mike is super nice and professional! Really enjoyed our breakfast here and we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!"
1,Fast great food. Amazing friendly staff. Delicious cookies! Will return and recommend.
1,I don't eat fish so I'm not sure how much my review is worth but on my first visit recently the chef made me the most wonderful veggie roll -he even did it without the seaweed which I hate!  Excellent!!!
1,This is a great little bar/lounge. I ordered a Aviator and hung out at a UYE event or could of been a CMYE event. It came in a Foo Foo Glass but i didnt feel weird drinking it. And it was quite delicious. The owner was behind the bar serving. GREAT. Little candles are lit and the stools are comfortable. Music is playing but its not over powering so you can still have a conversation. I think the prices are more Strip priced than Downtown priced but its all good. I shall be back.
0,"Please read this review. whoa ! there is no option for No STARS. I would have given that to this place. bad bad experience eating there once. We are North-Indians we know our food. The food was soo bland and not very professionally cooked, it was like some aunty trying to cook restaurant food. Very very small portions. \n\nBut here is the best part, when the bill arrived everything was marked at $1 extra $2 extra. I asked the server to please look at this bill everything is marked at a higher price, she came back and said no everything is alright . That is when I explained her everything like she was a Child, \""see the price in the menu now see the price on the bill can you see the difference\"", then she took the bill back and reduced some amount and still it was incorrect. All this while the owner lady was watching but decided not to get into it or even come to us to ask what was happening and if she could help us. At this point i was like are you kidding me, opening a restaurant and inflating prices from what you wrote in the menu... I went up to the counter i said, please look at the bill again it is STILL INACCURATE. The owner lady said, \""Relax, please don't stress\"". Now I was really calm, i thought \""Why would I be stressed, its your business, and your customer is upset, you are fooling them. You better be stressed\"" i was just watching her get really confused and not able to manage anything at all... then she gave me rest of the amount back in loose change. She kept on saying there is something wrong with the package here the software that calculates and generates the bill. \n\nWe had such a bad experience, we will never go back there again and told everyone we know about what happened, everyone who heard the story was furious.\nGet your ACT together Ma'am."
1,Yum. I just love the keg.\n\nFood is yummy\nService is fast\nServers are friendly\nPrices are decent\n\nWhat else can you ask for??
1,"I always bring my shoes here to get shined and they do a great job , most of the time they do it while I wait , or if they are busy they will usually get the shoes back the same day , on top of that they are very knowledgable and have great customer service ... I highly recommend this place for your shoe repair needs"
1,Normally not my kind of place. But they make everything you can dream of and it's usually pretty good. I'm not a fan of the decor. It feels like a high school gym with some embelishments. But the bathrooms were spotless and that's always important to me.
1,"So I recently got a job in the city of Mesa conveniently near T.C. And when I had to make a day trip to the joint (hardly a joint, more Scottsdale-esque) I was quickly floating on breakfast cloud 9.\n\nI love food, and I love to eat, and I LOVE a great breakfast brunch.  This place had it all!!! We went there after my graduation from college with a bunch of family, mostly of the elderly.  Let me first explain that going anywhere with my Grandpa is a mission in itself, nothing is ever cooked right and service is always too slow however he could not stop complimenting the staff on how great everything was (first time I have ever witnessed this in 22 years).  \n\nTC is a great place for family and celebrations or just to enjoy a great weekend brunch.  LET ME WARN YOU IF YOU GO ON A WEEKEND GO EARLY OR YOU WILL BE WAITING AROUND 30 minutes!"
0,"If I was in search of Mexican food, this would not be where I would go.  You are eating Mexican food in the middle of a casino next to the Carrot Top Theater- You just can't expect anything authentic.  \n\nWe only ended up at this restaurant as a stop between the Carrot Top show and the club downstairs.  It was about 11pm and we just needed food and didn't really care about quality.  \n\nThe prices are to be expected- a little higher than you would like.  We had a quesadilla and tacos, which are probably about the same quality as what you get at a Don Pablo's.  What I missed was free chips and salsa!  This is Mexican- they should come standard!\n\nAlso, our service totally stank!  We say at the bar so we could watch the TVs.  It wasn't very busy (being that it was 11pm).  The bartender only came over to us to take our order and then we had to flag her down to get our check.  She didn't check on us once throughout the meal.  \n\nSo, if you like Americanized Mexican, go for it.  Hope you have a better waitress than us."
0,"I came here because I was lured by the coupons on Restaurant.com, and lets just say I m glad I used that coupon. There is no way I would pay full price for the quality of food I was served and the price listed. I got 6 very thin buttermilk pancakes for $7. And a slice of ham costs like $5? I got a better deal eating at the signatures with an all american breakfast platter that costs $11.  \n\nIf you are coming here to find some great steals on mom and pop style off the strip hidden gems, and this is definitely the wrong place. Its over priced, and not worth the hype and drive. Go some where else like Egg & I or your local hotel."
1,"I love this place because they make aguas frescas or licuados from just about any kind of fruit you can think of. They are not made from powdered mixes - they cut up the fruit right there and blend it with water, sugar and ice. I love the agua de sandia (watermelon), melon (canteloupe) and mango.  The drinks taste just like the fruit. Just beware, they are big and you can get full just from drinking them while you are waiting for your food.  You can ask for your drink to come in a to-go cup if you want to take it with you even if you eat there. \n\nThe food is great! I love the tortas, quesadillas and tacos. I haven't found anywhere else that comes close to the taste and selection yet. \n\nYou can call ahead and then pickup your order also.\n\nI love salsa and bachata music and they often play this in the restaurant. They sell tickets to local cumbia concerts sometimes too.\nThis is a great place!\n\nNote: They were formerly called Tortas La Presa. I had gone to some of the other Torta La Presa locations and did not find the same food or drink selection and didn't know why. When I visited the 7th St location we asked and were told that due to a issue with the name and other places using the same name but being different, they had to change it."
1,"First, our server, A.J.,  was top notch and was a major reason for our group of golf buddies enjoying a great evening at CPH. He had knowledge of the food and great personality.  The cocktails and food were delicious.  The only negative comments I can say is that the crab cakes need a little work. But the chopped salad, the burrata, the short rib, the scallops, and the meatloaf were fantastic.\nGreat restaurant with lots of energy."
1,best grocery story in Arizona. All the food is high quality and very affordable. I think of it an AJ's Fine Foods at half the price. And the BLT with avocado and cheese for $3.50 is the best sandwich in Phoenix. I'd take over a steak or lobster no question.
1,"Sooooooooo there's a little bit of beer here. And by \""little bit\"" I mean a $#!% ton! I don't think I've ever seen so many different varieties under one roof, so much so it was near impossible to settle on the two brews that I grabbed... Moon Man and a New Glarus first for me, Enigma. They call it a sour, but I've had sourer (is that really a word?) It's tasty! Sweet almost cherry-like notes, but what do I know... I just started drinking beer yesterday. \n\nThe liquor aisles will take you days to navigate. Let me make it easy. Three Olives S'mores Vodka. It's all you need. It's best shaken with ice and strained, but you can do pretty much anything with it. We had some eager drinkers (read: drunk ass mo fos) over to the house who discovered that you can add anything right down to tonic and it'll probably still be delish. \n\nAs for foodstuffs, I can't say much because I haven't shopped those aisles. \n\nCarry cash, check or your debit though. Visa isn't everywhere you want to be."
1,"Great atmosphere, solid ambiance, excellent service, tasty drink selection and a dinner menu to die for.\n\nTry the Calabrese Piazzo, perfect spice, sweet chillies, three cheeses and spicy sausage."
0,"Oh gosh, nasty nasty nasty. This was another one of the bf's great idea. \""Oh, you planned the whole trip. I only have two requests - poutine and orange julep.\"" How could I turn him down?\n\nTraffic was horrendous and we were happy to finally arrive under the giant orange ball. It looked like it belongs in LA. It didn't look particularly clean but that didn't deter the bf.\n\nThe verdict? The orange julep was more watery than he expected and the burger looked worse than McDonald's. The fries were soaked in oil. Eww."
0,"If you don't mind or are used to being treated like you really don't matter or just another patient, this is certainly the place to go to.  I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but the woman in scrubs at check in this afternoon 10/21/2014  was very smug and  had a scowled look on her face.  I was going to use Dr. Stein to perform a preventive screening colonoscopy and was told I would not be meeting him until right  before the procedure.  Seems to me that if you are going into the doctors office to set up the procedure and paying the specialist insurance copay you would at least meet the doctor before.  I really felt like they cared less about me personally and also my business.  Guess they have enough business looking at the parking lot and waiting room.  I decided not to use them and opted to use someone a little more personable and caring.  This place looks like it is run like a production line, herd em in and herd em out."

As much as I don't like writing reviews for chains, this one is an exception.   \n\nEarl of Sandwich has brought me back from the brink after getting the drunken hangover shakes.  Conveniently located on the floor of Planet Hollywood, EoS serves Quiznos type of sandwiches, only wayyyyy better.  He's good for pregaming before a 12 hour rager.  I've had two types of sandwiches here. \n\nThe Caprese is your standard mozzarella, tomato sandwich with balsamic reduction. The Hawaiian is also your standard chicken, ham, cheddar and BBQ sauce.  \n\nTheir broccoli soup is chunky good, and their cookie will give you diabetes.  Earl Earl mm mm good"
1,"Was amazingly surprised. The seating was tight but for our party of 6 including CrossFit Athlete Cheryl Brost and her Husband Troy this was a great Dinner.\nTwo words: Bacon Jam. WOW WOW  WOW - The Deviled Eggs were excellent as well\nThe Beer selection was too different for my standard, Pyrate or Duval but they were fun to explore new labels I never heard of. The Design of the place is amazing and we all polished our plates with 100% satisfaction - Leave room for dessert cause Kerry Simons Carson Kitchen will leave an impression on your appetite and Heart.

Its not worth it."
1,"I thought that Le Peep's was very good.  I liked how it was not such a big place, but the right size.  I had ordered the Desperado skillet and really enjoyed it.  It was a pretty big size that I wasn't expecting so much!  I had to bring some of it home.  It was still tasty when I ate it later.  I do recommend this place."

This was the first shop I went to when i started gown hunting and went in with my idea of what I wanted my gown to look like.  Tisha put me in exactly what I had initially asked for and I soon realized that my vision was very boring and did nothing for my figure. I asked her to get me gowns that she think would fit my figure and came back with options I never would think I could get away with!! I almost purchased a gown here, but found a better gown elsewhere.  I wanted to still review this place because Tisha was great."
1,The smoked pork hock was huge that I could barely finish it.  Also tried the pig tails in which the fat literally melts in your mouth. The dishes were leaning on the salty side but still tasty. Service was alright.

0,I am not a fan of this place.  I went and sat at the bar - and was not assisted until I asked THREE times if I could get a drink.  Finally I did get one - and the bartender was puzzled when I asked if they had sake.  I had to kind of explain what a sake bomber was.  I was bummed out when they told me that they don't carry the larger sized beer bottles.  They finally brought me a thing of sake that was not in the traditional sake bottle or glass.   A Japanese person would be very insulted by this.  As for the food - I am not sure because I didn't have any.  I might give this place a second chance but not very likely.
1,"Work related event and bringing the family. Two games of bowling and food, good people and family.\nThis place is good to go bowling during the week close to home not crowded. \nWe had food delivered from TGIF's it was pretty good the only down fall was they did not bring enough plates and they forgot the ranch for the salad and the chicken.\nAll was good played 3 games and had a good night."

1,"I had an unexpectedly lengthy layover at the Charlotte airport during my recent venture to the midwest, and discovered there was a Bojangles just down the corridor from my connecting flight.  I wasn't too hungry, but I couldn't pass on the chance to sample some of the \""famous chicken & biscuit,\"" as the signs proclaimed.\n\nI opted for the chicken tenders, or \""supremes\"" as Bojangles named them, along with a biscuit.  The chicken was excellent.  The breading was crispier than I'd imagined, and gave it a nice crunch.  The chicken was juicy.  The biscuit was good, but definitely not the best ever (that spot is reserved for Popeye's).\n\nBojangles is definitely a worthy stop for a meal or even a snack if you find yourself at the Charlotte airport with an appetite and little bit of time."
1,"This was one of those times where I walked out, defiantly, thinking I WILL NOT BE JUDGED. Yet later on, when the SR asked me, where was mine? I had to hang my head in shame. For I, yer honour, I did walk past, and it was like a magnet pulling me in, for I did indeed see me some delightful looking almond croissants. \n\nLet me take you back to a time when once I feasted on almond croissants, in the balmy summer of the South of France. I've never tasted anything like those croissants in all my days since I left that town, not that I have ever stopped trying. Every one I have tried has paled in comparison, dry, dusty, overly sweet, not butterly melt in the almondy mouth. I'm not going to lie - The Wee Boulangerie didn't succeed either, but it gave it a damn good try. Where most almond croissants are almond paste basted in the heart of a pastry fold, and carry the body of a normal looking croissant, The Wee Boulangerie was like a Picasso impression, with crispy almond sponge oozing out everywhere. It didn't even really look like a croissant. But it tasted light, not dry, not too sweet, and the crispy light edges made a delightful contrast to the heaviness of the croissant itself. I enjoyed every, single, mouthful. \n\nA note as well - I'm on a diet. Almond croissants are pretty much verboten. The SR is on a diet. He is sick with jealousy at my hedonism... I'm going to have to get more to appease him. Thanks The Wee Boulangerie, you destroyed my diet, but in oh so such a beautiful way...."
1,"Lots to do, some of it touristy some of it just plain fun.\n\nBest thing besides just walking around and people watching was  the paddleboats at the basin bonsecours.  We went in the evening towards sunset and it was just a peaceful and fun way to watch all the activity of the port and still relax and be on the water.\n\nGreat for couples or even families with kids, lifejackets available but not mandatory.  about $17 canadian gets you 30 minutes, but they didn't really enforce it so you don't have to watch the clock."
1,I love Fat Sandwich!  The idea that everything is a topping is a great one so I can get whatever I want and it isn't too expensive. \n\nI loved the Fat Blue and the Fat Cowboy.  if you order a side of fries expect to get about 4 potatoes worth. \n\nYou can also order beer and cigars/cigarettes with your food and they even have a 2 sandwich 6 pack of beer special called the drunken three-way which is a great deal.\n\nbring change for parking though as this establishment is located in the campus town area and you have to pay for everything there.  like they don't gouge the students enough with tuition.
0,"My previous post did not show on the list so here it is again:\n\nWorst hotel ever! \n\nIf you believe in showing up to your hotel room with your bed not made and no toiletries in the room...book this place right away. There are only two elevators in the hotel that the hotel employees and guests share which makes getting to your floor anywhere from 5-15 min. Almost every day was a rude awakening when my room keys reset and would not let me in my room. This would not have been such a big issue except for the time that it took to get the elevator to show up to my floor and then return to my floor. \n\nOut of a week of staying in this hotel, my room was only cleaned twice and that was when I requested this. The cleaners do not speak a word of English which I guess is good if you would like to practice learning another language. I fortunately spoke Spanish but it was embarrassing for me to stumble through a conversation with the cleaners when I just needed a box of tissues and some toilet paper.\n\nThe elegant look of the hotel is summed up in one word...IKEA. Everything is cheaply decorated so you can bask in opulent trash while waiting for your elevator to show up.\n\nThe staff is very pleasant and does make you feel welcome. That is the only good thing about the place. Parking is $22 a day which is a total waste of money and the hotel bill was double charged for several days of parking.\n\nIn closing, I would not wish this hotel on my worst enemy."
0,"Stopped in for a bite while out running errands. We were confused because the guy inside was already putting chairs up on the tables and it was only 7ish (they close at 10). There were only two people ahead of us and it was taking forever! I was literally a second from walking out when Eric finally decided to help us. I got the 6\"" sweet onion chicken teriyaki on Italian bread with Swiss cheese. I didn't feel like toasted bread, so he just heated up the chicken for me. These guys were so slow making sandwiches... After paying and getting our drinks, we sat down at one of the high top tables, since all the other chairs were up. Right when we started to eat, the two employees went outside to smoke, leaving the store completely unattended. We were amazed. The chicken in my sub was not the best quality and I had to spit out some inedible pieces. Also there was a static-y speaker playing Jingle Bell Rock cutting in and out. Very annoying. We were finished eating by the time the two employees came back in from their smoke break. So irresponsible. Then they proceeded to empty all three tea dispensers like they were getting ready to close up shop. It was only 7:30! I bet they were planning to close the store early. These guys ought to be fired."
1,"[A version of this review will also be featured on the Holy Taco Church at http://www.holytacochurch.com/.]\n\nGadzooks! Enchiladas and Soup is a new place that I keep seeing mentioned on all the best-foods-in-Phoenix type lists.\n\nI ordered two tacos. My husband ordered enchiladas. I chose the \""50/50,\"" meaning half flour and half corn tortillas--this ended up being a good choice, because my husband went with corn and found they became extra toasty in the oven. \n\nNext up... MEAT. I was a bit confused about if I could combine meat with another non-meat main item, and it turned out I could.\n\nI chose to do two chicken and cornbread tacos. Cornbread. YES. Scooped out of a big casserole pan. Yelp said it was delicious, so I wanted to give it a shot!\n\nWith my tacos girded with chicken and chunks of cornbread, my food moved on down the food bar. Me, I love me some cheese, and here I asked for asadero and chihuahua cheese. My whole dish was stuck in the big oven to heat up for like two minutes as I waited and drooled. Next up, I asked for pico, crumbled cojita cheese (because cheeeeeeeese), vinaigrette slaw, and pickled onions. At this point, the dish looked like a delicious rainbow of awesomeness.\n\nI asked for a pumpkin cookie and was pleased that the order included two. BONUS COOKIE FTW. They also had lemon blueberry cookies and I'd love to try those sometime.\n\nSo, cornbread on a taco. Dude. This is amazing. Cornbread tastes awesome but it also has this soft/crunchy texture thing going on. It melds with the meat. Clouds opened up. Angels sang. Cornbread is good with everything on a Thanksgiving plate, and it totally works with zingy Mexican flavors. I need to try this combo at home.\n\nThe food was 100% awesome. Every topping I chose was fabulous. The slaw and onions added a tang and crunch that nicely complemented the holy fusion of cornbread and chicken.\n\nMy husband had a short rib and a pork enchilada. He was pleased. I asked for bites of his food to judge this. Well, it was more like a mugging. My fork loomed over his plate and he wisely surrendered the dish before I stabbed him. I agreed with his assessment.\n\nMeanwhile, our son had tortilla chips. They are awesome, all covered with bubbles, and thick enough that they can crackle and kinda explode when you bite into them. You could tell they are made there.\n\nThen we come to the cookies. The glaze on them turned out to be maple. MAPLE! Happiness! Rainbows! Fuzzy kittens! The cookies really tasted like homemade and were soft and chewy.\n\nWe loved Gadzooks. Awesome food with great options. Good prices ($6.95 to get two tacos or two enchiladas). It's earned all the buzz."
1,"I have never had a bad experience with any Discount Tire location I have done business with but this store (AZP-24) on Elliot and Priest sets a new standard for customer service. I had scheduled an appointment for this morning for 8 AM and when I arrived I was greeted promptly by Scott. Scott was very attentive and made sure to have a complete understanding of my concerns with a problem I have been having with a tire on my wife's car. After listening to me, he gave me a very clear plan that he was going to use to address my concerns. The work was done in a very efficient manner and I was on my way in just over an hour. I will have to see if the fix took care of the problem but at this point, I am very satisfied with Discount Tire and especially Store Manager Darren's team at AZP-24."
0,"I used to like this place, and now I HATE this place! I would rather be starved instead of going back!\n\nI came here a year ago and the experience was good. This year I came again and it's totally worse than last year. The service was lacking. First of all, we made a reservation through Open Table, and we were very sure it's made because at first, the hostess was able to see it and be able to say my husband's name correctly. So after we got seated down, we notice that the points weren't added to our open table account yet, so my husband asked the hostess about it to see if they have checked us in. But then at that point the hostess said he didn't make any reservation, I guess they deleted it after we got seated, as we couldn't even see the record on our open table account either. The record was there before we got seated, and then disappeared after we were seated. So we didn't get to have out points on open table and it's definitely their fault, not ours.\nAt the end, when we got our check, we forgot to show them the Total Reward card to get the 10% discount, and my credit card has been swiped but I haven't signed yet. So we asked if they can redo the bill for us. They said no because the credit card has been swiped. I got too upset that i didn't argue with them and just paid them and decided not going back. I know that it's not final as long as I don't sign the receipt, they could have voided the one that I haven't signed, and redo the bill with my total reward discount. I know other restaurants would do that as that happened to me in the past. They just needed to void the charge on my card especially I haven't signed. I still give them 15% tip at the end though I am totally dissatisfied with their laziness and wrong doing (including messing up our open table reservation). They don't deserve tip but I gave 15% anyway, as this is the last time they would see me setting foot at this particular restaurant.\n\nI want to note that the service at the one in Town Square is way way way better than this one in Paris Hotel. The Town Square doesn't offer Total Reward discount (of course as it's not in the casino) but their price is lower than the one in paris hotel. Unless you really really really want to look at Bellagio Fountain while eating, otherwise, there is no point to eat at this one at Paris Hotel. You don't really see much of the Bellagio Fountain anyway if you are not sitting at the outside patio.\n\nI am not going back to this Sugar Factory in Paris Hotel ever again. I think it's either the employees lacking training, or the management of this particular one is not doing their job well in training their staff, or maybe the management didn't treat the employees well making them staff not doing their job well. \n\nIf you want to ask me about the food, the food is better at the one in Town Square as well. I always like their red velvet sundae but this time they have changed it to something that tasted so nasty in SF Paris Hotel. While the red velvet sundae at the one in Town Square is still good. I visited both within the same week, so the comparison is a fair one. And yes, I had red velvet sundae twice within the same week but at different location. The one in Town Square is much better than the one in paris hotel!!!!!! At the one in Town Square, the server and hostess are way better, they didn't mess up our open table reservation, greeted us nicely, always have smiley face. The staff (including the management, not just the staff on the floor) at SF Sugar Factory requires a lot of improvement."
0,"So now that I am the second one to review the Cinco De Mayo Massacre I will sail away in the boat of Asshole with Matthew C. I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.  \n\nMy night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila. \n\nNext Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other \""Hot and Spicy\"" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno. \n\nSo by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said,\"" he did not get his food\"" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!\n\nYes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse. \n\nI will not be back to this location... Esto era horrible y nunca voy a estar de vuelta"
0,"I was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night. It was a $5 cover to hear the house band, which was no biggy and then I asked for a diet coke which was another $3. Again, no problem paying for the diet coke. After about 30 minutes and some dancing, I went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free. The bartender told me it would be another $3. I mentioned that I was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that I thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible. Well that got me nowhere so I asked for a glass of water instead. I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.\n\nNow it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really? I don't mind paying the cover and the cost of the first diet coke, Im not being cheap but the point is that most bars appreciate and take care of the designated driver. I was being responsible and they couldn't even give me a glass of water!\n\nReally?"
0,"The food at this place makes cardboard taste like fine dining. Fantastic service, crappy \""Mexican\"" food. That being said, the first couple of bites were phenomenal - and really only because we went here after one of the EDC nights. Basically, we got back to our rooms at the Hard Rock around 7am...I showered/cleaned up, because there's just no way I can bring myself to sleep without taking a shower after EDC, then we all woke up around 10, cleaned up, checked out, then headed to Pink Tacos around 12:30. The last meal I'd had was breakfast...the previous day (don't judge! who has time to eat or sleep in Vegas anyways??!!?!)."
0,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I decided to spend my money here. I spent 54.99 on getting my car washed and cleaned inside and out. There was still stuff on my floor boards, they didn't even clean the dash or anything else inside the car. They didn't wash the rims, I still had dirt under my spoiler. 54 bucks wasted!! I could have done 10 times a better job by myself than all 5 of them that did it!"
0,Do not come here this is the worst restaurant i ever been. Food quality and customer service are both below average.
0,"Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \""garlic\"" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend."
1,"Excellent service...everything is homemade...the prickly pear cream soda was our favorite. I had the mandrew sandwich buffalo style, it was excellent. Wife had the turkey pickle Brie and loved it. Well definitely be back and the happy hour seems like a great deal so well come back for that. Overall cool experience, they make their own soda if you haven't seen...which can be taken home in growlers...and they do a ton of really unique floats if you're only looking for a snack."
1,"My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for just a few nights but I knew I wanted to come here when I saw the Candy Corn Martini featured on the Todd English P.U.B. Facebook page. We were staying way off the strip for a conference but I called and spoke with a friendly and helpful hostess named Shahia (I know I just jacked up the spelling of her name! Sorry!) She was so sweet telling us the best way to find the place since we were taking the monorail! When we made it, we greeted each other like old friends! I loved that!\n\nWe sat outside so my boyfriend could see a bit  of the World Series on the outdoor TV. We had Corey as our sever, he was just as friendly and fabulous as Shahia! We started with martini's (my one Candy Corn martini was enough...it was VERY SWEET but so festive!) We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tar Tare as a starter...This was so delish! I highly recommend it! I had Steak Tacos and my BF had the Sheperd's Pie which was also very very good! \n\nWe had a great time and a great dinner. Maybe too many Strongbow Ciders and Fireball, but hell...we were in Vegas! We really enjoyed our last evening there and the service Corey and Shahia provided was great! We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas! \n\nI highly recommend anyone else to visit Todd English P.U.B. also, you will not be disappointed! Thanks!!"
0,"Understaffed, slow service, coupled with a dirty interior. The trash had been overflowing for at least 20 minutes. The store is far too small for the location."
1,"****** 4.5 stars *****\n\nOne of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \""great\"" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \""upscale Southern\"" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!"
0,I ask for a soda water with a lemon and got  it with a lime. Ask to have my steak medium and it was under cooked...medium rare. I expected better service and better food for the money. They recooked my sirloin....didn't give me a new one. I ordered sirloin oscar so the bernaise  sauce was not replace thus the dish was ruined. I will not be back and wish I would have gone to Longhorn Steakhouse.
0,"Both times I have taken the Amtrak back and forth between Champaign and Chicago I have been late on both legs of the round trip. The delays have ranged from 1 hour to 3 hours. It should NOT take 5 hours to get from Champaign to Chicago on a train. \n\nUnfortunately as one of those pesky Chicago dwellers who does not own (nor plan on buying) a car, this is pretty much my only way for me to attend U of I football games. Well, I guess I could rent a car for the weekend, but that would be around $100+, whereas Amtrak is $13 each way if you book far enough in advance. As long as the football game is at 2 PM or later, you should make it, since the train is supposed to arrive in Champaign at 10:45 AM. But if you have an 11:00 or noon game, do NOT expect Amtrak to get you there by kickoff (or even halftime in some cases)."
1,"This place is a godsend for someone on The Strip looking for some craft beer, or just beer with taste that doesn't have \""Bud\"" or \""Lite\"" in the name. Sorry, getting a little judgmental.\n\nSpeaking of, when seated at a table for four (was surprised they sacrificed one for just me, a walk-in) I was provided an iPad which contained all the menus for all the beer. I didn't see anyone else with an iPad though, which I thought was peculiar. Frustration kicked in when I tried to order two beers and they were out of both. Why not have the menus update this information? Regardless, the \""beer cicerone\"" was able to help me pick something comparable. They have many canned beers, which they take pride in. So what did I do? Ordered canned beer. Why not-it's Vegas.\n\nHad the Poutine for the appetizer (which was enough for one person's entree): thin, seasoned fries with duck confit, thick cheese curds, a sunny side egg and a gravy that the waiter poured on the dishin person at the table. He even asked me if I was ready (which spooked me a little-uh, ready for what?) This, my friends, was THE. BEST. POUTINE. Everything was perfect, especially that spooky gravy. It's also hard to find poutine stateside that has quality cheese curds.\n\nEntree was their version of Chicken (Quail) and Waffles: buttermilk fried quail and waffles served with greens with lemongrass butter and Moose Drool (a brown ale from Montana) syrup. It was ...good, but not great. I think I was just wanting fried chicken and waffles and not have to fight with quail bones (no fault of theirs.)\n\nFor my (and your) finale was a Chocolate Stout Layer Cake with Malted milk ice cream and, AND, caramelized bacon rice crispies. To be honest, the only, ONLY, reason I got this? To see what bacon crispies tasted like. I was already full of food and beer. I knew the chocolate cake was going to be rich and decadent and yes, the crispies did indeed taste like bacon.\n\nI waddled back to Caesar's a happy man."
1,"I went to Vivido Gelato over the weekend, and it was my first time having gelato since I was in Italy a couple of years ago.  I got a small cup of the swiss chocolate and my friend got a small cup of the tiramisu gelato.  \n\nOne reviewer who posted back in May 2010 said that a small cup of gelato cost $4.55.  Either Vivido has lowered their prices since then, or that review was misleading.  \n\nThe small cups are $3.55 each, and the mediums are $4.55, and the small serving is quite sufficient for a normal human being.  As far as I'm concerned, anyone who consumes a medium or large serving in one sitting is committing the sin of gluttony.  It's an ugly sin, and nothing to gloat about.\n\nWe decided to sit and enjoy our gelato in the small lobby, while the two other parties of customers took theirs to go.  Although I cannot say it was the best gelato I've ever tasted, I thought it was very delicious and worth coming for.  \n\nWhen the party with children left, our server came out from behind the counter with a bottle of Windex and wiped the fresh hand smudges from the window glass in front of the gelato.  Then the manager came over to our table to make sure we were happy and satisfied.  \n\nLocated in the Boca Park shopping center, Vivido has a lot going for it.  It has a large selection of flavors, several size options, including by the pint or quart if you want to take some home with you.  It also serves coffee, although I didn't try any.  The service was friendly, the prices not unreasonable, and the establishment is very well maintained.  The employees are meticulous about keeping the window glass clean and smudge-free, and the chairs, tables and floors spotless. \n\nI will definitely be back to try other flavors and maybe some of their coffee."
0,"I used to think Mojo was fine until I began yogurt-quest 2010 with my boyfriend. Now that I've tried a lot of other places, Mojo has gone to the bottom of my list. They do have a variety of flavors, but the yogurt taste and texture just doesn't quite do it for me. Something is slightly off. Mojo is doing something right with their branding because they do get quite a following. The crowds at Mojo are yet another reason for me to patronize other smaller places: shorter lines and places to sit."
0,"I'm always devastated when I have to fly out of the B  gates because I know that this is the only place you can go to get a drink.  The smell of the bar is vomit-inducing; it reminds me of a cheap college bar where they play Lil Wayne and coeds grind on each other while spilling beer all over the slippery floor.  I can't imagine what Jon Taffer from Bar Rescue would find at the bottom of the ice bin here, but I guarantee you it would be disgusting and rhyme with \""old\"".  Hungry?  Get ready to enjoy some cellophane wrapped sandwiches that make the selection at Circle K look like gourmet fare.  Do yourself a favor and starve yourself until you get to your next destination. And if you're craving a buzz, bring a bunch of mini shots in your bag and suck em down while playing the slots."
1,Great food! Best wings in town. Ohio State football? This is the place to be to watch the game.
0,"never again !! Sat. morning took my daughter to breakfast there. she had 2 breakfast burritos &.a hash brown. We sat down inside\nthe second burrito had a bug on it the kind with the pincher at the end so I took it to the cashier asked for the manager I show it to him with a confused look. he then showed it to i'm assuming she was the owner plain clothes behind the counter Asian lady. listen to this excuse it blew my mind she said that it must have flown on the burrito I told her there is no wings,then she says it can't be from us because everything is brought in frozen and if it was from them the bug would be dead! Really!"
1,"I have to say that this is my favorite chinese restaurant and probably a very underappreciated one.  This place is definitely a bit of a hole in the wall- outdated on the inside, not so great decor.  The staff, however is very friendly and I have always enjoyed everything I order here.  The restaurant is quiet and relaxing and they have some fun drinks to order from the bar.  I especially appreciate the Scorpian Bowl for Two...which comes out flaming.  The prices are good too and they deliver."

0,"Worst ever! I typically like these restaurants but this one is horrible.  Waited forever for our food and had to ask for one item since it was forgotten in the steamer. Then we were rewarded with it being slammed into a basket and shoved at us by a sneering girl who worked at a snail's pace. The chips were stale and the entire seating area a filthy mess. They weren't busy, so there's no excuse for any of this."
1,Wow! What a great place! Picked Grapevine for the upper deck on a cool day. Get the lohvosh Cajun chic with onions!!!! Holy crap!
1,"Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was incredible. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1."
0,"BUMMER ?\nI had high hopes for this place. I actually drove by once a week to check on the construction progress before they opened. Perfect location, craft beer, outside seating, old red brick building atmosphere! I was stoked! \n\nLong story short: I have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good. And what is with those baby diarrhea green walls and chairs, talk about a 100 year old red brick wall buzz kill. Service is really slow and blah. It is like they hire just anybody and then turn them loose without any training. \n\nI may try them again in a year or two. I am really bummed...this place had a lot of potential."
0,"I don't think I've ever felt more ripped off in my life.\n\nI think it's one of the worse buffet and brunch I've ever had. Even the cheap buffet inside Harrah's is better than this (at least they have waffle cones!)\n\nEven if I'm a whale of a gambler and get comp'd for this, I would have to think twice before stepping in.\n\nAmbience: poor. flickering fluorescent light in one of the area\nSeafood: meh. all the other hotel buffets are so much better/fresher. friend got sick after\nHot food: meh again. \nDessert: small selection and C quality compared to all the other buffets (Wynn, Belagio, etc)\n\ni have no clue why anyone would go here when there's Wynn all those yummy buffets at half the price. The people who gave this place 4 or 5 stars seriously are not foodie's and must NOT have had the good buffets in vegas (or even just a nice brunch at Bouchon at Venetian!) \n\nI have to admit, while other buffets are all similar in a good way and blur together in my head, this one was extra memorable because it was so bad.\n\n(note: I was dragged here not by choice)"
1,"I love there iced coffees! ive never eaten the food, but i hear the sandwiches arent bad"
0,"Ok so I'll start by saying I used to work for JM at other locations (FL,NV). For the longest time I wouldn't go near another franchise (Subway, Quiznos, etc). Lately however, I find the prices at JM to be rediculous for some of their sandwiches. $10 for a giant?! Seriously? They used to be 8 bucks. For someone like me who gets their philly steak with just cheese and onions it makes for a pretty measly sandwich. We used to throw in a little extra meat if someone didn't want any other toppings otherwise the meat gets lost in the bread.\n\nThis location is by far the worst I have ever been to. The employees at McDonalds and Taco Bell have a higher IQ and a better attitude. Ordered a philly steak with just onions. How easy is that? Not easy enough I guess. Luckily I was watching and noticed her throw on peppers instead of onions. I would understand if it was a busy day and there was a line of people with lots of orders how it can get mixed up but the store was empty and I was the only person there. There were other employees hanging out on one side of the store talking loudly with either friends or co-workers cursing, making out, etc.\n\nOne of the girls even mentioned loudly how she had to go pick up her mom from prison bc she just got released. (lol)\n\nAnyway- the food is still good quality but make sure if you are going to go to any JM find a coupon first. Lots of BOGO coupons and stuff out there. Def worth it if you get a BOGO."
1,"There may be new owners but they still retain their most excellent chef. \n\n- Don't be a puss and ask the chef for his recommendations.\n- You must try the lemon roll, volcano roll and sashimi salad."
0,"I really wanted to like Jim's since it's close to home and we could use a good diner out here. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. My boyfriend and I just ordered standard breakfast-- I had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and we split hashbrowns. The pancakes were undercooked, the bacon was so overcooked it was basically inedible, and the hashbrowns were also too crispy. It was not a cheap breakfast by any means and the girl who brought us our food didn't even say one word to us. I've heard other people say they enjoyed their food but just from that one bad experience, I have to say I will not go back, no matter how close it is."
0,"Only stay here if you get the room for FREE!\nWe stayed (and paid what we thought was a good rate for the center of the strip) 7/21-7/24, could not have been a worse stay.  Like many people have said previously, the auto entrance to PH is not from the strip, you enter from Harmon Ave, then you have to pick between the Valet at the check-in area or Self Park which is way far from the check-in (you trapes through the Mircle Mile Mall to get to the front desk.  Its very confusining. A quick note on the Valet...they lost our car one time, found it after 30 minutes, later they were rude when I asked if my car had been brought up yet...\""yes, I called out your name and you did not answer\""...the car was pulled up far away from the valet area.\n\nOk, now for the room experience...we checked in between 3-4 pm and received the keys to our standard room, got up to the 32nd floor...the room is small looked old and not kept up.  First thing we noticed was that there is VERY LITTLE drawer and closet space...then we noticed that the Armoire had two doors RIPPED OFF.  We went down to the front desk and reported the condition and asked for a new room.  We got the keys to the new room, 20th floor...actually a worse room!  The only thing better was this was a View room of the Bellagio fountains.  Still small, the armoire had the doors, but still very little space to unpack.  Here is where it get's worse, the view would have been fine if the shades on the window would work, they were down and would not go up.  They were very old and frayed.  Called maintaince, we also needed them to replace the shower head (it was old and corrded) and clear the bathroom drain (it was very slow).  Then later in the stay the old phone in the room died and we had to get maintaince again!\n\nThe Hotel lay out is horrible, I am used to casino's being hard to figure out and get through (till you get used to them), but with mall being part of it, makes it worse.  Actually what really makes it bad is that they give you a \""map\"" to the property that is probably the WORST HOTEL MAP I have ever seen.  It covers the bottom 3 floors of the hotel, lobby, casino and mezzanine.  What made the map so bad was that all 3 floors were placed on the map facing a different direction...THEY DO NOT RELATE TO EACH OTHER!  There is no compass (North) direction for you to reference!  Also they do not give directions to the pool (on the 6th floor roof) I will talk about that later.\n\nWe went down on Sunday to speak to a manager about the problems we had and the (top) manager on duty (Rodrigo?) was worthless, he offered us $25 credit at the property for our bother.  When we asked him about the Surf show playing at the hotel, he had no idea what we were talking about, much less to be able to get us a discount on tickets.  We had to go to \""Tix4Tonight\"" to get 1/2 off the tickets to the show Monday night (it was a good show, but less than half full!).  \n\nThe pool's are smallish, one for family's the other for adults, with very little space around each pool to lay out (unless you pay $50+ for a bed or cabana).  There is a huge lounge area away from the pools, but you are away from the pool,  it is dirty and old.\n\nI guess if you are a single 21-25 year old, this would be an acceptable place to stay on the strip, but otherwise pass (especially if you are in the late 40 to early 50 range)."
1,"Decent sandwiches, and a great price for the area. In kind of a run down strip mall though."
1,"From lemon drop to IPA, this place is the real deal!"
0,"Underwhelmed\nPlain and boring interior, Snooty waiters at the bar and pizzeria, staff is short and slightly rude. Pizza is good but not the best, definitely not worth waiting hours for. Overall lack luster. Will I be back? Probably not. Will I recommend to friends and out of town guests? Probably not. I can go to La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale for brick oven pizza that is much better, less wait time,  more options on their menu and genuine friendly service."
1,Awesome stock! Friendly and knowledgable staff! One stop shopping for all of your zombie needs!
0,"Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a \""signature\"" cocktail and it tastes like garbage. \n\nIn this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass. \n\nSo you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space. \n\nAll in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer.. \n\n\nI left after the drink. You got me at \""hello?\"" No, not so much."
1,"Very good food! Our table ordered hotdogs, hamburgers, and fries (plain fries, cheese, and chili-cheese fries). The service was quick, the owner came to the table and was super friendly (definitely not annoying) - they made it clear that they were grateful for our visit!! Great place!!"
1,Planned a weekend getaway for myself and found this gem at the last minute. It is hidden away from the rest of lake las vegas but worth the drive. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. When I went down for some drinks they had a great view at the back of the hotel with firepits everywhere. Best weekend getaway ever. Will definitely come back again
0,We used Sin City Smokers for our company bar b que picnic.  It was delicious.  They brought so much food  we got to eat sumptously twice.   Highly recommended.
1,"I'm pretty happy that a place exists where carnivores like me get to share the table with vegan or vegetarian friends and EVERYONE enjoys their meals.\n\nTom Yum soup was very tasty! Ordered the soup \""medium\"" on the spicy level but it was pretty hot for me. Still amazing, ate the whole bowl. Fresh vegetables, and it seems like the longer it sits the spicier it gets.\n\nWe also ordered a combination chow fun dish with chinese broccoli. I was pretty happy with this dish, especially because it's something I have had a Chinese take out version of that was always sort of greasy. This was not the case at Komol. The broccoli was very green and fresh, the noodles were well cooked and not overly saucy. \n\nThe other half of the table ordered the chicken curry, and vegan pad thai to rave reviews. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you are looking for a good thai spot, especially one with a very pretty interior and excellent service.\n\nIt is an absolute MUST if you are vegan/vegetarian. Don't miss this one!"
1,"It was the best cirque show I've ever seen.  I'm a huge MJ fan and it was incredible.  The theater, amazing.  The sound, awesome.  The visuals, inspiring.  I would see it again in a heartbeat."
1,Great food and nice service!! Really recommended if you like Asian food. Tried wok noodle with chicken and bean sauce and it was simply delicious. Open until late so it's a good choice for a late night dinner.
0,"Our last night in Vegas, out group of 10 needed to kill time before our red-eye flight so since we were already in New York New York gambling we decided to eat here (located right by the casino). The restaurant is huge and there is a giant map of the US on the ceiling with all of the famous things about each state.\n\nI got the salon entree with the spicy BBQ sauce on the side (I do not like BBQ sauce) and I gave that sauce to the boys which they loved and used it on their hash brown and steaks. The salmon was small and not the best tasting but the veggies that came with my plate was excellent! I even substitute my mashed potato's for them but the waitress forgot then realized it and brought me a side of veggies. The bf got the spaghetti and he didn't like it and had better. For both our entrees it cost us about $36...kind of pricey for okay food. Everyone else thought their food was okay but they did say that the jambalaya was spicy and delicious."
0,"Great location, rooms need TLC.\n\nThe Good: The Quad is located in the center of the strip, across from Caesars Palace and between Harrah's and Flamingo. It shares a Monorail stop with Harrah's. It's also had a recent full exterior makeover, and added The Linq -- a pedestrian-only alley with shops, restaurants, and a 550-foot Ferris Wheel. Our check-in receptionist was very professional and courteous. Great blackout curtains. Blankets and pillows were comfy.\n\nThe Bad: Getting to the parking structure requires going over The World's Most Horrific Speedbumps. I actually cracked my undercarriage exhaust on these. Go SLOWLY over these lest you want your fillings displaced. Parked, walked into hotel, was instantly accosted by the annoying \""HEY YOU GUYS JUST GET INTO TOWN HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A SHOW\"" people. We tried to politely decline, but these people wouldn't let it go, and we finally had to snap that we weren't interested in whatever they were selling. It looks like they renovated the major gaming area, but most ancillary areas are old and dusty and probably have been since the 80's.\n\nThe Ugly: Every time you walk off the elevator to the hotel room floors, we are assaulted with the stench of stale cigarette smoke. Step into the room, and get hit with a wall of musty, damp, muggy air. I suppose you get get used to it after a while. Shower head has little water pressure. Mattress has big dips in it. Carpet is stained and dirty. Sink barely drains. I imagine this room was nice when it was new, but everything now looks battered and dirty.\n\nGreat location, but remember you get what your pay for when it comes to room quality."
0,Don't use az best tires in mesa you will regret it !!!! I had purchased two used tires from them  in may 2013 and brought my vehicle back to them with the wheel shaking and they  replaced one of the tires which had a bubble on it but not the other one . Well 11 days later the other tire deshreaded on the 60frwy and ripped off my front fender and bumper and tore apart the bottom of the drivers side door . When i made them aware of it and went  to  them to pay for repairs due to what their product (tires ) did to my vehicle they refused . They are not honorable business people and will not take of you like a honorable business does  . They are not worth doing business with !!!!!!
0,"Came here last Saturday after the Color Run. There was no line and now I know why. The food was awful, the portions were small, and the employees were talking about the customers in Spanish (I know because I'm fluent)! I'd give this place negative stars if I could. Needless to say, I will NOT be back."
1,"Items sold in Artisanal Foods are pretty unique. We bought a bottle of yuzu juice (made in Miyazaki, Japan), some small stuff and even Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' potato chips, ha! The guy running the shop let us sample many of items and it helped us to decide what we would buy.\n\nNot cheap but worth a visit if you're into quality foods."
0,"Don't go here! Overpriced, overrated, and bad service. \n\nEnvironment:\nI thought the cafe would be a nice dining experience overlooking the pools, but the tables are so close you might as well have a convo with your neighbor. Noisy! We had Debbie Downer for our waitress who never smiled and saw her only three times: once to take our order, another time to deliver food, and a final time to deliver the check. Um, can we get refills? She even messed up on the drink order: coffee. How do you forget coffee during brunch? \n\nFood:\nI ordered lox and a bagel. Can't screw that up, but I will say that the bagel was small and they only gave my three rings of onion - not even a full slice of an onion! That lox and bagel was NOT worth $15. The cream cheese portion was not much...maybe a tablespoon. The tomato slice was a regular beef steak, not vine ripened and the tomato was pill-y. However, the lox was good. My bro ordered the corned beef hash which was good and meaty, and the hash browns were tasty and crunchy. Our meal came close to $70...for breakfast. \n\nWhy two stars?\nThe service is bad as is the food. Avoid this place and hit the buffet or eat at another hotel. Definitely overpriced and the service, food, and environment are not worth the price."
1,"Wow, very classy!  I was told terminal 3 opened about 6 months go and I must say that it is very well done and makes travel fun!  Don't fall or he lot machines though! \n\nWhile this airport I still under construction, (what airport isn't) it is still a big improvement from my last visit to Vegas!\n\nIf only United would have been on time I would had given a 5 star experience!!!!\n\nAfter experiencing LAX, it's easy to appreciate a well thought-out design!"
0,Totally not a bad place but my experience was a bit tainted by one of the staff. He had his jeans LOW and his underwear hanging out (trendy I know) but he always seemed to be on the verge of losing his britches. He handled his underwear as much as he handled menus and food. Thats an issue.\n\nI would have told the manager but there didn't seem to be one.\n\nThis place will get better as it matures and a lot of the initial new hire crew is separated out and we find out who is wheat and who is chaff.
1,Best Burger Joint ever.  That.  Is. All.
0,"A chain, so the items are still the same famous coffee we have all grown to love. The staff is very courteous, I don't know what it is though, no matter how small the order is, they ALWAYS mess up my order.\nALWAYS.\n\n\nIf I don't get to work on time this morning, because I had to come inside to fix an order I told them precisely in the drive through, today will be my last day here. \n\n\nHappy trails!"
0,There is black mold on the food!!!!\nDon't ever eat here you can get really sick. I told them and showed them after we already had a bite and they didn't care. So messed up
1,"Last week I bought a 10 pack of Terrific car washes for $159, more than $80 cheaper than buying them individually and they don't charge more for my SUV or my car when it's caked with dirt.  These guys are super fast and the best in the business."
1,"This place is usally packed with family or friends, but I have been fortunate to have never had to wait. I love the vegetarian options. My favorite is the tofu and asparagus. Wait, anything with flat noodles. Oh and how can I forget the curry bowls. Don't judge me it is a 9 page menu, which can be overwhelming. I am excited to keep trying more options as I continue to live here in Charlotte. I will take my mom next month when she visits so I will update my review then. She is going to love it. Everyone else that has came with me enjoys it. Lang Van makes me happy to live in Charlotte."
1,"This is my mums favorite chocolate.  For Grandparents Day...we tried to go to the See's at Arrowhead Mall. Called 3x and no answer.  Looked it up on Yelp, and not so good reviews.  Decided to wait and make the drive from Sun City to central Phoenix.  \nGlad we did. Super sweet, older lady at this location and much better reviews.  Purchased a 2 pound box of turtles.  She will love them. Which makes the drive totally worth it."
0,"The staff, barring the afternoon clerk on the day we checked in, were uninterested in anything other than getting the job out of the way so they could get on with their personal conversations. Food, on Thanksgiving, not well priced and very dry..everything was very dry. The heat in the hotel itself was on full blast (it was about 50 outside) and when trying to regulate the heat in our room, it was impossible to get relief from the stifling heat even with the window open. The television didn't work, and we couldn't rent movies because, as the maintenance man said \""oh this hasn't worked all week\"". Thanks so much. When we checked at at midnight because it was so miserable, no one asked why we were leaving. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this hotel. Oh, and the woman in the gift shop? She followed me around asking \""are you going to buy THAT?\"", etc. Completely insane and ruined my entire Thanksgiving. When the manager called to follow up on my having filled out the survey, he was defensive, angry and unwilling to offer anything to assuage my disappointment. Complete waste of money and time to go to this hotel."
0,"Very overpriced Asian food at the MGM Grand on the Strip. Worse, the quality of the food was entirely average. By my standards, a disappointment. If I'm going to pay double what the food is worth, it should be at least as good as most restaurants of the same type, not inferior."
0,"Huge disappointment. My husband's uncle treated us and my husband's parents here the night before our wedding. It was our first time to Las Vegas and we were so excited since we love Mario. We opted for the classic tasting menu to get the true experience. The first and second courses were great, but then it went downhill from there. Instead of each course building upon one another, it was as if the flavors were overpowering each other. This menu would have been better if it wasn't pasta after pasta after pasta. There was so much more that could have been done. For example, start with a single meatball, Then move onto a caprese salad for course two and build from there. The courses were too heavy. The beef in the pyramids of the third course was dry. The foie gras and truffles were both strong flavors competing with to beef cheek ravioli to be the star of the fourth course. The balsamic reduction on the foie gras ravioli was too much for us as well. Had the reduction been drizzled on the plate instead of my ravioli dunked in the sauce with more sauce poured on top, it may have been tasty. If that course was what made Mario Batali famous, he would be very disappointed on the execution of it. The best course was dessert and even that was nothing to brag about. Kudos to the chef for layering 1600 sheets of dough, but my pastry was too hard. The raspberry sauce was great and the pastry filling was silky. The last course we were served was a souffl\u00e9 of sorts. Mine was not cooked in the middle. If I had turned it upside down it would have ran onto the plate like soup.  The experience I had here almost made me cancel other reservations at a different celebrity chef restaurant. Thank goodness I didn't because the other restaurant was perfection. All in all the service here was great, but the chef needs to go back to culinary school. Do not waste your money here unless you choose to try something other than the tasting menu."
1,"Nice place to run and bike with incredible views of the city. I prefer the wooded trail portion because I'm not running on pavement, it's easier on my knees (I'm old). Lots of places to park along the trail, like Washington's Landing and near Heinz Lofts. The scenery makes this one of my favorite running spots, but there are definitely more people on bikes than on foot. As long as you can dodge them and trust that they'll dodge you, it makes for a really wonderful workout. Where else can you run along side a submarine?"
1,"The desserts here are absolutely great! Yes, few--very, very few--may not be to my liking, as in the taro snow fluff, (red beans are a little too sweet for my taste), but you can't always expect to love everything anywhere. Anyway, I've gone here more times than I should've the past month, but each time that I have the staff & owner are always so friendly and extremely generous. I always feel so welcomed whenever they remember my face! Not only is service fantastic but, as mentioned before, the desserts are absolutely yummy! Lol. My favorite snow fluff is the honeydew--which, by the way isn't on the menu yet ;) --and I love to get it with strawberry ice cream! Lol. Eating here is a great way to cool down, especially with summer about to kick us in the face, hahaha. And with their large-sized portions, there's no way anyone could ever stay hot in this weather. I'd say you get what you pay for, and sometimes more! \n\nAlso, this place is a chill spot to hang out. They have a few games on their shelves you can play while eating up your desserts. So not only do you get to enjoy your food but you get to have a fun time while eating as well! :) \n\nThis place is seriously my new favorite spot to hit at night, especially since they're open 'til 1am, (YAAAAAS! LOL). I wish them the best with their business!"
0,Placed my order on the application got there it was not ready had to wait for them to make it. What was the point of using the application if I have to wait? The Arroyo crossing location had my food waiting and ready for me when I used the application before. After waiting at this location my food was horrible the chicken is burnt and crispy yuck!  The vinaigrette for the salad was extremely salty. This location is right near my house but after this experience I won't go back. The Arroyo crossing location is way better!
0,"Can't believe this place stays in business with the horrible customer service their employees give. After yelling at me in front of my soon to be renter, the guy stormed off and wouldn't do the job. All I asked was that he clean behind the furniture, which I told him I would move. I even agreed to pay the extra cost he demanded, but he just screamed and yelled at me, then stormed off when I asked him to please do the job. The good thing was I found a professional company who did the job AND moved the furniture for me. \nBottom line, look elsewhere before being belittled by their employee. Not worth the hassle and embarrassment when there are better companies out there."
0,"I have no idea why this place is so popular. This is probably the buffet where I had to stand in line for the longest of times. The wait was about 1.5 hours, which is completely ridiculous when you taste the quality of the food. I think this place was also the most expensive, even topping Bellagio and Wynn. \n\nIn my opinion, this place is totally over rated, and I would definitely choose to eat at Bellagio in a heart beat. The only good thing about this place is that you get to watch the free air show while you stand in line and put up with your growling stomachs. \n\nOh yes to make things worse, when we stood in line there was a sneaky lady who tried to cut in. We had been standing there for over an hour, and this lady was probably 40 minutes behind us.  She pulled the oh-so-smooth \""pretend to be-friend us, while carefully sneaking behind us in line and one by one bringing her husband, sister in law, kids, nephews, nieces into the line\"". Geez some ppl are so rude and dirty.\n\nFood wise, this place offers seafood that is not very fresh or tasty. Go to one of the other places in Vegas instead, or even the Rio Carnival World Buffet (in the same Casino); which I give 5 stars."
1,"Great service!! They are the nicest people and run a wonderful business. This is by far the best dry cleaner I've found in the area. They really take care of my clothes and get out stains with ease. The turn around time is really quick too, and I have tendency to bring in a lot of clothes at once. Haven't gone anywhere else since I found Park Avenue Cleaners  almost 6 years ago.  Can't recommend them enough!"
1,It's rare that I give a place 5 stars but if you're looking for quick healthy food this is the place for you. Lots of flavor and good customer service.
0,"Whomp, whomp!\n\nHaving been to other Vegas clubs and clubs in LA, this club was boring. \nYes, they have a dance floor, tables, an outdoor patio, but why would I ever wait to get in here when I can go to a better club in Vegas. \n\nNot worth it!"
0,"I don't know what disappointed us more here: the service or the food?! Perhaps the poor service wins this battle, since the initial interaction with our server set the mood. I imagine we're not the first people to stay at Excalibur who decide to use the $20 credit here, since it's not valid at their buffet. We weren't going to waste the credit at a bar, where drinks are free if you're gambling. My husband and I stopped in here a little less than two hours before the Jersey Boys show, playing down the Strip at Paris. Doors to the show open half an hour early and we were going to walk there, so we knew we'd only have time for appetizers which was fine with us.\n\nWe presented our $20 credit upon ordering, as required, and told the servers we had a show to get to. He then asked when it was, and when we told him insisted we had time for entrees and rolled his eyes at us when we declined. I get in big trouble with hubby when I do this, and he was most unhappy at the unprofessional gesture from our server. \n\nBread was brought to the table as we waited for sliders for my husband, a Caesar salad for me, and seasoned fries to share. Although my husband ordered the sliders rare, and we are really comfortable with steaks cooked less-than-rare, the ground beef was cold and uncooked in the center of his sliders, and his caramelized onions were uncooked as well. The seasoned fries were unseasoned and a thick cut fry without much flavor. My Caesar salad was server without fresh pepper offered for it, and the croutons seemed like they were found in an old box, rather than house-made. \n\nOverall, the food disappointed but the service was the worst. We have no plans to stay at the Excalibur again, and without the free $20 credit for guests of the hotel, we won't be returning here either. They only get two stars because the hostess at the front was the only friendly face we encountered (she was super), and when we told her about the subpar experience as we left, she honestly wanted to make it right, but we assured her our decision to never return was everyone's fault but hers."
0,False advertisement!! My friends and I are not happy w the food here...it is a big dissapointment. We paid $60 for $10 worth of food. :(
1,Great food! Friendly staff!
1,This really is as good as it gets !!!!\nI went to Exclusive Paint and Auto Body after seeing their good ratings on Yelp.\n\nWhat they did was shocking.....when i went to pick up my Acura TSX from them after 10 days repair....i was not able to find out which side of the car was requiring the Body work..\n\nThe Story\n-------------\n\nBy Front bumper and fender were damaged and dented from a parking lot accident.\nI went to Exclusive for  repair and they gave a a Quote that i think i the most genuine i can think of...next I asked Jeremy if they could fix my rear bumper spots as well....he said yes and for the same price too.\n\n\nI came back and was surprised to see everything  fixed Extremely good as new.\nI would absolutely recommend this place for their professional work and for being very fair and genuine on cost. ( literally i ended up paying 4 times less than the quote an Acura showroom gave me)\n\nI am starting to use Yelp even more now....; - )
0,"Should have read the reviews... Got there and was charged a pet fee, which I thought I had already paid for via travelocity. They calmly explained that fees are \""at their discretion.\"" To clarify I asked, \""so, if I showed up and there was a random $100 hotel fee charged at your 'discretion' that would be fine with you?\"" They said yes!! SUPER SKETCHY!\n\nOur room didn't have any bedding and, when we called the front desk, they said they would call us back with a new room. (huh?) We had to explain that all we wanted was sheets. This seemed confusing to them.\n\nMuch later we noticed that our room has obviously not been cleaned because there were shampoo/conditioner bottles all over the shower. Maybe that's why they wanted to move us to a room with bedding? Did the last person steal the bedding? Did housekeeping only take the bedding and nothing else? Unclear...\n\nThe night before we left, we asked for a noon check out and it was granted. But at this point I wasn't so confident in the front desk's cognitive abilities. At 11 AM I called the front desk to confirm and they said we had an 11:30 check out. Nope. But whatever. We weren't eager to stay. \n\nFinally, my partner left his contacts in a bag in the bathroom. We kept calling the hotel but it took TWO DAYS for anyone to enter our room to clean it. (We left a pizza box so I'm sure that was fun) They insisted it wasn't there. We don't believe them. \n\nIf I'd read the reviews I would have stayed away. Location is ok but not worth the crappy service and dirty room. Another reviewer said \""if you want to pay Motel 6 prices don't come in expecting the Bellagio.\"" True, but I've stayed in cheaper Motel 6s and they were much better than this. Stay away!"
0,"It's hard to write a review for this place considering my friend and I were here for 1 minute before we were rudely shoed out. We came for drinks and the hostess said we could find at the bar. The bar was empty with the exception for 4-5 people sitting on stools. There were no more seats so we kindly asked a couple at a high top table if we could borrow their stools and bring them to the bar to sit down. The second we brought them to the bar to sit down, an employee rudely ran over to us and practically yanked the chairs from under us saying that \""those chairs can't be at the bar\"". He immediately put them back at the table and my friend and I just stood there confused and upset. He walked away and we (still standing at the bar) weren't sure what to do. The bartender stared at us and we walked out, clearly pissed, and not one employee looked at us. An absolutely horrible experience and I will make sure myself and anyone I know will never give this place a try again."
1,"Dear loving LORD I enjoy this place more than I should, because my wallet just can't and shouldn't...\n\nBut I always end up finding great items.   Pricey, but not for the boutique style.  The women who work it are always quite lovely.  The shoes are gorge.  Try googling if you find something you love; you may find it cheaper.  I love supporting this boutique, though, so I will always return."
1,Nice place to go for kids !
1,All you can eat sushi was good quality. Waitress said we could not finish but we proved her wrong! Four stars because dining area is tiny.
1,"I discovered Sweet Basil while trying to find a good vegetarian-friendly restaurant to take some out of town friends that were visiting for the weekend, and we couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. This was all-around one of the best dining experiences I've had in the city!\n\nWe started out with the Thai samosa and Curry Puffs. Each were flavorful, delicious, and fresh.\n\nI had the Cashew chicken with a spice level of 5 - it was absolutely perfect! A wonderfully-sized portion (that actually lasted for two more meals), complete with plenty of veggies and meat in the dish. My dining partner had the Pineapple Pork Fried Rice, which was quite tasty. So much food with so much flavor for the money. We had no issues with over- or undercooked meat.\n\nOur vegetarian guests shared a couple of veggie and tofu dishes and were very pleased with their meals. They dine frequently in New York City and said that Sweet Basil was still quite impressive to them!\n\nOur service was wonderful, we had no wait on a Saturday evening (around 5:30) - with no reservation, and the BYOB corkage fee was so reasonable!\n\nWe are already plotting our second (and third, and fourth...) visit to Sweet Basil, mouths watering as we speak."
1,"I am not sure about the dining in experience at Brothers. We have always had their pizza delivered to our office. Roughly ten people and everyone always loves their pizza. Caveman, Super Mario etc all have been great."
0,"THIS WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! \n\nI recently got my puppy and this was her first grooming so I was trying to figure out where to get her groomed. I found this place on groupon and saw 4 stars on yelp so thought it would be okay...it wasn't. \n\nI called Thursday and made an appointment for the following day. We debated about times so I called back later to verify the time I had. They'd never heard of me. At this point we book another appointment because we all make mistakes. I go in the next day to my appointment and THEY STILL HAD NEVER HEARD OF ME. This is where I should've taken the hint and left but they seemed like nice people and I'd already left work.\n\nThey get me in even though I supposedly don't have an appointment and the groomer comes out to ask what I want done. My puppy is a shitzu/poodle so I ask for a trim, just to clean her up....now she is completely bald. They cut everything off. I'm furious and she's freezing. It's just not right.\n\nI'm begging you all not to bring your dogs here. You don't know what you will get back."
0,"Went to the manny pacquiao fight and decided to stay here because of the suite option. I booked my hotel suite about two months ago requesting two queens and a pull out bed.  When i was checking in, the room check in guy said only a king is available.  I told the guy i wasn't trying to sleep with two guys in a king size bed.  The guy kept going to the back to supposedly \""see what he can do\"".  Yeah right, fool was trying to make me slip him a 20.  Getting a hotel room isn't getting into a club or cutting the taxi line, shady.  next thing you know i need to tip the guy who loads my luggage onto the conveyor belt at the airport.  fack.\n\nAnyways, the room hella sucked.  The tv in the room was a tube tv that was black and white and i had to hit every 5 minutes to get color for one minute.  the shower actually took a few minutes to get warm.  what the hell?  this is las vegas.  the shower head was horrible.  i just hated this place to save a few bucks.  stay away and stay on the strip.\n\nhit it hard my friends."
0,"If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. \n\nI didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.\n\nSpeaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??! \n\nWorst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest. \n\nI'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!"
0,"This was my first time eating at Red Robin and I've had a lot of friends tell me that it's amazing, so I was pretty excited to try it....well, I was not impressed. This is just like every other American fast food chain, but with a royalty card to keep you coming back, except I signed up for the card just to get the free appetizer.\n\nI had a really salty burger, with the \""unlimited\"" steak fries - fyi, you don't really want to eat that many, so that's probably why its unlimited. I thought the fries were just okay, maybe I had a bad batch, since everyone says the fries are good. The drink I ordered, some strawberry soda tasting thing, was not good, but came in a pretty shaped glass. That really shouldn't be the pro."
0,"What a pile.\n\nI will admit to not being an \""artiste\"" and maybe being too pragmatic to \""understand\"" what I saw when I went here about a month back, but sorry; like other reviewers, I am suspicious as what passes as \""art\"" in a contemporary sense.\n\nWhen I went, only a few small rooms were accessible (and from other reviewers' musings, this seems to usually be the case). The biggest of the rooms had two thin wood walls erected in the center. The \""art\"" inside these walls consisted of a bunch of TV screens which would show a picture, then say what the picture was i.e. a picture of a dog, then say in white letters on a black screen \""dog.\"" Somebody got paid to exhibit that? The other exhibit in that piece was hands-on, where you could write an answer to a posited question, i.e. \""What would you miss most if you left this planet?\"" Kind of nice they let you participate, but also kind of like something you'd see at some workshop for kids or something.\n\nAnyway, I didn't feel too unsophisticated when my wife, an arty-farty type, also disapproved of this place. With all the sponsors and this-and-that they proudly display on some fancy plaque in the middle of one of the rooms, you'd think they could come up with better (or at least more) of this so-called \""art.\""\n\nI will say the red room with everything made out of pallets was neat. Still, not worth it unless you're getting in for free with a culture pass."
1,This place has a very versatile menu and every time I go the food is delicious.\n\nThere are two; one in the Venetian and one in the Palazzo. I think that the venetian location is more private and the tables aren't so close to each other compared to the Palazzo one.\n\nAs soon as you're seated you are brought a warm basket of bread and butter to hold you over while you browse the full menu. This place wont let you down and is a must try!
1,"First time here.  It's always a good sign when there is a line at 730am.  I tried the Nova Lox Sandwich.. Delicious.  Everything bagel with cream cheese, nova lox, onions, tomato and capers. Comes with a good dill and a side of either potato or macaroni salad.  Add a large black coffee and I couldn't ask for more.  Possibly found my new breakfast spot."
0,"Don't come even a minute before 8:00 AM or they'll give you an ear full, doesn't matter what your needs are, you are just a customer."
0,"You know when you are going to visit relatives in another state and you do your homework and find the bitchin vintage shop you can't wait to visit? Me too!\nSo I step into Robert Black's store. And it's pretty damn cool. Amazing frocks spanning the stylish decades! Nothing stained! Plenty of room between garmets!\nI find this great 50's number. It fits perfectly. I am so excited to purchase it for my upcoming vacation.\nHuh. The woman working there says it looks as though it's on layaway. But she isn't sure why it was on the rack....she says she will call the owner. He doesn't know. She calls the other woman that works there. No answer.\nIt is getting silly and I decide to leave. The clerk takes my number and says she will let me know whether or not I can buy the dress on e she figures it out.\nShe never calls.\nThanks a bunch, Fashion by Robert Black. As great as your clothes may be, I will never return."
1,Had been to this place awhile ago (probably previous owners or before they remodeled) and was ok with the food but it was a bit dated (and there was a bug on my table).\n\nYears later came back with a coworker and wow have things changed! They've since redecorated and it's super clean now (no more fear of bugs).\n\nThe pad thai I had was delicious and coconut ice cream was awesome. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to get a Thai fix.
0,"My advice - see Mystere, O, or Ka instead! I can't understand why Cirque would undermine their brand with this production. Except for the final segment with human pyramids which was pretty amazing there was nothing original. In addition, there was so much filler with offensive clown skits and a sand painting artist! I wasn't a big fan of the Elvis production but I can't imagine how Zarkana could be considered as a replacement."
1,"Malasadas made from scratch!! Oh so ONO!!!   Still nice and warm! They had regular ones, Caramel Chantilly, Guava and Chocolate filled!   Made to perfection! The malasadas dough is very tasty, texture light on inside and golden brown with slight crunch on the outside. The fillings are all made from scratch as well. You can taste the difference. Lots of filling oozing out so careful when you take a bite you might make a mess!  I cant make up my mind which one I like the best, they are all so good! \n\nThis store was formerly known as Hawaiian Style Poke located in the strip mall on the  corner of Warm Springs/Arroyo Grande (across from Green Valley HS) . I found out about it  from Bread & Butter's post.  If you were there the weekend when they served 808  pastries from the islands well that pastry chef is now here!  Its just a walk in /carry out. No dine in.   I only zeroed in on the malasadas but they had slices of cakes in their case.  Also they still serve Poke, made to order.  On the weekends there will be plate lunches coming up.  Also chef said he'll be making Manapua! Service was friendly, love the Aloha spirt!"
0,"Worst customer service. I have a iphone 5 that's been recalled because of the sleep/power button. \nI finished working across the street around 9:30 am so I figured I'd just come by and see if they would give me a new one quickly. \nI walk into the store. \nWalked over to the Genius Bar area and noticed a women working there with a red iPad. A guy that works there came up to me and asked what I was needing and I told him. He then said okay talk to the girl with the red iPad. She will take care of you. \n\nI was standing next to her when another customer, a woman walked in and walked right up to her. (She was assisting another customer). She told the customer to get in line behind her. \n\nOnce she was finished assisting the customer I walked a bit closer and she just ignored me and greeted the women who just walked in. \n\nMaybe because I wasn't directly behind the previous customer, in line?!???\n\nI just walked out. Such a shame, I don't have time during my day to schedule a appointment with the \""genius bar\"". I just need a new phone, mine is recalled. Pretty simple. \n\nBut fuck it. I just left. It felt pretty horrible to just be ignored like I was today."
1,"I recently dined with a large party.  They had a great room to accommodate our group!  It is nice to dine with so many people and TALK with each of the dinner guests. \n\nThe staff was eager to please (took photos, made menu suggestions, recommended beers / wines...even swapped out the drinks if you didn't enjoy).  \n\nAs I dined with a large group, we ate from a set menu...appetizers of bread, spreads and Italian meats were delicious.  The salads were good.  I was pleased with my choice of the crab stuffed chicken and even happier with the cheesecake for desert!"
1,"I have loved MIckies Dairy Bar for over 20 years.  You don't go in thinking it's going to be a quick in and out.  This is an old-school diner type place, with great food, large portions, and reasonably priced.  It's the all about the tradition here.  Love it."
1,"We went here and I couldn't decide what to get! We ended up with the deep fried pretzels, (while awesome, way too big of a serving for 2), and I got the deep-fried cheeseburger. It was the Best. Cheeseburger. of . My. Life!!!\nPrices were surprisingly low considering it's downtown on the river.\nThe wait wasn't great, but it was a Saturday around dinner-time with a Dave Matthews Concert down the street... So I wasn't shocked at our 25 minute wait.\nService was fantastic. The server admitted to being new, but still blew me away. \nI will definatly go back, just to try the things I didn't get last time."
0,I went in about a month ago with a coupon for a mani pedi for $30. The French was an extra $5... Fine whatever. They charged my $70 when I walked out the door. Not to mention it all chipped off anyway. Don't go here. They try and sell you to death.
1,"Wanted a brunch place that wasn't a buffet.  This place hit the spot.  \n\nI started with some coffee, which I desperately needed to keep warm.  We were seated outside under heat lamps but with the winter wind, it was still quite chilly.  I got the turkey and egg white omelet and added Jarlsberg.  It wouldn't have been as awesome without the cheese.  Glad I remembered to add it.  Didn't even miss the yolks, but probably negated any of the health benefits of getting an egg white omelet by adding cheese...oh well.  It was yummy.  And, I had to indulge in the build your own Bloody Mary bar.  That was delish!"
0,"Came here for brunch and eh, nothing really special. It seemed like any other buffet on the strip. They had variety of food but none of it was so good that I wanted to get a second serving. Would I recommend this place, probably not but I went during brunch, maybe dinner is something different..."
1,"Highly recommend the fried chicken waffle - it looks dry when it comes out but once you put some maple syrup and hot sauce on that baby, it totally comes alive and all the flavors blend together so well. Yummy!\n\nAlso highly recommend the Over Easy cold coffee with cinnimon and mint, sweetened with condensed milk - very addicting, not too sweet and refreshing!"
0,"I want to love this place.  The location is great, the view is nice, the staff seem nice, and the prices are reasonable.  However, the food needs serious work.  The dessert menu needs to be replaced entirely.  I tried the mud pie and it was a huge slab of very hard frozen ice cream - not good.  I also tried the caprese salad the other day.  The tomatoes could have used more basil but were ok.  On the other hand, the small balls of mozzarella were far too numerous.  I would rather have a few chunks of better cheese.  The whole salad was covered in cheap (gross) Parmesan cheese (as was the bread).  This stuff is not cheese.  It has no taste and it doesn't belong on a caprese salad in the first place.  I suppose some Parmigiano reggiano could have been ok, but if that is too expensive, skip it.  I will be back, because I have been waiting for a neighborhood place, but please work on the food.  Good food does not have to be super expensive, but it takes some care with ingredients and preparation.    I hope to update my rating with at least another star in the near future - if not, I am sad to say, it won't matter because this restaurant will be gone."
1,"Love this place!! Clean and neat and opened late on Fridays. Offered lemonade and water for drinks , extremely good service and I left knowing I will be back again!"
1,"Tried the golden wings and pepper jack focaccia, both were very good, well portioned and well made. Not five stars though due to lunch took 1.5 hours and our bartender/bar waitress seemed to be overcome with tables and it took longer than expected to eat and get the bill paid and leave. I will definitely be here again for the golden wings and try the Philly spring rolls."
1,Great meal here with friends after running the LV Half Marathon. Started things off with an ultra small plate of selections from their impressive salad bar. I need protein! Screw the green stuff. The Lobster Bisque should not be missed though. Hammerred alot of the meats especially the Lamb Chops... wow! Tip: don't forget to ask for/try any meat sauces they have - the ChimmiChurri was nice. Take your lipitor afterwards & sleep nicely...
1,"I only went in to buy a few fish the other day, but the two ladies who were working in the aquarium area were so helpful its my new favorite fish place. They explained what fish would be best for my biTube, introduced me to a nice snail to clean my tank, and overall just made the experience very nice, quick and satisfying. I'll be going back for sure.\n\nBased on the other reviews, not sure I'd ever bring my dogs in there, and if they do actually sell dogs and cats that's very bad mojo. However, for fish, its a-ok."
0,"For what it cost, Sushi Roku was just okay.  Lunch for three of us ran nearly $250 (with no alcohol).  We ordered the mixed tempura, three of the signature rolls and three of the sashimi choices.  With just one sashimi selection costing nearly $40 and signature rolls hovering at $30 each, it didn't take long to run up the tab.\n\nThe sushi rolls fell apart way too easily.  The rice didn't have the right texture and there's no excuse for that at these prices.  The service was also spotty.  Again, not cool at these prices.\n\nThe decor is fine, but I am sure this place benefits from candlelight.  It was a bit dark and spare in the afternoon for lunch.  It also smelled like fish.  A sushi place that is this spendy shouldn't smell like fish.\n\nFrankly, I think you can get better sushi for the money in Vegas."
1,"The show was really fun and light-hearted. The best place to sit is of course in the middle, so if you can try to get seats there or some displays will be a little off the mark. It was really exciting to watch and they also have crowd interaction moments that helped get the crowd into it. There was an animated background but most of the time I forgot it was there in lieu of the performers. Definitely a fun show to watch, especially the Shaolin bit."
1,I attended Paint Nite today at a local restaurant through the use of a Living Social voucher. The instructor Linda was great she was funny and made the class entertaining and light hearted. I had a good time. The venue itself was Florida Cafe which was clean but not the best part of town I wouldn't want to be there for a night class. And the server for the restaurant was really slow with the drinks. \nI think these girls could do amazing if they set up a location of their own. \nBut given the whole experience of just the painting removing the Florida Cafe from it I had fun and would attend again at a different location.
0,"Don't waste your time here because they certainly don't care about their awful service. Went at 7 before the Darius Rucker concert Fri night. Waited at our patio table for 30 minutes for a server. Hostess & multiple servers passed & didn't acknowledge us. Ever. We should have left then, but it was the only restaurant in the entire complex that could seat us. Finally flagged down the hostess to get a server. Went for the $9.95 pizza deal that was advertised, only to be told after our orders were placed that they were all out of pizza. By 7pm, you're already out of the special?!?!? C'mon!!! Unacceptable. Ordered the mussels & crostini instead. Mussels were barely visible, they were so small. Overpriced & incredibly tiny. Ordered meatballs (came w/3) & a cheese plate. About 3 pieces of cheese & some nuts were on that for $10! These were all being shared among 4 people, yet the portions aren't enough to feed 1!! For our 4 appetizers, 4 glasses of house wine & 2 vodka soda's, our tab came out to $150. NEVER going back. Ridiculously overpriced, inadequate portions, worst service ever!!!!!!! How they stay in business is beyond me!"
1,"This place is like a must visit every time I come to Arizona. I'm assuming the original Nogales Hot Dogs purchased a food truck and uses this location as one of its stops. This place never fails to satisfy me. \n\nThey have this big cooler of three assortments of hot sauces, along with cheese, mushrooms, onions, and chili pepper condiments. The tacos are a fair size, though I had four to myself. The hot dogs aren't Costco sized, but with all the toppings in it made it sufficient. I don't know their hours, but it's always around at night when I swing by."
0,I feel bad writing this review. I was really excited to try these cupcakes with filling. The staff was very nice but the cupcakes were gross.  They tasted artificial to me. Maybe the same as or a step above a grocery store. I really wanted to like this place but I threw away most of the cupcakes after 1 bite. I felt like it was a huge waste of money. Sorry.
1,"Four Vegas stars for the  Wyndham Grand Desert Resort.\n\nA good chunk of my recent trip to Vegas was spent here.  Our group of 10 was best served condo style.  We had (2) two bedroom condos and (1) one bedroom.  The furnishings in our units didn't match the posted pictures on Yelp, but in my opinion that's not such a bad thing.  :) \n\nAll the units we had were furnished in an almost identical manner with lots of neutral colors, granite counter tops (in the fully stocked kitchen) and full size washer and dryer.  The 2 bedroom units looked over the pool area which is super pretty.  I bet it's a lot of fun during the warmer months.  They even have a separate pool for those 18 and over that would like to splash around without a bunch of little ones in the pool with them.  The 1 bedroom unit actually had a view of the strip which is rather unappealing during the day, but full of Vegas flash at night.\n\nThe master bathroom rocked although you better *really* like the person you're with because there is absolutely NO privacy.  I'm not even sure why there is a door since there is the big cutout for the jacuzzi tub (see photo).\n\nThey have a market and grill onsite along with a business center with probably 8-10 machines that are all free to use.  They also have an activity room with pool tables, a few video games and 4 Xbox, Wii stations.  The video games cost $.50 per game, but the Xbox and Wii were free.  Very nice addition if you have kids in your group.  And since all rooms come with a DVD player, they have a nice selection of rentals that you can borrow (for free, I believe).   I didn't do the tanning bed or get a massage, but they have those services, too!\n\nThis is a non-gaming resort, but there is a bar downstairs that has some video poker machines.\n\nIf you want to get your gamble on, they have a free shuttle that runs all day long (until 10pm) that will take you to the strip (Harrah's).  You could easily walk though as it's only a couple of blocks (Planet Hollywood and MGM are the two closest casinos).  That said, since you already do so much walking once you actually get to the strip, having a shuttle is a nice break.  \n\nThis place suited our needs perfectly and if I ever go back to Vegas for any length of time with kids, I would absolutely stay here again."
0,Omg!! Oyster is so fishy and the sushi was disgusting. Kitchen food was so bad. I cannot believe the food was not worth a penny. Gee!
1,"Before my latest trip to Las Vegas, I had read some current reviews by Yelpers about this restaurant, which has now been open for just over a year. I had gone to their website and their prices seemed very, very reasonable. This was one place I really wanted to try on this trip....\n\nAtmosphere... despite the Fish Netting hung on the wall and some trinkets from the Seashore... is very Spartan. The restaurant is set in a small Strip Mall. Everything... and I mean EVERYTHING... is served on Paper Plates or Paper Baskets with Plastic Utensils. Kinda cheapens the meal....\n\nWhat I ordered...\n\nSea Scallop Plate (**** $9.59) Six 2\"" diameter x 1\"" High succulent breaded Scallops fried to a golden-brown. On a bed a French Fries (****) fried the old-fashioned way... in a Paper Basket. With a side of Coleslaw in a 2\"" diameter plastic container... might as well been nothing at all. Loved the Scallops... on a Paper-Basket?!?! Reminds me more of something you'd see at a takeout place at a Pier or at the Beach. I have to remind the owners... this is a Sit-Down restaurant!\n\nClam Chowder 16oz (*** 1/2 $5.99) Clam Chowder, although very savory and very flavorful... was kinda Watery! Served in a Styrofoam Cup! Tasty, but was cheapened by the Styrofoam! But the Styrofoam goes with the Paper Plates...\n\nGot to try...\n\nMaine Lobster Roll (**** 1/2 $11.99) I know anything with Lobster is EXPENSIVE... but 1 Penny short of $12.00 is... like... VERY EXPENSIVE! Served on a thin-roll.\n\nPulled Pork Sandwich (**** 1/2 $6.99) Very good flavor! But... again... kinda small, if I ordered it.\n\nValue (** 1/2) Yeow! This place is for the mini-me kind of Appetite. I would have to order two to three orders just to be satiated... But, that's me, unfortunately.\n\nIn Summary: The Subs / Sandwiches are a good value... for Petite-Sized Appetites. When you delve into the Seafood, which is the hallmark of this establishment... that's when things get EXPENSIVE and the Value is almost Non-Existent. (****) for the Average Appetite kind of person. (***) which is definitely not me.\n\nBTW, BEFORE you order anything... peruse the daily menu notices located at the front of the order counter. I missed out on, the day I was there... a Pulled Pork Sandwich, a Meat Pie.... you just might like the Daily Menu more than the static menu items."
0,"What is going on Flamingo? This has been our go to place several times a year for the past 5 years. Great location but the service has gone downhill!  Wed. before Thanksgiving, 1400 guests expected, yet only 3 people checking folks in. Line for keys was even longer!! Took longer than usual to get our baggage, got to room and keys not working. Stay tuned for room rating..."
1,"This perennialy 1-2 Star neighborhood McDonald's recently underwent a complete remodeling, so I stopped in for lunch today to see if they're doing better.  It's nice inside with lots of booths (Yay booths!), and has a completely different floor plan than before.\n\nI went with a Quarter Pounder Haba\u00f1ero Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger, medium Fries & a small Chocolate Shake ($7.78).  Everything was right with both the food & the restaurant this time & it was excellent for the money.     :-))\n\nNow about those 610+380+570=1460 calories!     :-O"
0,They have ridiculously high prices for Mediocre food and mediocre service.  Save ur money and eat somewhere else!
0,"As a kid I remeber fallong down an open unmarked manhole, and not getting anything save a change of clothes and a freaking lollipop, they also refused to do anymore to compensate me. This also wasn't an emptied manhole, it was nearly overflowing. I will never go back to this park since this happened, and the lack of proper response."
0,"Again with the rude service at the cashier stand.  Food was delicious, but the employee at the cashier stand last evening at 7:00 PM ish was unacceptable.  \n\nI said three people for dinner not realizing one of my group still qualified for the kids pricing.  I was told to say that next time.  \n\nI am not asking for black tie, fine dining customer service.  Common sense and general friendliness would have been nice."
1,"Excellent value. \n\nInnocuous little place in yet another architecturally bland, semi-occupied Las Vegas strip mall.  I had the lunch special, an 8\"" pizza with one topping and salad.  The salad was straightforward, with minimal frills but fresh lettuce, tomatoes and a pepperoncini with the stem already removed (a nice touch I have never seen before).  The pizza was a bit oily, but that's why it's called pizza - and the thin crust pizza was nice and chewy.  It could have used some more sausage, but at $7.99 for the lunch special pair, I'd still say it was an excellent deal.  \n\nService was fine, and I had no issues of promptness (but the place was only about 30% full).  The place was clean, and assuming the bathroom was representative, it was well taken care of and/or brand new.  The fixtures were uninspiring (the tables reminiscent of what you'd see in a big chain like TGI Fridays).  I'd heartily recommend Don Antonio's to friends for a solid, non-fussy, good value dining experience, especially for lunch.  I can't find a single bad thing to say about my experience at DA's, the food was satisfying and there's particularly strong value in the lunch specials menu.  Even outside the lunch specials, it has a pretty big menu for such a relatively humble place."
0,"Expensive drinks, expensive to get in. It took hours for the dj we came for to even show up. Ended up leaving. Wish I could get a refund but that's never going to happen."
1,"Came in here just reading some reviews, figured, I'll give it a shot, they were good.\nI walked in to an empty restaurant and was worried, but the owner Frank was there to greet me and how pleasant he was. He saw the concern on my face and brought me over to family pictures showing how long the restaurant has been in business and has been a success.\nSo, not knowing what to order, because so many things looked yummy, he suggested the Pork Chop Florentine, OMG!!! DELICIOUS!!!\nAND he prepared it himself!\nI definitely, highly, recommend dining here when in the Pittsburgh/Greentree area.\nThe reason for 4 starts not 5, the wine choices are lacking but the Red Rock Malbec was nice with the meal. \nAnd Stephanie the bartender, super sweet and makes you feel like you're a regular.\nGreat place!!!"
1,Called this Macy's after the bad experience at the Macy's in the Meadows Mall.  The lady on the phone was very polite and helpful and even told us the item we were looking for was going to be on sale the next day.  We had bought some of the items off a wedding registry at other stores (they were much cheaper) and she said they could take them off as long as we showed proof (to ensure the couple really did get what they wanted).  We went here and the lady we talked to on the phone was not there but she told the lady working there all about our situation and they took care of marking the items as purchased on the registry and we got the other item on sale.  We will be back here for sure - customer service is so important - I hope Macy's in Meadows Mall learns a lesson.
1,To start I didn't even have a donut I had an died coffee carmel latte \n.  I am a big coffee bean fan and didn't expect much because I don't run  on Duncan but my wife and I were surprised very good flavor not overly sweet.  Lastly for 3.75 it was 30oz of coffee which for two people is perfect.  I will be back and my Starbucks snob wife even said she liked it..
0,"I had a cake made form here...12$ a slice , It looked very pretty and tasted terrible. I would have been better off going to the grocery store.. Its totally not worth getting a cake form here... and when I complained with the company, they told me that it must have been stored at the wrong temp. Cake balls I ordered were good, but again the cake was super disappointing...I am very sorry I ordered form here."
1,"Ohhhregahhhhhhnohhhhhssss!  That's how the name should be on the front of this Oregano's because it's pure Chicago style pizza ecstasy up in here.\n\nWe tried this location today because we were TCB that took us to the Maricopa area.  In contrast to the Scottsdale locations, this spot is relatively new, great parking, and wasn't nearly as busy.\n\nArrived around noon and were seated immediately.  Everything was fresh and delicious, even tastier than Scottsdale - the iced tea is somehow better at this location too."
1,"Amazing burger, amazing shakes would recommend. Also pretty decent service I will be back"
1,My dog has now had both knees operated on here and the did a good job both times with the dog and me. Not a fun time but they took very good care of him. I also board him here when I am out of town and the prices and quality blow away the others places.
1,Customer service is always an A+! My husband and I come in a lot! They have our drink order down as well as our food order!! Super friendly and they always cater to our needs! We love this pita jungle!!
0,Food was great and the servers were great but the manager was rude and unprofessional.  Sorry but Vegas is full of great places to eat so we will not be returning.
0,"This place should not be able to call itself Mediterranean at all. Frozen gyro slices and even frozen deli turkey slices. Meat was not cooked all the way through (like a microwaved burrito where it was still a little frozen in the middle). Oh, and where are the plates? Service was strange, putting it kindly. Would definitely not eat here again. Blegh!"
1,"Very nice staff, I'm going to miss it as I move a little further away. However I use the online ordering and it's great to wish other stores did this"
0,Overrated. I took my girlfriend here and now she is in the toilet puking... ok not really but this place sucks. \n\nbad everything.. wasted $65. :(
0,Two strikes you're out Barrio Cafe. I love supporting local businesses and have been so pleased to see the arrival of so many to the airport but when I'm at the airport I must put efficiency first. This is where barrio Cafe sadly fails. In the future I will stop in for a drink but I will only sit at the bar and nothing more. This is because the service is sadly some of the worst I've experienced. On two separate occasions I've eaten here and both times the lack of service have almost cost me to miss my flight. After serving the food the wait staff seems to disappear and it's impossible to find them. I would ask and ask and then when I note my need to hurry for fear of missing my flight I have been snidely commented to by the staff. The food and drinks are good but I think the customer service and efficiency needs major improvement if they want to be successful in an airport environment.
1,"They accommodated to me and my friends very generously! I ordered teriyaki chicken and he used some of it to make a roll he thought I would like. I love the service, atmosphere, food, and especially the staff! A must go if you're in Vegas or looking for a new sushi place!"
0,The food is ehh but I eat it when I waiting for my parents semi good food better than the caf. Food in my skyline college cafeteria good semi good quality.
1,"We had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadn't eaten all day. I'm the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or I grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off. Needless to say, I needed to eat before someone got hurt. \n\nWe had been wanting to try North End Pizza for awhile; so when I felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop. \n\nNo debating for me over what to order. Margherita special for the day? Yes, in a large please. And a side of fries. \n\nThe fries weren't great, weren't bad. I dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved. They brought out the pizza and I was a little disappointed- it was a bit skimpy on the cheese. \n\nAfter my first slice I was hooked. The crust is thin but not super thin, the sauce has a lot of flavor, and the mozzarella (what there was of it) was fresh. My husband and I ate the entire large pizza right then and there."
1,"Wow!! This place is great. Guy serving you the beer super friendly. Prices are average. Not a huge selection of beer, but not bad. Watermelon ale is yummy. Relaxed atmosphere. No food, but you can bring your own. Tours of the brewery available."
1,"It wasn't originally part of the week's plan to go see a show, but Carol W and I decided to check out Zumanity since we'd both hadn't seen it and we'd gotten a pair of \""free\"" tickets via the myVegas game on Facebook.  Anytime I can see a Vegas show, especially a Cirque show, without paying a couple of Benjamins on a pair of tickets for good seats, I count that as a no-brainer.  Of note, there we're several deals going on offering deeply discounted seats for this show and there were plenty of good seats seemingly available during the week on the day of show.  Of course, based on the layout of the Zumanity Theater, there didn't seem to be a truly bad seat in the house. \n\nZumanity touts itself as the \""sensual side of Cirque de Soleil\"".  It's definitely not like any of the other Cirque offerings in Vegas.  It's also definitely not family friendly.  However, it's highly likely that it'll offend religious conservative adults of most faiths, which should make finding tickets that much easier for those not so easily offended by dirty jokes and nudity.  Obviously, we had no problems with adult humor and partially clad men and women walking, writhing, jumping, swimming and flying up on/above/around the stage.  The show was fun, funny, interactive, and frequently jaw dropping with some of its amazing stunts.  The silk aerialists were my personal favorites.  Most importantly, it was entertaining and would've been worth it if we had to pay full price. \n\nMy thought as I was walking out of the theater was that Absinthe at Caesars owes a lot to Zumanity with its raunchy adult humor and amazing feats.  That said, Absinthe has improved on the Zumanity formula and, in my opinion, is the more entertaining and enjoyable show largely due to the more intimate venue, more memorable characters, and greater audience participation which made it feel much more spontaneous and much less scripted than Zumanity.  That all said, Zumanity possesses the Cirque magic and charm and is definitely worth your time and dime."
0,"My new favorite place! Best Chinese food in town. I first ordered food here out of convenience but am now hooked!\n\nI love their lunch specials. Great price for great food. I love their fast service. I called in a lunch special and was told it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived early expecting to wait and my food was being out into a bag as I walked in. And they have excellent customer service.\n\nUnfortunately after I wrote this review I had a change of heart. I waited over 20 mins for 1 orange chicken special. I wouldn't be bother by the wait except when others are out before me. After I ordered my food, about 7 mins later two people came in and ordered the exact same thing I had. 5 mins later they walk out with their food. Soon a few more people walk in and place their orders and they got their food within mins. Finally I was handed my 1 simple order of orange chicken. Don't think I'll be coming here as often as I planned."
0,"at least 2-3 times a week we order pizza and garlic knots at my tattoo shop...\n\n jamies pizza is consistently good.\nand quick delivery!  cheap too...\ncant go wrong.\n\ntry the salami on a pie!  its amazing.\n\nON oct 7th, after waiting on a 2hr delivery, paying 16 dollars, and getting the delivery screwed up and being served what looked like vomit in a box, i UNFORTUNATELY have to change this review to 1 star."
0,"The new owners are at best GREEDY! They had an event advertised for New Years eve and were selling tickets for $40 (adults) and $25 (kids), when I talked to one of them. He gave me all the details of the event along with the pricing. As soon as I went to book, I saw the only prices mentioned were $50.\n\nOn calling Kiran (owner) said, we never talked about the prices. On asking him to be truthful, he agreed and said that he will get back to me after discussing with another partner? Really when the partner already told me that he was the one responsible for the pricing. \n\nThis is totally unprofessional and unacceptable behavior. If they were not sure of the pricing, they should have waited till the next event at least."
0,"Oh Lordy...where to even begin? Like anyone else, we came here for the free breakfast and free show. Peter and I had been talking about timeshares, but we weren't informed. So we figured we'd reap the benefits of the breakfast and show as well as inform ourselves on what timeshares are all about. \n\nThe presentation was GREAT! It made so much sense! Why pay more to rent when we can save money by owning? I apply that type of logic to my daily life (I bought a house instead of renting one). Our rep, Jacob was really nice. He took us over to the resort...which was nice, but it felt more like a retirement home than anything else.\n\nWe were both up front with Jacob. We told him that we wouldn't be able to make a decision today. We likes the logic behind their sales pitch, but bottom line is we need more time to think about our finances. Jacob didn't like it. We just kept going around in circles. It turned from the mindset of \""let's get information\"" into \""let's get out of here!\"" \n\nWe finally were released from Wyndham's claws, and got our $40 deposit back. We got our free vouchers for Jubilee and a $50 American Express giftcard! Ultimately, we came up...but you pay for these incentives with your time and sanity. \n\nThe talk is NOT 120 minutes. We were there from 9:55am until around...2pm! CRAZY!!!!!!"
0,"Captivated by the price and the amount of buffets we can go to, we decided to give it a try!\n\n(+) Dinner at Le Village buffet at Paris was delicious! A huge variety of foods and they were all quite yummy!\n(+) It's cheap for 3+ meals, IF YOU GET UP AND USE ALL 3+ MEALS\n\n(-) Spicy Market buffet at Planet Hollywood -- \""#1 in Las Vegas\"" .....5 years ago\n(-)  Caesars' Palace buffet\n(-) Food gets repetitive. The buffets pretty much have the same foods ranging from crappy to crappier to wtf is this?\n(-) The buffet choices aren't that great\n(-) I thought we could go to the fancier buffets like Bellagio's or Wynn's\n\nI'm likely NOT doing this again. Of the three places I tried, the buffet in Paris is the best. And if for whatever reason I ever do this again, I'm going to Le Village at Paris for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"
1,"Great place to visit in the summer, lol.  From house league to public skate, a great rink for the entire family."
1,A place worth trying. Had brunch there and the baked potatoes were very good. Gotta visit next time
0,"Definitely a fun scene. Girls in bikinis, nice weather, great club music with better and better dj's every time. Here's my problem.. I got a cabana for a group of friends. I was told $650 minimum which wasn't a problem..the menu said a bottle of Grey Goose was $325 so I told our gorgeous server that two bottles would do it. Many drinks and dances later, long after \""scottsdale delirium\"" had set in, I am presented with a bill for over $900 and added a gratuity making it over a grand. On the bill it said a bottle of goose was over $400.. I wasn't sure what was going on and not wanting to make a scene after a fun day, I signed and left with a bitter taste in my mouth.. It's a good club in a great area but since when is treating a repeat VIP/cabana customer like that a good idea??"
0,I don't understand why people think this place is so amazing?  I don't care for the cattle like way they shew you through the ordering process and their food really isn't that good!  Maybe I'm just missing the boat here.\n\nThey make a killer cookie shake though!
1,"Nice little neighborhood brewery.  Small, nice place to meet before going to the Art Center. Clean and the beer's cold.  No food served here though."
0,These guys will cost Amazon some business if they ever try to use them for any delivery to this customer again. No need to elaborate any further...just read the other reviews.
1,"Love America's Taco Shop!  Carne Asada Burrito, that is all you need to know.  Nice people, fair prices, and good food.  If you are looking for an easy sit down dinner or lunch in the downtown area you should check out this place.  A+"
1,"Moreno's is known for their Sonoran Hot Dogs and because they're good I'm recommending the place.  I got some for 2 guys who are from Sonora and they said they're pretty authentic and yummy.  To get the full experience it is better when the guy is outside with the hot dog cart, but if he's not it's still good.  You purchase the Sonoran dog inside, they'll give you a ticket stub, then you give it to the guy outside and he makes the hot dog.  It's a good place to go if you want to try something different and have a craving for Mexican food.  Warning: the hot dog is a little too spicy for little kids because of the pepper that is included.\n\nOn my trips I also have their green chile burro.  My only problem with that is I'm not used to having beans in a green chile burro, however, it is tasty and it has good green chile flavor.  \n\nI've also tried their asada caramelo (beef stuffed cheese crisp) and it was slightly greasy.  The ones in Tucson are better. \n\nThe other reviews touched on other items on the menu.  The place is kid friendly and it's a great place to have a Manzanita (Apple Soda) or Aqua Fresca with your food."
0,"***THIS IS STRICTLY FOR THE LATIN NIGHT VENUE OF HOB***\n\nHouse of Blues Latin nights, Thursdays @Mandalay Bay, no goood :( ENOUGH SAID. lol.\n\nAll I can really say is that me and my girlfriend were really hyped to check out this night since there are not a whole lot of Latin nights in Las Vegas, and it sounded even better that it was at Mandalay Bay. I thought it was funny that on this particular night, as me and my girl were on our way over to HOB, we listened to the Dj say on the radio say \""This place is poppin tonight!! Whoop whoop!\"" YET when we arrived around at 12:30am,10 minutes before we heard the Dj's announcement, there was a total of 8 people on the dance floor :/ I would say the DJ over exaggerated a bit. \n\nThis was a very disappointing Latin night and what sucks is that this place has SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE GREAT. Great location, plenty of room to sit, a decent sized dance floor, music is perfect, BUT for some reason- NO CROWD!! I dont get it."
0,"I had to go to Stacy's after I heard people rave about the Turkey Legs at Cajun Fest. Unfortuntely, that's not on Stacy's regular menu. So I ordered the pulled pork sandwich for for $6 dollars along with the sweet potato fries. The pulled pork was good, but not the greatest. Although the sweet potato fries were decadently covered with cinnamon sugar. Easily the best sweet potato fries around.\n\nI ordered the half rack of ribs for $10.95 on my next visit. I did not like the ribs. Or maybe it was the sauce. I can think of many other places with better ribs like the Yard House, Shane's Rib Shack and even Chili's."
1,"Delicious food, a bar and such a friendly staff! Can't wait to make this a regular Taco Tuesday spot!"
0,I have been to Copper Kettle multiple times and in the past and when i say past i am talking about couple of years ago when they weren't at there current location. \nSo i was at copper kettle couple of weeks ago with my family for their buffet and long behold the food which was being served i can swear was from the night before. I mean come on people make some fresh food if you want people to come back and eat. I told me family this place was so good when i was doing my rotations that i have to go there again but was extremely disappointed. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because it was clean and the Naans were fresh and good :)
1,"This was the second store we visited. The first one at 1931 W Northern Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85021 had run out of donuts and we're not making more. So when looking for a Dunkin come to this one where they make them all day long. Good food"
0,I gave it two stars only because it's close to where I live! Other than that there's really not much to like about this location because the staff don't greet you or acknowledge you when your in the store. When checking out they have attitudes and are very unprofessional. Today I bought candles and spent a pretty penny and the cashier didn't offer to wrap my candles and put then in three tiny bags that were very heavy and not protected.
1,"Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \""what it is.\""  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!\n\nWhile the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure."
1,"Love this bar!  Almost all of the ladies at the bar were raving about the amazing smell.  Some of the possible reasons that I can think of are:\n\n* As you enter the door there is a bronze bunny with a bouquet of fresh lilies abounding.\n* The bartender informed us that she burns incense.\n* I can't explain the clean woodsy aroma, maybe the bar/building materials.\n* Non-smoking, yay!\n\nThe atmosphere is welcoming and comfy with plush couches and seats lining the right side and a pretty wood bar along the left.  The d\u00e9cor is dark and full of character.  The people are awesome and totally non-douchey.\n\nNow, to the important stuff - the dranks!  They have an amazing craft beer selection, including the coveted Joseph James German Chocolate Cake Milk Stout.  Prices are good; beers are $6-9 and their exotic mixology drinks are around $8.  \n\nThe location is just on the outskirts of downtown in a slightly seedier area, but that's ok.  Probably why it wasn't super crowded and how they manage to keep the JJ GCMS on draft so long.  At Khoury's they sell out of the JJ GCMS in a matter of hours whenever they tap that keg.  There was plenty of easily accessible curbside parking."
0,"My experience seemed quite different from others. We arrived a few minutes early and they seemed quite put out. They were very annoyed that we had 2 more people than we said we would. They handed my daughter an iPad and told her to pick out dresses, then they left. So we are all sitting there while she looked at this iPad. How about if they ask you to do that ahead of time? They brought out a couple dresses and then one that was nothing at all like she described.  Then they kind of disappeared again. So we just sat there and then got up and left. No one said goodbye or anything. The whole thing was extremely awkward,embarrassing, and rather humiliating. I would not recommend them to anyone."
0,"I went to Rice Paper for the first time this weekend- on the recommendation of a trusted \""foodie\"" friend, but I was really disappointed. I find Vietnamese cuisine is generally accommodating to vegetarian diets, but this was not the case. \n\nFrom the start the service was really bad (had to ask for water, then silverware, then the check, you get it). When we finally got service, the food was very boring (bland fresh rolls, overly spicy curry) and just not that tasty....\n\nWe sat outside and, although the night was fine and the atmosphere was pleasant, the bench seating was dirty which distracted me from the decent ambiance. It wasn't a horrible experience but definitely not worth revisiting. \n\nHave fun if you go, though!"
1,"This is one of my favorite hookah lounges in town. They have great service with really nice staff. After having gone there for years, the entire staff knows my name and will always greet me when I sit down. \n\nThe food there is always really good. My favorites being The Chicken NaNa, the spicy Mediterranean chicken wrap and the hummus. They also have great teas and coffees that are always enjoyable.\n\nThe hookah is the real reason I go there though. They have a great selection with really great quality tobacco. Some of my favorite mixed being Pumkin and vanilla, sweet november, bunny bomb, Saphire, and Godfather grape mint.\n\nMy one complaint is that on the weekends it turns into a club environment. When I go I like to go to chill and relax. The DJ is usually so loud on the weekends that you cant even have a conversation with someone sitting right next to you, which also makes ordering a pain in the ass. \n\nOverall though, a great place with great prices.  ."
1,"I stayed at Treasure Island the weekend of August 15-17 for the first time and I must say that they have excellent customer service. I fogot over $600 worth of gift cards in the drawer upon checkout and housekeeping returned them to lost and found and the gift cards have since been returned to me in California. I doubted that they would be returned but to my surprise there are still good people and great service providers out there.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! House keeping and valet services was prompt even though there were ample events going out at the hotel. The Pool/Cabana area is live with great music and the rooms are modern yet cozy. My only gripe which prohibtted me from giving 5 stars is that the only place to eat after about 2pm is at the Coffee House and the line was extremely long."
0,"This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed, but absolutely terrible.  Not that we ate the food, because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks, our appetizer came out with no silverware, no plates, still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter, he brought the drinks, still no plates and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no plates and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill, are looking for terrible service, aren't in a rush, and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise, stay away!"
0,"We got a Groupon for this place, actually we got 2 ... huge mistake!\n\nThe first my wife and I used and were not impressed with their food nor service, but we had a second so we gave them another try.\n\nThe second experience was WAY worse.  It was a Friday evening and we took the kids.\n\nFirst, off we arrive and stand around waiting for about 15 minutes before being greeted.\n\nSecond, the ambiance could have been good, nice tank with turtles giving a gentle waterfall sound.  Peaceful music playing setting a nice tone.  If it weren't for the TV showing some stupid game shows which completely drowned out the rest of the peaceful ambiance.\n\nThird, after placing our order we began to wait, and wait, and wait.  Over an hour we wait for our food.  Finally about the 90 minute mark our food comes out ... except its not our food!  There were 5 of us, and the food came out was for 2 people.  Oops!  Come to find out our order had not yet been sent to the kitchen.\n\nAt this point we left.  Unbelievable!  I guess I'll have that groupon until it expires.  I guess they win that one, but they lose, over all."
0,The staff here were vultures. They kept sending different people after me to try to talk me into something I wasn't asking for and didn't want. I wouldn't even consider going back. People like that need to find different jobs because they are giving dealerships and car brands a bad name.
0,"This place was horrible! I paid 200 dollars for dinner for two, my steak was still mooing! If you are in Vegas and want a real steak, Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse does it right!"
1,"We went there for a surprise birthday party and were about 20 people. It was a great night. The service was fast, food was good, so was beer. We got 2$ special house shots after 10 PM and a bottle of something for free because we were more than 20 people. All in all a really fun night. I have to go back though to try other things on their menu. We had the wings (hot) and they were awesome."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this!  It was $16 per person to share a gondola and our gondolier, Mario, was absolutely the tops: charming, knowledgeable, and a wonderful, wonderful singer.  They seem to all be this way.  As Mario put it, \""they hire actors/singers because it's easier to teach people to steer a gondola than it is to teach them to sing.\""  \n\nBeyond that, of course, the Venetian is simply stunning and a treat to be paddled around in.  :-)"
0,"I don't understand how they are always out of beers on tap! I live right across the street from this one and get bad service all the time. \nBut I love to go to the hualapai one, the People are friendly and not rude!"

0,"All I wanted was a Coast brand flashlight and trinkets.  There's about 5 or 6 sword, knife and hand weapons vendors.  A ton of crappy clothiers and wig shops.  The A/C was barely tolerable.  I'm never setting foot inside again."
1,"I used WBC and had an excellent experience.  Barren (driver) arrived promptly at my home, drove safely and was very polite and friendly during the 20 minute ride to McCarran airport.  \n\nWhen he arrived, I fully intended to roll my own suitcase and bag out to the cab, but he took those out and carefully loaded them into the back of the SUV.  Thank you, WBC and Barren for such a positive and fantastic cab-experience!  No doubt, I will use WBC again in the future and request Barren."
1,Simply Lovely and Unique!  We enjoyed all the unique oils and vinegars they offer. Very relaxing place to stop and shop a little and have a bite to eat.  Get some fresh baked olive bread and enjoy with some amazing olive oil and specialty vinegars.
1,Best green chili fry bread!!! I have had several other things off the menu and have never been disappointed!
0,"Wow, I'm beginning to think there is no great Mexican food in AZ. I moved here from Chicago a year ago and have been to about 1/2 dozen Mexican restaurants with 4 star plus and reviews and I'm left thinking, \""really\""? \n\nI dropped in last Friday late afternoon after the Sox-Cubs game in Glendale with my daughter. I live in Goodyear and thought I would give this place a try based on the reviews. Nothing fancy in the ambiance. It's a small storefront location, place your order at the counter, sit down and someone brings your order. The gentleman at the counter couldn't have been more pleasant. Patient, smiling, helpful. I was really excited to see the place full of locals. (Usually a good sign, right?) We ordered a steak and chicken burrito dinner and sat down at a table.\n\nThe chips and salsa were pretty good. There is an awesome salsa they provide that was really tasteful (tasted a little smoky and spicy) The salsa bar was pretty good, too. Their carrots and jalapenos were very good. At this point, Don Pancho is grooving in the 4 star range.\n\nAfter about a 25 min. wait for our food, the kindly gentleman brought our order over to the the only other Caucasian couple table in the place. I stopped him and asked if that was our order and the other couple (obviously not too familiar with Mexican food and they came in 15 mins after us) looked confused- but they ordered tacos. So the kindly gentleman brought our order to our table. All down hill from here. Steak burrito- grisly, tough, overcooked, too salty. Chicken burrito- tough, boiled, bland. Beans were really great. Rice was okay. Man was I disappointed. I've read other reviews and was really hyped to try this place out. Also, there were about 4 people waiting for about 30 mins for their orders. I'm really not too sure what takes them so long to deliver, but if the food was worth the wait it doesn't matter. I can't say it was.\n\nAfter one year in Phoenix, Senor Taco is still the best experience I've had with Mexican food. (Who would of thought?) I'm going to start visiting the taco shacks on 85. There has to be a diamond in the rough here somewhere."
0,"Disappointing food for the high cost.\n\nThe ceviche ($10) does not come with raw fish cooked with the acids of a fresh lemon, but rather it is canned, cooked fish sitting in bottled lemon juice. The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.\n\nMy colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.\n\nBesides that, friendly service and a good beer selection."
0,"I've been here a couple times, not looking for anything in particular. It's a large space and fairly clean and bright but for some reason this place really skeeves me out. I can't quite put my finger on what it is though.\n\nThe women's section is fairly large. The last day that I went, skirts were pretty sold down the \""non-summer clothing\"" was abundant. The men's section looks limited but I didn't take the time to walk through it. Kid's was fairly limited as well.\n\nI usually enjoy thrift store shopping and searching through the racks to find that one awesome piece of clothing, but this location doesn't really have that going on...at least not for me anyway."
1,"This was my first vegas buffet spot many moons ago which made me come back once more. Their sunday bottomless mimosas are always a fave. Their dessert choices weren't as varied as MGM's but their entrees were OMGSOGOODIWANNAGOBACKFORSECONDS good. The downside, the wait can get to be RIDICULOUSLY long!"
0,"Most pretentious place I have EVER eaten. The chef \""doesn't believe in ranch dressing\"". 3/4 of the items on the menu have ingredients that you can only pronounce if you are fluent in every language in Europe and Asia. I hope that this review saves at least one person from eating here."
1,"I brought my Lexus to Toyoworks as a result of the preceding Yelp reviews, and can see why they are all 5 stars.   In a business in which trust is often at issue, Andre and his entire crew go the extra mile to demonstrate the work that they did (in my case they even took photos and showed me on an iPad the existing damage and resulting repair), and communicated throughout the process so that I knew what work was being done and why. \n\nOn top of that, they could have taken advantage of a check engine light by proposing that it was a more significant problem, when it was in fact an inexpensive gas cap that resolved the issue. \n\nGreat work, on time, and with comfort and trust, all at a reasonable rate... what more could you ask for from a mechanic."
1,Great environments! Only downside is service is a bit slow !

0,"The hostess was not able to help when we asked where our party's reserved table was located ( probably because no one updated the iPad, she was completely incapable of problem solving) So we missed the surprise for our friends b day because not a single staff member was able or willing to assist us, they avoided eye contact, one server actually pretended not to see me, I was 2 feet from her . Service ultimately was slow but friendly. The pretzel app was very yummy and the dinner was good, sliders.  The place is too big for efficiency or they need to hire problem solvers. If you have time on your hands the food is good, loud and live music too. Only 2 stars for ruining the surprise party."
1,"As the duchess of Sumo Sushi, I'd be doing it a disservice if I didn't post a review. :) \n\nPositives: always delicious. Generous portions. \n\nNegatives: on many occasions I've gotten a roll that was different than what was according to the menu. They hand you two menus: one with pictures and one for AYCE. The rolls on each are listed with different ingredients. You may think you're getting one thing, but you end up getting another. I've mentioned it to them more than once, and the language barrier(?) has gotten me nowhere. \n\nGood luck!"
1,Hems...\n\nWill always like this place because of so many great memories there.\n\nThey have pretty decent food and a good selection of beers for a college bar.  Prices are very good but can get extreamly crowded at night and on weekends.
0,"What a waste of money. Me and six other guys went here the other night. We called ahead and were told that we had a table reserved. When we arrived, we were told that there were no tables available and that the hostess just wanted us to come and wait. Fortunately, there were tables outside available after a few minutes wait.\n\nOur waiter, who didn't come to our table for 5 minutes or so, gave us our menus and walked away. When he came back again, he said, \""Did you guys already order drinks?\"" We hadn't. Isn't it his job to ask for our drink orders? So we order drinks. He forgets two of them. It takes him another 10 minutes, roughly, to get back to our table and take our order. Basically, the entire night, our waiter paid us very little attention. \n\nOur food was mediocre. When you are paying $50 per entree with everything else a la carte, your food better be effing spectacular. It wasn't. I got the filet, oscar style, which was $51, plus two sides, which were another $25.  My steak was overdone to the degree that I couldn't chew some of it. The mashed potatoes were good, but a small portion for $12. The asparagus was also good, but again, it was $12 for a two person portion.\n\nThe reviews from the other six guys were very similar. The food was fine, but nothing special at those prices. For the seven of us, the bill came to $575. I wouldn't go back. It is WAY overpriced for the quality and service we got that night."
0,"What happened?! Sushi bomb used to be great. Hate the new menu layout, my favorite roll is gone, I would have paid more for the old menu and quality of fish. Almost gagged when I was served bad uni. SO SO SAD!"
0,"Oh my, I cant believe I haven't written a review about this hotel and it was my 1st Vegas hotel I've stayed in!\n\nSo for my 1st Vegas trip my cousins who has been to Vegas a handful of times took charge and booked everything! We arrived at 10pm friday night and it wasnt busy at check in maybe 10 mins total and we were on our way to the room. Hotel was kinda outdated but some rooms were updated with  flat screens and what not, which we were able to get one of those rooms. The only complaints about the room was that  the bed was hard, room still smelled like smoke in a Non-smoking room and one night a handyman came to our room saying we called for someone to fix the tv?! Strange. We also ate at their buffet which wasn't that good, everything was kinda boring! I most likely wont be staying at this hotel again cause its also at the end of the strip!"
1,Yea...we need to eat @ 4am...biotches.....bahhahhaa and now they have a bar....whhooo knew..with fatburger beer!! Whhhat what!!??
1,"While I am very surprised to be the first to review this fabulous Italian eatery, I also find it to be a pleasure as well!\n\nNestled in the heart of Carefree's shopping centers and eateries on Easy Street located right next to a nail salon is this quaint, elegant, and sophisticated little restaurant. Inside there are about 15-20 tables. I had made a reservation for our party of 4 not knowing how busy it would be on a Friday evening at 7 in Carefree and I'm glad I did. This joint was hopping!\n\nWe were given water and a basket of delicious toasted and warm bread with an herb butter. I'm so tired of those \""trendy\"" places that think Olive Oil and balsamic is a proper topping on bread.  Not so at Giordano's...they offer olive oil but the butter is where it's at.\n\nWe were greeted promptly by our server who suggested a great wine for us. We ordered calamari as our appetizer. Calamari isn't my favorite because it's usually so overcooked and chewy that it's just not worth the money. Giordano's used panko breading and these calamari were fried perfectly. The accompanying marinara sauce was fantastic as well. Not too sweet and not too tangy.\n\nOne of my party ordered the chicken and the other veal marsala. I ordered the Giordano's chicken which was chicken parmesan but with a slice of eggplant onto of the chicken before it was breaded. It was fabulous. The veal was fork tender and very flavorful. The chicken marsala was not over-cooked like some tend to be and each of us had an accompanying side of vegetables and our choice of penne or spaghetti. We all chose penne and it was perfectly cooked. The vegetables were al-dente and had been tossed in a buttery sauce. They weren't dripping in the sauce, but rather, the sauce was just kissing the veggies. It was quite heavenly. \n\nFor dessert we shared a tiramisu and cheesecake. I am usually not a fan of tiramisu because the ones I've experienced had such a strong coffee flavor that it was off-putting. Not so at Giordano's. This was tiramisu with a background flavor of coffee like it's supposed to be. The cheesecake was rich, creamy, and probably the very best i've ever had, and I've had NY cheesecake in some of the finest NY restaurants. \n\nOur server was friendly and non-intrusive. The busboys were equally non-intrusive and kept to themselves. It was a bustling place and while these servers and bus people were busy, they never made you feel like you were bothering them.\n\nI highly recommend Girodano Trattoria Romana in Carefree. It is pricy, but you have to expect that given the location and the local clientle.  I am trying to figure out a way to make an excuse to drive up there REAL SOON! :)"
1,"Best dim sum I've ever had in Vegas! I will have to make a point to come here on each Vegas trip! There is a line, but we got there just in time we didn't have to wait too long. They have all my favorite dim sum carts so I'm not complaining there. All so tasty. Didn't try anything off the menu but the dim sum won my heart so... can't wait til next time, Ping Pang Pong! \n\nSuch a cute name. :)\n\nOh, service was okay. It's Chinese (I'm Chinese) so you know how it goes."
1,"This was so much fun. \n\nNOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR CONSERVATIVE ASIAN MAMA.\n\nI'm glad I didn't. This was so Rihanna-Rated-R, and SO MUCH FUN. I love their openness. I can see how a lot of narrow-minded people would not enjoy this because it certainly skirts the boundaries of sexy to lewd. \n\nThere was definitely not one crude moment and my absolute favorite was the host, who I think is a man dressed as a woman.\n\nThe main focus of this show was definitely 1) sensuality, then 2) humor then 3) acrobatics. There's not as much emphasis on contortion, gymnastics, etc as much as other Cirque du Soleil shows so if you're looking for that, then I suggest trying out the other shows."
1,"Quite delicious for brunch. I am not normally a sweet breakfast food person, however the buckwheat waffle with a mimosa seems to be a perfect combination."
0,"The wait was about 30 minutes for this place on a Saturday night, considering that awesome late night urge to consume pizza after copious amounts of drinking and debauchery.\n\nMy friends and I waited in line, and they managed to order their pizzas. I was behind them, and the guy taking orders/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.\n\nPS The pizza's mediocre, but insobriety makes everything better, doesn't it? Not worth the buck."
1,Good food. Kind pricey as they charge for the extras.
0,"If they're open at 11, the bartender and a security officer are unaware. Just standing here looking stupid. \n\nWent to viva salsa instead. Then home. Not gonna gamble here if they don't know when they are open."
1,"\""I ate sooo much, now I gotta go to sleep\""!"
0,"We went with high expectations, but were disappointed in the flavor of the vegetarian bowl. The meal was presented nicely and the food looked fresh, but the broth had zero flavor even with the added garlic paste. The noodles were cooked properly as well, but flavor is critical."
0,"This place is terrible. They are always unprepared, slow and just unpleasant to do business with.  I am an avid starbucks customer and this is the worst location I have ever visited."
0,"I think I may have food poisoning after eating here 4-5 hours ago. Achy joints, running to the bathroom, chills... Friggin' McDonalds."
1,"The clearance items sell out like hotcakes.\nThey're a lot more out of stock than other Hollister stores on print / summery items.\n\nComfy clothing, though sized a bit bigger than what it says.\nTheir summer cotton shorts are sized a lot larger than denim daisy dukes.\n\nThere are size variances even within the same clothing categories such as bandeau.\nSome have cups in them, others don't, some are tight, others are loose.\n\nI usually go for the clearance section to find clothing of value.\n\nGot lucky a few times. Friendly staff most of the time.\n\nIts just too bad the store is flippin dark and its difficult to see the true colors of your clothing :p"
0,"Went in looking for new running shoes. I was promptly greeted by an employee who was already with a couple so I walked toward the back where there were two employees talking. One walked out, I told him I was looking for new running shoes. He told me I was in the wrong section (I was in the kid's section because I was looking for help...). He sang a song about how I needed to move forward, then started talking to the other customer about how cold it was. I stood looking at nothing, waiting for this person to direct me toward a good pair of running shoes. Two minutes later with no help, we left with no goodbye. I hope that guy doesn't live on commission because he's probably starving. Epic fail in customer service."
0,"A 15 minute wait to drive through window pretty much invalidates your status as \""fast food\"" I could have been served at a sit down restaurant and be done eating by now."
0,"So this place has come apart like a $2 watch. Staff is friendly, I will give them that. But the restroom today was FILTHY & DISGUSTING. (see photo) Order was correct, but hash-browns were COLD and I had to take them back and ask for fresh ones. Ugh!"
0,"Massively over rated bar in my opinion. I had heard great things about this place. I was looking forward to spending some time in a cool old bar with years of history and nostalgia. The beers on tap were going to be varied and awesome. Sadly all of this was far from the truth. \n\nThe bar is old, which is fine. But it's also dated and dull. Vintage has become boring and the overwhelming brown tones were not my thing. The staff were pretty unfriendly and did not seem that interested in recommending any of the beers on tap. \n\nNot sure what the attraction is. It completely lacked atmosphere. Maybe I'm just used to going far better places doing the same type of thing, but with far more edge."
1,Just got take home from here. Best food I have in a while that I did not cook myself. Staff was pleasant and had food ready before they said they would under fifteen minutes. I will tell everyone that is looking for Chinese to go here. Next time I go out I'll be there to eat in the patio I spied when walking in.
1,"\""I will gladly pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today.\"" Or, frankly, anything on the menu from The Gladly, one of the top \""Hot New Restaurants\"" to open in Phoenix within the last year. \n\nFormerly the matronly Ruth's Chris Steak House, The Gladly overhauled the old fashioned, frumpy, overpriced steakhouse and enlisted the talents of Chef Bernie Kantak, fun-loving, champion mixologist Richie Moe from sister restaurant Citizen Public House in downtown Scottsdale (near BS West) and a solid, conscientious team. \n\nWe happily stopped in The Gladly for lunch to sample their fare. An outstanding appetizer choice is the Pistachio Chicken Liver P\u00e2t\u00e9 ($9) served in a petite Mason jar with crostini, sage mustard, pickled onions and capers. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is rich and creamy, without the iron-like taste of most livers. If you're not up for the challenge (it is liver, after all), you'll definitely be a fan of the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with creamy sweet corn grits ($10) accented with shaved Pecorino-Romano cheese and truffle oil. Outrageously, madly, fabulous, it's bound to be a staple on The Gladly's seasonally changing menu. It's gluten free, but big deal. Who cares?\n\nCounting carbs? The Blue Cheese Steak Salad ($16) is one of four salads. This salad has generous pieces of tender, juicy, charred Port marinated tenderloin that almost falls apart when you look at it. This all rests on a bed of baby kale, field greens, Point Reyes bleu cheese dressing (ask for extra. Trust me.) bourbon soaked cherries with sweet potato chips. \n\nThe B.B.L.T. sandwich--one of five--is stuffed with thick-cut Buckboard Bacon, baby lettuce, tomato, aioli (which seems to be everywhere. Sometimes I just want old fashioned mayonnaise.) on a pretzel roll for $10. Hint: This bacon is thick, giving it a different texture, also imparting a slightly stronger taste than what you're used to. It's not your traditional BLT. Not quite. Word is The Pigstrami ($14) with smoked pork butt, Swiss cheese, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, Dijon mustard on rye is a dream.\n\nTry the Chimichurri Chicken Breast ($14 - half/$24 - full) gives you buttermilk Smart Chicken (that means it's organic and humanely handled) perched on top of a tasty fingerling potato casserole in a mild, creamy chili sauce. A half order is filling.\n\nSome of these dishes appear on the dinner menu. Don't miss out on the \""brunch\"" dishes that you can order every day. We hear the Chilaquiles Rojos ($10) are a showstopper.\n\nIf you're on a liquid diet, you're absolutely in the right place. Perch yourself at their bar and let the knowledgeable (and dare I say super hot!) Brian Goodwin, the Bar Manager, introduce you to their vast repertoire of speciality cocktails that will stun and amaze you. No kidding. The classics are all there, sure, but try something unique--that's their specialty. The Thai Margarita is Patr\u00f3n Silver tequila, galangal (ginger) and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, basil and lime with Thai chili sea salt on the rim on the rocks gives an Asian spin to this Mexican kicker.\n\nThe Gladly features 220 different whiskeys. Play \""Mr. (or Ms.) Big Shot\"" and order the \""Isabella:\"" Glenlivet Nadurra 16--year Scotch, Martel VSOP Cognac, sweet vermouth, B&B with Peychaud's and Angostura bitters. The crowning touch is when they make a perfect, clear tennis ball sphere of ice out of sushi grade ice before your very eyes (no kidding, it's quite the feat! Especially if Brian makes it. Gun show!) Exquisitely crafted and a Cocktail Bucket List \""Must.\"" Worth the $15 splurge. Select Gladly fab-ly cocktails are featured during their happy hour, seven days a week, 3-6 p.m. along with $5 select wines and half-off appetizers & draft beers.\n\nOnce a month Chef Bernie creates a six-course dinner, paired with six cocktails for only $75. Get a gaggle of friends and take advantage of this special event. Maybe Brian will make those cocktails, too. Call for details. About the dinner, that is. \n\nYou'll be a gadfly at The Gladly. Guaranteed. Go!"
1,Wow. Very good Food. Nice cashiers very nice waiters. \nFood very good desserts delicious. \nEverything was Perfect. \nOnly neg points: no hot tea for lunch & no signs what you are eating. You always Must ASK somebody. \nOverall very good.
0,The tool rental manager was not the friendliest person there!  Terrible experience definitely not coming here again...
1,Staff and Doctors were very nice and helpful.  I enjoyed the experience with choosing my frames.  I also enjoyed the frames they carried.  I am a guy that likes more of a sporty look and I loved that fact that they carried some nice Oakley frames.  I will definitely continue to be a patient of their's.
1,"Such a laid back place to get some serious help!  I suffer from severe back problems and Dr. Brim uses personalized techniques to help alleviate my pain and move me towards recovery.  Being able to walk in without an appointment is so convenient and I have yet to experience more than a 10 minute wait. They are quick, efficient, friendly, and by far the best chiropractors I've ever had."
0,"I thought I'd give Bite me a try since it's close to home and I'm trying to find a great sandwich joint.  Showed up for a late lunch to-go around 3pm and ordered the Rajin Cajun specialty sub.  I got home opened the to-go box and was surprised to find my specialty \""sub\"" on a cheap ass hamburger bun?!?!  Not only was my sub on a hamburger bun, but a soggy bun at that; half the bread fell off making a huge mess.  \n\nI gave two starts because the combination of ingredients worked well together, even though I definitely wasn't wowed by it either.  The french fries were pretty tasty too.\n\nBottom line, I won't be back."
0,"I thought the buffet was ok, nothing spectacular.  For the cost, I expected a bigger selection.\n\nThey only had 4 pasta dishes which all tasted the same, bland and overcooked.\n\nThe meat station had only 3 different carving stations which were a little dry and unseasoned.\n\nI am not a seafood eater but that station seemed to have a nice selection and the the lines were long which told me it must have been pretty good.\n\nThe sushi and dessert stations were the best and had the most variety.\n\nIt was worth trying it out but I doubt I would return."
1,"Had dinner last night here from a recommendation from Chowhound. All in all a solid Chinese restaurant in Chinatown Montreal. We ordered the Lobster Ginger for $25. I thought this was extremely tasty, although hard to eat (lobster generally is). The lobster seemed large though and generous portion! We really enjoyed the Mongolian beef. Cooked well, great thick sauce and a nice addition of vegetables. For appetizer we had dumplings in peanut sauce which were good."
0,"BB King ought to be ashamed to have his name attached to a place like this.\n \nYea I knew going in not to expect much, I DID read the reviews this time. But the group I was with \""raved\"" about their experience a few days before and they had a coupon, and you know they saying: majority rules..... \n\nSooooo where's everyone?!??!?! I mean the place was practically empty, I'm NOT putting 2 on a 10! Out of the whole establishment, there were three tables (including mines) that were in use. Not even one person sitting at the bar! That's not good...\n I ordered something simple a fried catfish po'boy. It was good but the fries are horrible! \nThey even had the nerve to try to set the ambience by diming the lights and putting candles on the tables. Turn the lights on so folks can know that you're open and they'll come in. DUH!\n\nNot coming back and not recommending......Sorry BB."
0,"This is why Koreans should never make sushi... Fish not fresh at all, poor presentation, I would never go back there again."
1,"So, overall, the food here I've had has been really good. I will say though that if you go to Crane Alley, it's not as cheap as some of the other area restaurants (esp. not the alcohol). Another thing my friends and I noticed is that if you get appetizers, they normally give you way more dipping material (hummus, spinach and artichoke dip, etc.) than you can use up with the pita provided. You will get charged extra if you ask for more pita.\n\nThey always have a nice selection of beverages, particularly beers, but there's a cocktail list as well (again, just plan on it being pricey). If fresh and local is important to you, they also sometimes have menu items made from products of sellers you might see at Market at the Square in the summer. In the end, it's a great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside in the evening with your friends in the actual alley part of Crane Alley."
0,Chalk up another one for this place being awful. Poor service. I order the monthly special and get charged full price. Not friendly at all. I just live so damn close it's hard to resist. I guess I will just have to quit Subway for a while.
1,"I feel funny leaving a review for Panda Express, but I was so pleased with the quality of the food that I feel this is deserved. If you go during lunch or dinner, the food is always hot and fresh. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. Their staff is also very friendly.\n\nNaturally, I usually get Orange Chicken and it's awesome!"
0,"I have been a patron of this establishment for many years. My brother is a dj in vegas and I always refer this place even when he has his friends stay at cosmopolitan but after my last experience I will never stay and I will never refer this establishment to my friends.\n\nI arrived at the Encore and felt the usual excitement of Vegas and I was stoked because I love the red decor and the smell of their air fresheners. I was greeted by the front desk as usual checkin was smooth. After I got into the room I wanted a shower... that was until I saw blood all over the damn shower. I chose to skip the shower and ask for them to fix the issue. The front desk said they would send someone up. After about an hour and a half they finally sent someone to clean the windows....yes I said windows. I had to specify the shower is what needed to be cleaned because there was blood. I left the room and when I came back the room smelled so strongly of bleach I didn't want to stay in it. I left and came back decided to shower and the blood was still all over the place. Since it had been now a day since showering I had to stand on the bench to avoid contact with the blood.\n\nI wish it got better but it did not. I was visiting my best friend for his birthday and we decided to have a few drinks in the room and talk as it had been a while since we had spoken and a security guard by the name of Anthony stopped at the door to let us know we needed to quiet down because we had noise complaints. We had no music or anything out of the ordinary and he said he didn't hear anything but was instructed to ask us to quiet down. He came for a second time and said this is your third warning and your friend must leave. I asked who I needed to speak with to handle the issue. Anthony said to speak with the casino manager, that would have been helpful if that person was available but I had to speak with the front desk manager who said if I didn't quiet down she would have to kick me out....\n\nAfter I left vegas and submitted my complaint via the email survey it took 3 weeks to get a response and they said my feedback was important and had been sent to management... 2 months later I am posting this review, I gave them ample time to respond to me and I still have not heard from them other than their spam post mail with offers to stay with them. \n\nDo not waste your valuable and hard earned money here. They do not treat their customers with respect. Do not be fooled. Stay at the Aria, I already booked there and feel way more welcomed by them I was assigned a personal concierge and a direct line to her office and this is only my first time booking there/. I will post my review of the Aria soon which I am sure will be much better than BLOOD all over my bathroom and being threatened to be kicked out for talking to a friend in my room that I paid for."
1,"We've stayed at the El Cortez quite a few times because it's cheap, right downtown, and great for people watching. \nThis is how I like Las Vegas. A little bit seedy & sketchy. Screw that fancy, gaudy, touristy stuff on the strip. \n\nI DO like a super clean and nicely decorated room though. We will stay in the Cabana Suites from now on, we were so impressed. \n\n* Friendly front desk \n* Giant glass containers of free candy in lobby \n* Double sink in bathroom \n* Fridge \n* Iron and full size ironing board \n* Comfortable bed and pillows \n* iPod dock"
1,"So I have mixed feelings about this place. It is really nice inside, not claustrophobic like some other big bars in the area, and the music is pretty good. I definitely like that it attracts a nicer classier crowd of people but that is also its downfall. This place is almost so exclusive that if you don't have a table, you wont get in (apparently they cost about $1000 min). I have been lucky enough to know people who do get tables but I cant imagine how it is for people who don't necessarily have that in. The bouncers usually don't tell anyone in line that they are only letting in people with tables and people wait around for hours thinking they are gonna be able to enter the place. I personally would never wait more than 20 minutes to get into anywhere, no place is that worth it. \n\nBiggest disappointment was the drink I ordered from the bar. The bartender didn't know what a Fuzzy Navel was and when I asked her to make me an AMF instead it was undrinkable despite her claiming she knew how to make it. She then just offered me a cup of some kind of sweet and sour juice that didn't help. The poor girl was super sweet, but she just didn't know how to make a drink, maybe she is new and bartending. \n\nHowever I will say that I haven't been to a pool party there yet but I could see how it would be amazing based on the space, and I have heard amazing things. I think this place is probably has a better pool party presence than a nightclub presence just because anyone with tickets can get into the pool parties."
1,"Rightly famous for hot, hot Mex. Yeah, I've seen cowboys cry."
0,"Beautiful rooms and views. Room service is awful. The tuna tartare was tasteless and my quesadilla was so burnt I had to send it back. The room also had a number of technical problems that the staff could not solve, such as the tv in the bedroom not functioning. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel."
1,"What the hell with this place?  I mean could it be true?  I sure as hell am not in the middle of a the dessert experiencing a mirage!  \nThis is frankly a place with a whole bunch dudes running around making GREAT pastries and my favorite Middle-Eastern desserts.  I swooned!  Granted, they didn't have Katayef but I will get over it because I ordered the Osmalieh bel Ashta and it was astronomically delicious; I didn't even pour the sugar syrup on.  There was no need to.  \n\nAlso ordered the Soujok wrap which was good but didn't knock my socks off like the dessert but then again, anything with ashta steals my heart.  I want to lay in it!  \n\n\nDon't miss out on this place.  Not the warmest but by far one of the best dessert spots."
0,"Ate at the Coronado location today.  Had the Vampiro Pastor. The marinated pork was moist and tasty, reminiscent of Chinese roast pork (char siu), it was piled high with all the typical fixins, but the grilled pineapple was what put it over the top. So yummy, there's no need to put salsa on it.  \n\nThe special cerviche that's only available Fri & Sat, was awful. Tasted more like they served it the week before. Decor could use some sprucing up and beware of the bees if you plan on dining outside. Even though the ambiance and cerviche were below average, I'd take a drive to get more Vampiro Pastor."
1,"After finding out that LaGasse Stadium is now closed to under 21, we had to quickly find an alternative. Thanks to Yelp, we \""discovered\"" First Food and Bar.  I was a bit apprehensive when arriving because of the extremely loud music but once we sat down, it was more just a background rather than usurping our conversation. \n\nIt was AWESOME!! \n\nWe had a great table where we could see the fireworks from the show at Treasure Island. Our waiter was really helpful.  None of that \""snobby look down the nose at the phat peeps.\"" He made great suggestions for us including my imaginary supermodel pal who only likes pink drinks-- got the Cotton Candy Cosmo.  There was no lag in service, with our dishes coming out hot and on time.  \n\nThe pretzel starters were just right though I'd probably would have liked one non-mustard sauce for those at the table who didn't care for mustard but they were tasty.  \n\nWe shared the Grandpa & Grandma pizzas as well as the Kentucky Fried pork.  More than enough for the 4 of us.   \n\nHe suggested the signature donuts for dessert and it was the perfect compliment.  \n\nAnd because it was \""ladies\"" night, he scored 2 free cocktails, compliments of Ketel One & Dior for us, even though we weren't participating in the around the bar action.  \n\nFrom the great table by the window, to the fast attentive service to the last crumb of dessert donut, it was a great way to introduce our friends to Las Vegas glitz and glam."
1,Best nail spa! I used to go to Mark and Amy when they were at creative nails. I was SO HAPPY that I was able to find them again! I'm incredibly picky on how I like my nails done and I can honestly say I'm  satisfied every single time I leave the salon. I can't imagine going anywhere else.
0,"We have eaten here for the last 7 years, every 3-4 months or so. The restaurant must be under new ownership and we won't be back again.\nIn all honesty, my dinner was great, but my partner ordered the 8 oz. prime rib (his usual). What was delivered looked kind of like the meat patties you get on McDonalds 99cent burgers, only thinner. Even the waitress said she'd never seen one that thin. The waitress offered to get him another one but he declined and just asked her to take it away after about 3 bites.\n\nHere's where it gets bad. The 'owner' came by and said 'I'm the owner, I can do anything I want'. Unfortunately, any admission of error or apology doesn't seem like anything he wants to do. He could have at least 'passed the cardboard thin prime rib off on a new chef', said 'I'm sorry' or 'our mistake'.\n\nSuch a shame.\n\nWe left as soon as possible. I had to leave the rest of my dinner uneaten; a nice 12oz prime rib and 1/2 lb of crab legs because I couldn't enjoy my dinner while he was sitting there miserable.\n\nWe won't be back to this Outback any time soon, and will be eating at a different one.\n\nA simple apology would have done wonders that comping his 'dinner' didn't.

0,"Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....\n\nP.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease."
0,"Portions are ridiculously huge and prices are cheap - win win!  We shared a Chicken Fried Steak breakfast which was pretty darn tasty.  I wasn't very impressed with the pancakes or biscuits, although I certainly ate them anyways.  The steak was tasty, however and the gravy was tasty.  I took advantage of Yelp's check-in offer for a free pastry, but was disappointed in my bear claw.  It was no better than one I'd pick up at a grocery store's bakery.  You know it couldn't have been amazing if I only took two bites of a pastry! \n\nIf you're in need of a standard, cheap diner-style breakfast... go check it out! But if you crave something above typical diner-style fare, keep looking!"
0,"Okay, so my sister-in-law and her husband were in town and were craving a little bbq...  I made the mistake of thinking this place was \""Memphis BBQ\"", like from \""Down Home with the Neeleys\"".  OOPS.  Definitely not.\n\nBy the time we realized it, it was sort of too late to leave, and everyone was starving so we gave it a shot.\n\nWe started with the sampler app platter.  Biggest pile of fried stuff I'd ever seen.  I'm pretty sure they just threw the onion strings and pickles in the fryer at the same time, then poured them on the potato skins, so everything had a interesting fried, bacon, sour cream flavor.  Highlight was the wings, which were NOT fried...  tender, not oversauced, generally above-average.\n\nThe ribs (both baby back and St. Louis) were mediocre at best.  WAY over-smoked, sort of overcooked.  My husband said they tasted like kielbasa.  I don't think anyone at the table disagreed.  The funny thing is, you get your choice of sides...  My husband and I got steamed veggies (you have to save calories somewhere), and, it turns out, the portions of the \""good-for-you\"" stuff are like half of the other stuff (creamed corn, mac and cheese, baked beans, fries).\n\nThis place is a definite \""not recommend\""."
0,blush is a cool place to hang out.. idk if it's a lounge. felt like it.. but with a club crowd? there's not enough places to chill and a million ppl walking around and around each other..   music was very typical vegas which isn't a favorite of mine but i deal.. and overall.. drinks f*'d me up... so maybe paying the price is worth it?   idk.. it's real pretty inside though..
1,"Had  dinner before Celine Dion show.  Waiter was great and was very knowledgable about the menu.  He even did a good job trying to expain the menu in Spanish to a couple sitting next to me.  \nOrdered the blue corn pancake with duck appetizer and the pork tenderloin as the main.  Both dishes were amazing.  My only \""complaint\"" was that the sauces for both dishes were the same, but was very tasty.  \nA very relaxed and elegant experience.  Worth the $$ to dine there for a special occasion."
0,"After a 12 hour day of driving our group arrived at 11pm to discover that the hotel had oversold, despite pre-calling to confirm the booking and room allocations. This resulted in the hotel trying to fit 6 of us into 3 single rooms (having booked 3 twin share rooms), with a cot bed that obviously didn't fit. The last of our group got into their rooms at 1am with people sleeping on a 2-seat sofa. They offered us individual rooms the following day and then charged for all but one, despite being apologetic they would not back down on charging us for THEIR mistake. The hotel has not returned e-mails or calls, as a group we stay at hotels all over the world and this has by far been the most appalling for customer service. The hotel itself was ridiculous, terrible decor, very cold rooms and cheap furnishings, would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
0,"Although it is not a bad hotel, it definitely doesn't deliver the Vegas experience.  Not a lot of young people, more of an older crowd who just wants to gamble and chill. You can take the shuttle to the strip, but it stops pretty early. They have a TGI Fridays which is always good, bowling, theater, and other stuff. But like I said, it doesn't really feel like your in Vegas when at Sams Town."

0,"Needed to drop off a script before heading to a yoga class. Should take less than 5 minutes, right?  I pulled up into the drive-thru pushed the button for service then I sat and waited for 15 min.  I didn't want to go in as I had my skimpy yoga clothes on. I then called the store from outside and as someone answered the telephone a young man came to the window and said \""I'll be with you in minute\""the walked away.  I told the man on the phone nevermind  someone is helping me then waited another 10 min. I had to leave to make my yoga class in time. So frustrating. I've been going to this Walgreens for a couple years now and have always tolerated their lack of good service, but now I think mail order prescription is the way to go. Delivered right to your house. Times are changing and options are growing walgrens pharm need to accommodate the busy consumer or they will be finding other resources."
1,"3.5* \n\nDATE: Sunday, December 16, 2012 - Tuesday, December 17, 2012\nROOM TYPE: New Grand King\nLENGTH OF STAY: 2 nights\nRATE: $63.20/night after taxes @ http://hotels.com (Resort fee paid for at check-in.)\n\n___________________________________\n\n\nWe booked this hotel the same day we left for Las Vegas and were happy to have found something reasonably priced. Our expectations were rather low since we were used to staying at the newer, nicer hotels in Las Vegas but we were pleasantly surprised by how modern the rooms were and what a nice job they had done with the renovations. Definitely better than other hotels of it's class including the Mirage and the Treasure Island. I'd say the same about the Hard Rock as well but each time I've stayed there, I've been upgraded to the King Suite in the HRH All-Suite Tower.. which is, of course, not a fair comparison.\n\nWe checked in at 2am, so there was no line. The check-out process was easy and the simplified with the availability of a stack of cards next to a check-out box by the elevator.\n\nAs is the case with many of the older casino resorts in Las Vegas, be prepared for a bit of a trek between the self-park lot to the room."
0,"Mystery meat and velveeta cheese breakfast burrito, served by employees obese from their own fare, guaranteed to scald your mouth and make you sick."
1,"Great little place at CityScape. Simple menu. Subway-style build your own pizza and it cooks in minutes before you. While you wait, the artwork on display is a nice concept, as you realize the art is actually for sale by local artists in need. Dining here is a great spot for a good pie and to enjoy and even purchase some artwork if you're in the market."
1,"I just had the most refreshing lunch at Essence Bakery.  I don't know why I waited so long to try it, but I'm so glad I finally did.  Absolutely crave-able!\n\nI had the Mediterranean Platter.  The grape leaves were so delicious and I really liked the current and pine nut twist in theirs.  The  hummus and bread were top notch as well and the Greek salad was perfectly zesty.  Seriously, the Mediterranean Platter isn't exactly fancy, but it is so good and very satisfying if you aren't looking to stuff yourself.  The ingredients were fresh and had the best flavor.  I also ordered a side of the Spanakopita because I was indeed looking to stuff myself!  Not a fan, I wouldn't order it again.  It tasted too much like quiche and I don't really love quiche.  It was also a bit soggy for my taste.  That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, I wish I could give it 4.5.  My coworker had the Ham, Cheese & Jalape\u00f1o Croque-Monsieur and that looked delicious, I will have to get that next time. \n\nTo finish it off, I had to get dessert.  I couldn't pass up their box of miniature treats.  All delicious, this is a MUST.  The macaroon was to die for and I thought I hated macaroons."
0,"Dear Cafe Boa,\n\nI stopped by a little over a week ago to order catering services for an event I had yesterday for 30 people.  I was dismissed by the hostess as you were too busy seating people for dinner.  \n\nSaddened by your complete lack of interest, I left my name and number with the hostess for someone to contact me.  Alas, you never called. \n\nI just wanted to send you a little thank you...\n\nSince you never called, I had the event catered by Postino Winebar. The event was a fabulous success, everyone loved the food and will be visiting Postino for many dinners and lunches to come.\n\nNow that I know how attentive, reasonably priced and easy to work with Postino is, they will be catering all of our events for 2010.  \n\nWithout you, I might have never found them.\n\nHugs and Kisses,\nJim\n\nUpdate: The owner/manager has since emailed me saying the service issue would be rectified.  Having dined here many times before, the service is indeed usually much better."
1,The bagels and sandwich we had were good.  The menu was a little confusing. The service was quick and the prices were reasonable.
0,"We tried this place hoping to find a good Chinese spot, but left disappointed with very mediocre Chinese food.  We had General Tso Chicken (1/5) and Hunan Chicken (3/5). We also had spring rolls (2/5), wontons(0/5), and hot & sour soup (1/5). The only decent thing was the Hunan Chicken. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back."
1,"I went there couple times already. Personally I think it's a very good good place to hang out with co-workers and also close to where I work (as my part time job)!\n\nThey have one security guard check ID before enter the bar area; then you will see a full bar in front of you with 2-3 TVs on each side. If you want avoid smoke or group of ppl, maybe you should turn left, they have couple sofa down there; or turn right if you want quiet and eat something here (because they provide 1/2 off on pizza after midnight and 1/2 on all the drinks, very very value).\n\nI love their nachos, especially steak!!!!!! Highly recommend!!!!!\n\nEasy parking + open 24 hrs + looking for DANNY ( I like his service very much)...... = enjoy a night!"
1,"Funky restaurant, great food!  My wife and I have been dreaming about the chopped salad.  Remarkable!"
0,"In a word, yuck.  My husband and I went here when I was pregnant and craving some Pad Thai.  We had been there a few times before when it was Mama Fu's.  The new owners didn't really change to layout or decor and honestly, unless you looked outside to see the new sign, you couldn't really tell it was a different/new restaurant.  \nI will say the staff was very friendly and greeted us warmly when we entered the restaurant.\nWe went on a Friday night and there were 3 couples in there-including us.  Perhaps it was a slow night, or perhaps we just hadn't gotten the memo??\nSo, to my meal.  I ordered Chicken Pad Thai.  It was maybe the worst Pad Thai I have ever had.  They put French's Onions - like the kind on top of the green bean casserole at Thanksgiving - on top of the Pad Thai.  Huh?!?!  Why in the world would they do that?  Also, I've never seen tofu quite like the kind they put in this dish.  It was rubbery, slippery and just plain gross.  Needless to say we will not be going back.\nIt may be a bit more expensive, but Thai Taste is still the best Thai food in town, hands down."
1,"I had the biggest steak I've ever eaten here last summer...  and it was delicious.  I just couldn't stop eating, although I knew I'd pay for it later (I couldn't eat steak again for a couple of months, but it was worth it!)  I had the 20 ounce \""Lou's Cut\"", and it was amazing, perfectly done, a really nice steak!  We also had a lobster with the dinner, that given its weight (it was HUGE!), must have been around my age (36).  Very expensive meal, especially when you factor in wine.  Very atmospheric, in an old converted warehouse style space, close to Montreal's New Forum (home of Le Canadien), definitely recommended for \""power\"" lunches and dinners.  I would totally go again, but I would prepare for the experience by not eating for a few days ahead of time.  Recommended!"

1,"I am a vegetarian and they have a number of creative choices for me on a dedicated vegetarian menu. I had Cedar Plank Roasted Tofu with Carrots and Roasted Red Potatoes and it was very good. The tofu came with a mango/jalape\u00f1o chutney that spiced up the tofu nicely without being too hot. Service was attentive. I will say that at 6:45 on a Wednesday evening the place was packed - and quite noisy to the point where it was difficult to carry on a conversation. By 7:30, the bar crowd had thinned out and the noise level was acceptable."
1,"If Heaven doesn't have Snoh then it is no place for me.\n\nThe staff are friendly and are helpful to new customers when picking out a flavor. The decor is really interesting and gives to the unique atmosphere and vibe. I love they display local art. \n\nI get the taro flavor with condensed milk and mochi balls. It is like angels are in your mouth. My friends were talking as I was eating Snoh and I paid no mins. No conversation was important enough to distract me from the taste. \n\n\""Hey, Britt..... I need to share my innermost thoughts about a very intense topiic that may change my life..\""- Friend\n\n*evil glare*** \""No....\""   *shoves Snoh in mouth***"
0,"Terrible customer service. Called ahead to make sure truck was there and when we got there they gave us a larger one that personal auto coverage won't cover. Said only A truck was guaranteed, not a specific size. Told me if I cancelled now would be a $50 charge. Will not be back with haul next door.\n\nRevised to one star. Came to return my truck. They surrounded my car so it can't get out. Called the number on the receipt they said there's nothing they can do until tomorrow. Calling police next. Insane!"
0,"If I was teacher, I'd be the one that starts you off with 100% and you can keep it, or lose it.  There is nothing to earn.  I review similarly.  You start off with 5 stars, you keep them or lose them. \n\n-1 Star: The food was not delicious even by bar standards. I ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. The breading was disgusting and flaking off.  My friend order the chicken tacos, which tasted good, but she ended up with food poisoning later in the day :(\n\n-1 Star: The service. As mentioned above I ordered the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce. The server asked me what heat I wanted and I inquired, \""How hot is hot?!\""\n \""OMG! Hot is really really hot!  I wouldn't recommend it\"" \nSo I settled on the medium. Turns out we have different definitions of hot and when my chicken tenders with sauce on the side arrived I tasted nothing but bland chicken. Completely flavorless. I didn't want to be a huge ass and send my food back because the server was so completely off with her suggestion so I just asked for a side of hot sauce..........................let each of those periods represent a minute that went by without hot sauce and without acknowledgment. Finally she came by and I again asked about my hot sauce.  She rolled her eyes and kind of huffed something unintelligible (obviously inconvenienced) and started talking to the table next to us..........finally, after about 30 minutes between first requesting hot sauce and receiving, my cold chicken tenders received their compliment. Yes, the restaurant was busy, it was a typical AFC game day. Typical game day, much less busy than I've seen in 100 other sports bars, including ones I've worked at, so sympathic I am not. If your servers can't handle it, staff more on game days. How many people want a job these days? \n\n-1 Star: The bill. It is a sports bar with multiple games running all day and without prompting and still a half our beers left, our bill was brought to us. I would have easily done another round but with the amount of time everything was taking and the subtle hint to close out, we decided maybe we should take our business elsewhere. \n\n-1 Star: They changed our game to the pregame of another game which without sound, is pretty much was just 2 guys sitting at a desk talking on mute.  I get that this happens at sports bars and I thought the group of 5 guys next to us much have requested it.  Then I realized they were also pissed off about the channel change!  So, why unprompted (no other tables could see that tv) they change a live game to a pregame with no sound, I will never understand.\n\nSo we are down to 1 Star.  I would've have given zero if I could've.  The final insult to injury...\n\n-1 Star: Extra sauce charges. This is pretty trivial, which is why I don't understand, after waiting 30 minutes for wing sauce the waitress didn't comp the $.50. I know how the restaurant game works. You go to the kitchen and ask for a side of hot sauce, especially after you screwed up and took forever.  It does not have to go through the computer. $.50. I ended up being charged for 2 sauces, the medium, which I didn't touch and the hot, which took forever. I would've talked to the manager and got it comped but I decided to take it out of the tip instead...its all the same dollars and cents to me honey so upcharge all you want. \n\nI should say I've been to a bunch of other Zipps in Phoenix: Greenway, Via de Ventura, Indian School/36st, never had any issue. They are 3/4 star establishment, good places to drink beer, each average bar food and enjoy a game.   I don't know what it is about this Zipps--the management, staff training, complete lack of customer service. Never will go back.  If you aren't a regular you will have a TERRIBLE experience like I did. Drive the 4 miles to Greenway/64thSt or Via de Ventura, you'll be much better off."
1,"Love Boba Tea, each time I come to Vegas I get one. They have a lot of flavors to choose from, my favorites are the mango and peach. I must say each time I've gotten a different kind and can say they've all been good."
0,"Took 45 mins to get our food (and it wasn't even busy at all).\nThe only thing the waitress had to say was that the cook probably just lost my order (like no big deal).\nThe waitress suggested the wet ribs, but forgot and she brought me dry ones instead.  She also totally messed up my wife's order as well.\nNot sure if this is their usual way of treating customers, but it was our first time...and definitely our last.  I can deal with the mistakes, but not the bad service or poor attitude displayed by staff."
0,"I'd rather give no stars, but oh well.  Went in last year and got all new tires with warranty. About 2 months ago, got a flat and got it easily replaced. About a month later another tire had a leak. Took in for a replacement, and Yoko doesn't make my tire anymore. Had to wait a week for a new different size tire...? And then when we took the car in, was told that my tire had already been patched up and since it wasn't listed in the \""history\"" in the computer, they couldn't give me my tire for free and had to pay $160. Told them never mind. And they stole the key lock to my rims! And when I called in asked, they told us they had an extra key and didn't know who it belong too. So we now have a rim key that doesn't even fit. Had to go to the dealership to buy a new one. Such a waste of time for something I had a warranty on."

I just moved back to Chandler and I will never go back to this pizza joint."

I went to lunch here with a friend and between the two of us it was $28+ dollars. Way too much money for a fast food  hamburger stand. For that price, I could eat at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. The service here sucks too, I was gambling around 4AM and went up to the counter. The guy cooking did not even acknowledge me.  So I just left. There are way better hamburger places than this dump!\n\nLast great hamburger stand my A$$!!!!!!!!!!! --Very disappointed"
0,"I signed up for Yelp specifically to give this review.  If I could give zero stars, I would.\n\nI've had the opportunity to stay in many luxury hotels in the past, and although there's been a fair share of hotels that have not lived up to their name/hype, Trump definitely takes the cake as far as crappy service and hideous accomodations.\n\nI stayed there for 2 nights with three other girls to celebrate a bachelorette party.  My friend had booked 2 adjoining suites through www.hotels.com and since I was flying in 2 hours earlier, she called the hotel and put my name on the reservation.  Needless to say, when I got there, my name was nowhere to be found.  When a manager was called over, he said that my friend was suppose have called www.hotels.com instead.  What the hell?  Why shouldn't you be able to call the hotel directly?\n\nI sat in the lounge for 2 hours, waiting for my friends to arrive.  When they finally did and we went to check in together, guess what?  My name had miraculously appeared on the reservations.  Of course, the SAME GIRL who tried to check me in a couple hours prior was the same one we had to deal with - and she never bothered to tell me that my name finally appeared on the confirmed reservations even though she knew I was waiting in the lounge.\n\nOther front desk nightmares: there were no adjoining rooms left but when I started to complain (loudly), suddenly one opened up.  It took the girl 20 MINUTES to check us in.  No joke - I was timing it!  When we checked out, they messed up on BOTH our bills.  And charged us a RESORT FEE PLUS TAX for each room, each night we stayed.\n\nOn to the rooms.  Talk about run-down and disgusting.  Let me just list a FEW things that were broken: alarm clock didn't work, closet door wouldn't open, remote control was broken, mattress was too small for the bed frame so our comforter kept sliding down into the huge gap at our feet, and our padlock didn't even work!  The best thing is, we got one king-size bed instead of two beds in each room.  Umm, hello?!?!  There were four of us checking in!!!!\n\nThe \""best\"" part of the stay?  Complaining (in a VERY long email) to the general manager and having her offer us a \""good rate\"" at our next stay and refunding only our resort fees.  Please!  Like I would ever stay at your poor excuse for an establishment again."
1,"Incredibly amiable owners, unique menu selection made fresh by experienced cook. Went in hungry and (after being kindly offered a sampling of all delicious side options) left completely satisfied with a full plate sticking to my ribs: pork cordon-bleu, mashed potatoes, creamy beet salad, sweet green beans, just-right sauerkraut and some lovely gravy (see picture)."
0,"Ok let me start by saying that I've always loved Grazie and think the pizza is delicious and authentic to pizzas you can find in Naples, but over the years this place has just flat out gone down hill. Went there on a Saturday night and the place was fairly empty, which is odd since it's in old town Scottsdale. The pizza we ordered (just a basic margarita) took 45 minutes to arrive and to top it off, it was undercooked. This is when things got interesting. We told the waitress that the pizza was bad and she informed us that the pizza cook had gotten so drunk that they had to send him home so out pizza had been cooked by the salad prepper. She then offered to take half off the pizza. We were upset, but by this point were also kind of amused by it all and honestly appreciated the girls honesty. As we were leaving we noticed the owner sitting at the bar watching football. He didn't even acknowledge us. You would think in a restaurant that is clearly struggling (empty on a otherwise busy Saturday night) that the owner would have at least tried to do some damage control and talk to us. But no. He clearly doesn't care if his own restaurant succeeds or fails. So why should we? So with that we won't be back again. Which is sad cause it's been a fave of mine for past 5 years."
0,"Service, food, atmosphere was blah. Won't be back."
0,"Our original plan was to a steakhouse across the street form our hotel. But when we went to check out of the hotel, the clerk gave us 2 free buffet coupons. It was our last day and we said why not give it a try it's free.  After eating there i felt like it was a waste of room in my stomach.  Food was below average by Vegas standards. You get better food at Old Country Buffet."
1,This would be 5 stars but the service was not what I expected.  When you drop $1000 on what is arguably a culinary journey that should be on every foodie's bucket list I would think service would be stellar (not so much).  The food...the cheese cart...the desert cart...amazing.  \n\nIf you call the Hotel they will send a complimentary limo and walk you through the exclusive MGM mansion on the way to the restaurant.
0,Ran into this place after no. 1 Boba was closed just to get some milk tea boba. Let's just say I will never go back to this place. The service was terrible the guy at the register was not very friendly and was rude to me. It's a shame because the boba was good and at a decent price but because of the way I was treated I will never come back here.
1,Got an eye exam here today and had an overall good experience. The staff was really nice and helpful. The only downfall was the wait. Saw the doctor an hour after checking in. I know there is always a wait for these type of doctor visits but I feel like an hour is a little ridiculous.
1,"This place is great for kids and adults! The park itself is not too big but it is scenic. There's a large lake in the middle and around it there are paths to run on or walk your dog. The lake is filed with ducks! Rental bikes are a must! So much fun. This location it's also good for a picnic. There's plenty of benches to sit on, there's a basketball court and a softball field for kids to play. Every time we have visited this park it has been packed with people. Most of the time the softball field is occupied by youngster teams. One of our visits consisted of a study date but it was too loud to focus on the study material since there's children running around all the time. Overall it's a great park and it's always clean and neatly kept. It's a great location for a little nature date outside the city."
1,"My new favorite. Although, I think the food is overpriced and the long lines unbearable. Despite the hype around this restaurant, I think the food and experience deserve the kudos. \n\nMy yelp \""tag line\"" is Erika \""waits in no line\"" Keenan. I hate waiting in line. And I don't wait in line. I pride myself in being a person that doesn't get sucked into hype. I guess that's why it took me so long to try the Barrio Cafe.  Don't make the same mistake. \n\nParenthesis to my review and to help add a little background:  My mother is from Central Mexico (Born in Leon, Juanajuato and raised in Mexico City). She even owned her own Mexican restaurant in upstate New York. This food reminds me very much of what I grew up with -- but adds a twist (I hesitate to call it gourmet-ish) that is what must create the buzz. \n\nThe location is not sexy -- which is another reason why I loved the experience. (Not the best reason to choose a restaurant, but one that always adds extra appeal to my decision making process :) The space is small, but I didn't feel confined. The service was not rushed - but everything came out timely. \n\nRichard, the host, informed us that we would have an hour wait.  But it really only took 35 minutes (still a lifetime to someone who doesn't like to wait in lines).    But, I was celebrating my birthday with friends, so I think I was distracted and maybe a little more forgiving.\n\nMy party started with the guacamole. They add pomegranates - which I guess is the \""gourmet\"" twist.  Back East, avocados may be more expensive, but out here, no.  Not sure where the $10 price tag comes from - maybe those damn pomegranates.  A nice add - but not necessary.   Since the guac is made fresh at the table, you can always ask to omit the pomagranates, or any of the additional incredients for that matter, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't reduce the cost.\n\nFor the main course, I enjoyed the Enchiladas Suizas and my friend enjoyed the Enchiladas de Mole. Both were incredible and I'm confident my mother would approved of the mole. My friend and I both agreed we loved the Enchiladas Suizas best though. (By the way, we had to take part of our meals home and, for the record, the reheated well when we had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.) \n\nI do think the food is a pricey (especially considering what I remember my mother charging in New York for the same dishes -- well ok -- she never served pomegranates in the guacamole). \n\nBut, overall I honestly think this is a great place - and I'm so proud Phoenix has someplace that actually services central Mexican food (there's more to Mexico than a double flour tortilla with cheese in the middle or a burrito). \n\nFor another Mexican restaurant - without the hype, the gourmet twist, or the price tag, try Tortas la Presa on 24th St."
0,"I/we have eaten at the Chop several times in the past year and any time we sit elsewhere besides sitting at the bar, our service has been horrible. I hate asking the waiter/waitress to refill my water or coffee cup over and over again, especially when the restaurant is charging you $12.00 for a martini. On a positive side, historically the food has always been excellent. Last night after sharing a few appetizers, my wife and I shared a fresh sea bass dinner for $29.50, which was very tasty. However, for $29.50 (which I thought was priced high to begin with) you would think the total size of the serving would be larger then about 4-5 ounces. I believe our days of dinning at the Chop has come to a halt."
0,"I Had been visited 3 times in the last 3 months. problem persist.\nThe typical, unplug, and plug the router. \nThey even sent me new router after multiple calls.\n\nI pay for 10 Mbps, get 0.76!! why? their infrastructure (cables) are old , not well mantained. \nThey ask you to be at home from 8 to 12 (becuase you have nothing better to do right?) and they come at 1:30pm!  then they leave without saying anything.... and the first time they even sent a \""consultant\"" not a century link technitian... so when he found the problem he had to call a technitian... that time took about 4 days for a problem to be solved.."
1,"I have been back many times, even brought others with me. They even are craving it too!\n\nI still say the burger is perfect. Exactly the way I \""would\"" cook it. \n\nI alternate the pulled pork and the burgers. \n\nThe huge tater looks soo good!"
0,"Well let me tell you. We  have stayed here twice before and had a very nice stay. This time was so different!   We got here no problem with check in. Got a good deal for staying here before. Paid a low price for one night, second night free. When we got to our room...very nice until I smelled smoke. I called the front desk to complain that I specifically asked for a non smoking room and there was an obvious smoke odor. She told me no problem will send someone to spray room to purify smell. That took 1 1/2 hours for someone to do that who was spraying for 5 seconds then leaves. It did help but we could still smell faint odors of smoke. At this point I didn't want them to come back to use an air purifier if the sprays didn't help. Had a great evening with my husband eating out and having fun...here in town to celebrate our 22nd anniversary.  Next morning,  left the room at 10 am, went out for the day, come back @4pm so we could get some rest then get ready to go to the top of the world restaurant and celebrate our anniversary.  We notice the need service sign we put on the door when we left was still there. We walk in and no one has come to clean our room! Very upset at this point.  I call and complain again...seriously  we were gone 6 hours and our room wasn't even cleaned? ???? I feel that is more than enough time for some one to clean up our room. I told them..forget it! Just bring me towels and toiletries...and someone actually came by in 10 minutes. What upsets me the most is that no one showed any care or concern. .they were just so matter of fact. No one said Sorry!!! I ended up canceling our reservation at the top of the world restaurant.  I spoke with Will who was the only one who gave me his name without asking,  offered to give me a later reservation and actually cared! I just said no thanks just need to cancel. I have been to the top of the world restaurant twice before and the staff and food were fabulous!  After all is said and done. ...what matters most is that I'm here in Las Vegas with my best friend and hubby of 22 years....just have to make the best of it. One thing for sure, will never stay at the Stratosphere again!"
1,This place is the absolute BEST to purchase a bike! I have been searching for a bike for a while now and every place I have gone to have not been NEAR has helpful as Glenn. \nThe one guy in the shop helped pick me a bike for what I needed and Glenn fit me perfectly to the bike. They also helped me with the bike rack on my car and changed my bike saddle for me! Ohhhh and they gave me the best price on the bike and accessories!!!  Wonderful service. Absolutely will go back! ... Can't wait!
0,I had a non smoking floor yet we can smell the smoke in our room. Our clothes smell like it our hair. Shower was dirty. They didn't turn our phone on so I had to use my cell phone to call the front desk. I will not stay there again. I do like that it was across the street from a Thai place and a nice bar/lounge.
1,"If you like Cherry Blossom in Central Phoenix, you should thoroughly enjoy it's counterpart, Eastwind. Eastwind is one of my lunch go to spots because it is delicious, fairly-priced (you can get some of the same dishes as Cherry Blossom for cheaper) and has a friendly staff. \n\nMy list of must tries is simple. If you like Japanese curry, you gotta try the curry, rice and chicken katsu dish; it's fantastic and filling. The udon noodle soup is next on my list and is especially good if it's chilly outside; and I can't forget to say how good it is with shrimp tempura added to it. The best part about it is that it doesn't feel heavy or bog you down after eating it; you leave feeling re-energized. Last but not least is the lunch bento. Good lawd, it's scrumptious! Think of it as a sampler of sorts: you get your fish, your katsu, some miso, a salad and some rice. For $9 that's a lunch that'll fill you up and keep you full the rest of the day (unless you're not human of course, you pesky alien, you).\n\nGo here, eat the food, be nice to the staff and be prepared for a pleasant experience. It's a great place for a small group if you're into good atmosphere and Japanese cuisine."
1,I truly enjoy getting my nails done at happy nails. The ladies that work here are all very nice and each time I have been in they have plenty of nail techs to preform services.  Pedicures and manicures I have had here are always good and worth every cent.
0,"Our server was fine and the food is just ok.  The manager, Adam is an a** in my opinion.  He could use a fresh course of customer service."
1,"I see a lot of negative reviews here on this business but I've had good experiences with them, sort of.\nI went in to ask about getting the carbs on my bike rebuilt. The cost was prohibitive for me but some guy, my apologies for not knowing his name , asked me what year my bike was. I told him and he said they won't even work on my bike because it was too old. Huh? He explained to me about how with bikes than ten years tend to have things break quite easily and end up costing them more to fix than they make. Ok, I can understand that.\nHe then tells me that when I bike has been sitting for a long while and the gas goes bad that the thing to do is run some SeaFoam through it and that will probably bring the bike back to it's original performance. Cool. \nSo he says they won't work on my bile but tells me the easy way to fix it myself. That rates pretty high in my book.\n\nThe second incident was when I went in for a clamp that I lost. He, same guy, asked me what it went to and I told him the air cleaner. He tells me that they don't have a clamp like that but I can use a zip tie to re-attach that hose to the air cleaner. I think that's some stand up advice. He could have easily told \""Sorry, ain't got one\""  and let me walk away bummed but he helped me out with some mechanic advice.\n\nIn summary, I've never had my bike worked on by them so I can't comment on that kind of experience but have been given good advice from them."
0,"I like the open areas outside (kind of a wrap-around patio), but other than that, there's really no point. The food is quite awful. The happy hour specials are so-so. The drinks are bleh. But I do appreciate the live music. And the bartenders can be friendly on the right day at the right time. So um, sit outside near the front entrance, get a beer, and enjoy the live music and Fremont St. people-watching."
0,"Upon arriving on Father's Day understanding\nthere would be a wait, no problem.\nWe usually come here very often because it's \nclose not bad food needs an uplift to the menu\nitems new variety, but when we were seated \nour waitress who we know from the old location\nwas not pleasant seemed like she could care \nless about her customers.\nWe ordered the Tommy B omelette and 2 eggs\nbenedicts.

1,My first time staying at the Rio and I just was amazed at how great the service was. Yes this place looks like it is still in the 80's with that ugly color on the outside but the rooms in the inside weren't bad at all. \n\nGot comped rooms at the Rio a queen bed that also allowed our doggy. It wasn't a bad place to stay and I was actually really surprised! Also we got two free cute doggie bowls for our new puppy. He loved them! \n\nStayed for the weekend had a great time and everything was free what else can I ask for? :) \n\nThe only thing that I would suggest is not to valet your car because the self park seems much faster to get to the hotel. Also they do have a lot of these weird shows which half naked girls are dancing in what seems like underwear. A lot of people were looking at it. The music was good though. :) So no complaints on my end.
1,"Not fancy, but oh so good and soooo cheap! My family of 4 usually gets out of there for right around twenty-five bucks, sometimes less.  \n\nCarne asada is delicious and huge. The chile rellanos are so good. Burritos are giant and also delicious, and like another reviewer mentioned, the quesedillas are ginormous. BUT... what's really cool is that as busy as this joint is, the lovely lady that takes the orders remembers what my kids order better than I do!  And frequently we come with 2 families together, a total of 8 kids... she makes it so easy. She reminds me of my friend's son, \""that one likes his carne asada plain.\""  Gotta love it!\n\nAnother reviewer noted great food but not that clean... we're frequent customers.. 3 to 4 times a month for the last 3 years...and we've never seen it dirty in the least. Don't mistake plain for dirty."
1,"Yay, a place with real authentic home cooked food. It's a small mom and pop place where everything is made from scratch. The homemade apple cider sweetener for the tea is to die for. I just wish they were open in the evening for dinner. Great for breakfast and lunch though.\n\nThey serve up soups, salads, sandwiches and have daily specials."
1,Ask for Bond!!! He is the best in the business. I have traveled around the world and go to a lot of restaurants and I have never had anyone better than Bond!! He made our experience so magical and dreamy!!! We love Bond!!!!
1,"I came here with a friend for a quick lunch. Their lunch hours are 11-330pm? anyways, its really easy to find - its right next to sambalatte.\n\nThey have an arrangement for lunch specials. They have individual sides or u can get boxes where it comes with rice, miso soup, tempura, and whatever main dish u ordered. \n\nMy friend had gotten a sushi roll. This wasn't on the lunch special menu. They don't have all the rolls they would have on the dinner menu, only a portion. The price they offer for the roll during lunch time however is the same as the dinner price. \n\nThe miso salmon is really good! They glaze the salmon with light miso sauce and the portion of the fish is good too. You can ask for brown rice instead of the white rice- no extra charge.\n\nThe only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because they didn't have curry katsu. They had Japanese curry rice as an option and katsu as an option- but not together. I thought it was odd that a Japanese place didn't have the combination of both. I'm not sure if the dinner has it or not, but the lunch menu sure didn't. And if you wanted it, you have to order BOTH dishes so you would end up getting charged basically double. Booooo"
0,"Really would be a one star, except it has it's bright points (staff who try).  \n\nThe good:  Cheap.  The bad:  Old dirty, smells like a fraternity after a beer brawl.\n\nCould be a five star if you like cheap beer..."
0,"First time here, for breakfast.... Was thinking to find something else besides IHOP & Denny's ..... Obviously this place need to call Robert Irvine! Smell old , look old , oily everything you touch .... I have a chance to try anyway because of \"" good yelp reviews\"" MISTAKE!!!! Server was sooooo rude, she needs to be \""trained\"" of customer service speak abilities ..... I bet they did not see much nice dressed up people. Ok, food.... Home made potatoes were good, omelet sooooo plain! Do they have at least black pepper? Ok, 1 star for potato...."
1,"Every time I eat here it doesn't disappoint.  The Macchioni family are really hands on at this establishment as it is run by one of the sons.  It's real Tuscan fare with fun surroundings.  And the view doesn't get much better.  You have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains which really makes you feel like you've been transported from the buzz of Vegas to the quiet serenity of Tuscany.\n\nWe started our journey with the spring salad with toasted walnuts, gala apples and blue cheese crostini.  The balsamic champagne vinegarette was light and refreshing and the cheese didn't overwhelm my palate.  \n\nNext, I ordered the small ($20 for the small, $30 for large) spaghetti bolognese.  The spaghetti tasted like it was fresh made with large noodles with lots of texture, not gummy or chewy and the bolognese tasted as if its been simmered for hours.  It had the lightest notes of wine, rosemary and fresh tomatoes.  \n\nThe hubby ordered the specialty of the house which is the lamb chops.  They were perfectly cooked and the spice rub on the outside didn't overpower the meat.  \n\nIf you are unsure what to get as the bartenders while you are waiting for your table for their recommendations.  They are knowledgeable of the menu and offer great advice.  \n\nAlso, make sure you make a reservation otherwise, its not likely you will get a table, but you can always try to belly up to the bar.\n\nTruly fantastic."
1,"We had a wonderful night here on my son's birthday. What made it so special was the great service that we had out of our waiter. Even though we were in a remote far-off corner of his outdoor patio on a chilly evening, he kept his eyes on us and we were never left wanting. [They have great heaters and they aren't afraid to use them.] The atmosphere is not as cool or charming as it could be -- I wish they'd spent a bit more to make the place look good. But, I did like the food, and that's what counts. I had a huge piece of pork tenderloin, and some great Mac 'n Cheese. While nothing is especially unique, their comfort food does just that . . . it gives you the feeling that someone who loves you just cooked you a home-cooked meal. I don't get that feeling in a restaurant very often. The next night we had dinner in another famous Phoenix restaurant (Tarbell's) and it was a let-down compared to this. When the waiter heard me reference my son's birthday, he brought out a large desert item which was enjoyed by all. A great experience! We were there on Arizona Wines night, and enjoyed a great bottle of Cochise Country white wine for half off. I like promotions like that."
0,"This wasn't my first pick for a Vegas hotel, but I was in town for a conference and the price was right at TI ($500 for 5 nights). Checked in at around 7:30pm and waited over 45 minutes in the smoky lobby. When I asked for directions to the hotel my conference was located at the staff was less than helpful. \n\nWhen I finally made it up to my room I was pleasantly surprised. The furnishings looked quite modern and nice, and I got the king sized room I requested. Upon closer inspection the room left a LOT to be desired. On the first night I discovered a crusty stain on the sheets, which obviously had not been changed. After requesting for a bed linen change, the new linens had several dark stains on them. Gross! Towels were always \""crunchy\"" - in definite need of replacement. Floors had obviously not been vacuumed in awhile and there were also suspicious white stains on the wallpaper. \n\nHotel restaurants did not look appetizing. I went for happy hour at the TI's highly rated \""Isla\"" restaurant, and while the drink was delicious their food was sub-par (they use liquid cheese on their nachos). Most of the time I ended up taking the tram to the Mirage next door for decent eats. \n\nOverall, the bargain price could not compensate for the lack of cleanliness. Next time I will definitely stay elsewhere."
1,"Love this place! The boy and I came here for brunch this past Monday, and were pleasantly surprised. The omelet bar offers made to order omelets and eggs with a variety of filling choices, which we both opted for bacon and cheese and were cooked perfectly. There are a lot of different choices, which is great if your with a group or a picky eater, everything from pizza, Mexican to Asian cuisine and sushi. I only wish we more hungry when we came here."
0,We went here for a New Years eve party. We assumed it was going to be more relaxed and mature since it was located north and away from its Old Town counterpart The place was entirely full of guys. Our group consisted of couples and it was irritating as several drunk guys kept trying to approach our significant others. I can't say I blame those guys and I felt bad for them as well since they paid a lot of money to attend this party and meet women and there were none. It eventually turned into another Scotsdale club scene. It was not classy. The dance floor was claustrophobic.
0,"Not impressed. Bought a groupon, but still paid well above what I expected to for a small pizza, app and one beer $29. All draft beer here is $6/16oz. The pretzel app was tasty, but it was simply pizza dough in a pretzel shape. Beer cheese was ok, but cost just as much as the pretzels ($3.29). The hostess staff is in booty shorts which I don't prefer to look at while eating (call me a prude haha). The vibe is trendy, but inauthentic. I was hoping for a neighborhood type feel and some good pizza - this place falls short of that.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend and won't be frequenting this place."
1,"Although expensive, it is definitely a cool experience.  We ended up purchasing the upgraded seats for Transformers in 3D. The showing was fantastic, and the service was excellent. The 3D glasses were premium quality as well.  We ended up having food and a few cocktails.  If you go this way, you could be looking at spending over $100 for the night, easily!  If prices were a little more reasonable, this would be the perfect movie experience!"
0,"Pretty much got hustled again, $83 cover charge just to be way too uncomfortable by how overpacked it is. Pretty much chest to chest everywhere you go in the club. How dare people say it is the highest rated club when you can't even move. Terrible...just terrible..."
0,"I had a black pekingese, 8lbs, 5yrs old, he is in my profile picture. He was healthy and didn't have any high or low blood levels during his yearly blood work. I took him in for a routine teeth cleaning and he had a cardiac arrest, while they were administering propofol and it took them 2 minutes to get oxygen to him.  He is a brachiocephalics dog, this I understand. This was not my first visit, this has been his veterinarian 3 1/2 years. She has put him under prior, twice. Once for a teeth cleaning and neutered. Under the circumstances, they should have had all proper equipment out and ready. However, they weren't and I no longer have my baby. \nI also have a bulldog and she was having diarrhea, so I took her in. Dr. Dagle decided that since my other dog had worms, the bulldog did, too. She gave her worm medicine, without the test results back. I  did not give her the worm medicine,  we hadn't received results. Two days later, I get a call she tested negative for worms. I no longer ever wanted to see Dr. Dagle. \nNegligence seems to happen in this office a bit too much.  I can't believe I have to give it a star."
1,"For champaign, best sushi. Very good prices for its large portions. I highly recommend this place."
0,"I tried so hard to like this place but the food--at least what I ordered--just wasn't very good.  I got the artichoke spinach cheese dip which came with flatbread and fresh cut veggies.  Sadly, the veggies (alone) were my favorite part.  A previous Yelper mentioned the tomato bisque as being something to try and I was super disappointed--it was just meh.  Wildflower and Cafe Zupas soups put it to shame.\n\nGood things?  The restaurant itself is stunning--all brand new.  Lots of attentive servers=great service.  Fancy soda machines.  Decent prices.  The smoothie bar looked cute.  Ugh!  I feel like I'm fishing here...\n\nI think I will be back again to see if I just had a bout of horrible ordering.  The breakfast menu did look promising."
0,"No value here!  $14 for a cold bowl of french onion with cheese that was not in the least melted and a very small caesar salad selected from the \""lunch combo\"" menu does not spell a \""return visit\"".  Service was slow even though there were only a few tables in the restaurant.  All food at table was uninspired at best.  Why?"
0,"YUCK!!!! I feel sick just writing this review. Yelpers you have let me down. The food was downright rotten (literally,) my Cali Omelette smelled and tasted rotten. I don't know if the egg or cheese were old or artificial. The home potatoes lacked seasoning and were extremely bland. I only ate a couple of bites and sent it back. I refused to reorder anything else, I just didn't trust this place after that. My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and the Cinnamon Roll and he enjoyed them. I had a couple of bites of the Cinnamon Roll and it reminded me of the fake Pillsbury Dough rolls. Not a Fan!!! :( If I need a Breakfast fix, I will go elsewhere."
1,"I've been to the Shout House a couple times now, on a Friday and a Saturday night.  Saturday night the place was packed, with a majority of the tables taken (or set aside for reservations) by 7:00.  Friday was a little more laid back.  I believe on the weekends the cover is $5 before 7:00, after that it is $10.  They have various special during the weeknights as well.  \n\nAlways lots of \""birthdays\"" being celebrated, and you can submit song requests (accompanied by a tip).  There always seems to be an intoxicated schmuck in the front getting a little carried away, but security seems to always be on top of things.  My go to drink has been the Big Ass Beer ($7 for the first, $5 for refills same day only).  \n\nAll in all a good place to take a group of friends for as much or less than it would cost to go to a club."
0,"Took my recently rescued dog here to be groomed.  She was nervous and new to the leash process.  A small poodle mix, all of 9 pounds.  When I walked in Bailey squatted and puddled on the floor.  The person sitting behind the desk loudly says across the room-\""Dog-peeing on my rug.\""  I looked up and said something like \""Sorry-she is scared\"".  The person said ( again loudly) \"" Dog-still peeing on my rug\"".  I turned around and left--won't be going back.  It's a pet/grooming store-not her living room.  Really?!?!"
0,"The Cosmopolitan only cares about making money! Their customer service is horrible! If I hadn't had an issue I'm sure I'd think this hotel was awesome, but it was once I needed the service of the staff that I realized the only thing this hotel had to offer was it's looks. \n\nI had an issue with booking a cabana. They tried to charge me 3x more than they originally quoted me within the same phone call and I was literally told, \""Ma'am, if you don't book at this price we can just offer the cabana to someone else who will.\""\n\nWhile at the pool, I witnessed a waitress agree to waiting on a group of males without them paying for a cabana in exchange for a 40% tip while the people in the cabana next to them complained because they had to spend a minimum of $3,000 for their cabana.\n\nAlso, 2 lights were out in our room and we continuously called for maintenance only to end our trip without ever getting it fixed because no one showed up!\n\nThey pride themselves on having Marquee Nightclub in their hotel and yet when an issue arose at the nightclub, suddenly they describe it as \""a separate entity.\"" A friend of mine had an issue at the Marquee and no one there cared to help her. So we called the hotel asking what the protocol was for dealing with situations like that which we had just experienced. The manager of The Cosmopolitan who I spoke to said, \""I'm sorry you had an unpleasant experience. That's all. What? Are you expecting me to give you a free room for the weekend to make it better? Because I'm not gonna do that!\"" Mind you, I never asked for that. I guess she just got defensive because she couldn't answer my question.\n\nEveryone is rude and had their own agenda. I'd rather stay at a hotel that has style AND OFFERS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. A cool looking hotel does not make up for horrible service. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN."
1,"Seriously the yummiest cheapest burgers in Vegas. I got a double cheeseburger and fries for $4! The service was quite good, we only had one server that got a little grumpy but it was like 11 at night so... They should open early for breakfast, they are the only Steak & Shake that don't. I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table even with all the NASCAR fans and even when we had 8 people with us. I highly recommend!"
1,"It's the oldest student union building in the world. I would highly recommend the nachos there - probably the most delicious nachos in Edinburgh. Teviot is also a good place for drink as the price there is comparatively low.\n\nKeep an eye on poster sale as well. The posters and maps there are really cheap! 4 pounds each for a large one or 10 pounds for three. I bought a British map there, whose price in bookstore is nearly 10 pounds..."
0,"First I have to admit that I often find the idea of eating ribs more exciting that the actual experience but that's me. I felt that I HAD to eat some ribs now that I live in NC, right? \n\nThis place was a drive but seeing the reviews it seemed like the best choice. Comfy hang out, good selection of beer, that's good. The bacon wrapped jalapenos were great, the smoked chicken and the mac and cheese were good but it was all downhill from there. \n\nI had the $19 combo platter. The St Louis ribs tasted real good but they were dry. The pulled pork was dry too, which is unforgivable! Amend that even the cole slaw was dry, the worst slaw I ever had. The smoked sausage tasted funky to me and the Texas brisket was non descript and none too tender either.\n\nWoopy-doo, if this is Charlotte's finest no more bbq for me"
1,Been several times.  Each time gets better.  Blows away Holsteins and even Bacchi burger (which I go to frequently).  It seriously does not get any better.  Great beer selection.  Unbelievable bun.  Incredibly knowledgeable staff.  Some of my most memorable meals of the year.  And that is saying a lot!!!  Absolute perfection!  It even tops Todd English's.  I will never mock Gordon again.  He hires and trains the right people.  \n\nI still visit Todd English's and Bacchi several times per year.  Save your time and money if you were considering Holsteins.
1,"been here dozen's of times, finally decided to review them. The food is a step above the average Italian restaurant and the Sangria blow's away any other we've tried and we've tried quite a few. The mood is good and the manager, John, makes sure you are properly taken care of from service to food quality. Try the John Cole for a tasty dessert after stuffing yourself"

0,"-Conveniently located next to Trader Joe's.\n\n-Purchase food or janatorial items in bulk...like a teeny fraction size of Costco.\n\n-Clean store.\n\n-Service...not so great. :( \n\n-Each time I have stopped in here, there is one cashier and 4-5+ customers in line (like Hobby Lobby).\n\n-Most prices are not so reasonable to lure me back.\n\n-Observed two employees chatting in the aisle, instead of opening another register to expedite customer check-out.\n\n-After deciding NOT to wait in the long one-cashier line, I left my \""potential purchases\"" near the register. Instead of opening another register to assist with checking out customers, another employee wasted no time scooping up my abondoned items.\n\n-I'm surprised that this business is still open. You get a vibe that the employees hate their job and that management is terrible."
1,"I have been coming here for about 5 years now. It changed hands a while ago and the new owners are fantastic. I have no complaints. The price for most dry cleaning is $3.25 while the price keeps creeping up, it is still under most places for price. And the quality is always great. I am always happy with how my clothes turn out."
0,"This place simply sucks, I have been here three times and it's the same experience...the staff hate their job and therefore dealing with customers, the beef or the chicken for the hot sandwiches is always pre-cooked and saved in a fridge so they just warm it up on the hot grill, which at the end is no big deal. What  I don't understand is  why they always hire employees who look like bums, tonight I was there and they still have the girl with  tattoos and piercings all over...honestly, it doesn't look very hygienic, never mind the hostile attitude from her towards the customers, if she hates her job so much then she should quit and move on to other challenges. She seems to be annoyed by the customers, doesn't even bother to look at them when shes speaking, looks annoyed  if a customer asks what  this veggie or that condiment are, she makes the pita sandwich and dumps it (literally) on the counter. That attitude could fit if she worked at a jail or at a soup kitchen, but not in a place where customers are paying for their food. The other girl at the register is a lot friendlier and more pleasant, I must admit. The only good thing about this place is that they are downstairs and close late at night, and that is the only reason why now and then I spend my money there...other than that I'd rather go Subway, which is next door, or have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at home."
1,"My husband and I came here for lunch due to a friend's recommendation.  We liked it so much we returned the next day!\n\nDay One:\nHubs - peppercorn burger and fat fries\nMe - black angus burger with peanut butter and bacon, zucchini fries\nBeers - Abita Amber, Dogfish Head Indian Brown, Dogfish Head Palo Santo Marron\n\nFor me, the best things on the menu were not the burgers, although they were tasty.  The zucchini fries were delicious and amazing - hot with a crispy coating.  As Oklahomans, where decent beer cannot even enter the borders, we appreciated the extensive and tasty small brewery beer selection.\n\nDay Two:\n\nHubs - same as Day One (not so adventuresome, or maybe he just really liked it), Black and White milkshake (vanilla ice cream, cookie dough, chocolate whipped cream)\nMe - black angus with proscuitto and mozzarella cheese, zuc. fries, \ncustom milkshake with vanilla ice cream, oreos, and caramel sauce. \n\n I rarely, and by that I mean almost never, eat to the point of pain.  The milkshake was worth it.  In fact, I was tempted to keep eating it despite feeling like I just might throw up from fullness. \n\nWe enjoyed everything we ate, had good service, and found the quality for price point to be high given the crappy overpriced offerings in the casinos."
1,Lemongrass ginger green tea is fabulous!  I got a plate with a little bit of everything!  The vegetable salad and hummus were particularly delicious. Very friendly service from Jon! I'll be back!
1,"I have to say I was impressed with this location. \n\nIt was clean, busy, and staff seemed friendly. \n\nMy only peeve was that we waited in line because they only had one register. I think they should have opened another so we didn't have to wait to pay. They had the staff to do so."
1,"The Queens Arms recently had a bit of a revamp and the place is looking rather good - it has definitely joined the ranks of decent gastropubs and left the days of being a 'traditional' boozer behind. The newly painted green exterior is inviting and I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped over the threshold; inside it's cosy due to the presence of a real fire and the books lining one of the walls are a nice touch. The menu is tempting and succinct: there are only a couple of choices for each course, so everything is well thought out, pleasantly presented and very tasty (try the fish and chips). My boyfriend is rather fussy when it comes to pubs, but this is somewhere that has us both satisfied; it's gastro enough for me and pub-by enough for him."
0,Went here on a Saturday for breakfast based in location and yelp reviews. \n\nThe restaurant by itself is very trendy and nicely decorated in a modern theme. Very simple with the menu listed behind the counter and you just order when you are ready.\n\nFor a Saturday the were less than 10 people in the place. Was really looking forward to getting our food. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the chicken salad sandwich and they brought it to our table.\n\nThe breakfast burrito did not wow me it was just average and the chicken salad sandwich looked great but was just ok. Wanted so much more with the previous reviews on yelp an d the nice restaurant and location. \n\nSorry to say that is the reason why there were less than 10 people there on a Saturday morning. Hate to say there will probably be another restaurant at this location in 6 months.
1,Update.  They have beer!!\n\nI had the Thai fried rice with a split of chicken and veges today.  I ordered it with medium heat.  Perfect!!  5 stars now!  I'll come back weekly!
1,"John's has a huge variety and a cool atmosphere. I can't wait for the warmer weather so I can sit outside on their deck! My personal favorite is the tuna tataki! Yum! The owner, John, is super personable. He always makes sure we have a great experience!"
1,"Alcohol infused shaved ice. How on earth can you go wrong with that?! These guys are awesome and they serve up a mean shaved ice. You can either get it spiked or virgin so if you hire them, both adults and kiddos can enjoy the products! I've enjoyed them at events I've attended and also hired them for my own events and they are a great addition to a party. They also offer a bartending service and they are a blast to work with! Did I mention that their shaved ice is spot on?!"
1,"I would definitely recommend this place if your pet needs to be seen urgently. The outcome can be a bit pricey and that's why I gave it one less of a star. As well as the facility not being the cleanest. We sat in a waiting room for hours with blood on the floor.\nOn the other hand... the staff is wonderful, compassionate, and quick to help as well as keeping you at ease. They all seem knowledgable which also helps leaving your friend at their care, especially if you can't be back there with them."
0,Took my truck in to get fixed with pretty minimal damage to it.  It needed a grill and some head lights replaced no engine damage.  They kept my vehicle for almost 3 weeks.  I continually got voice mails from staff members telling me one estimated pick up date and hearing something entirely different from someone else.  The staff in the office was friendly and apologetic but at some point apologies only go so far...
0,"The sign says they open at 6:30 am. At 6:32 my husband and I stopped for a coffee on our way out to work -- the bakery case was still covered, and the baristas ignored us. We asked \""What time do you open?\"" and she replied \""6 more minutes\"" then continued to ignore us with a smirk on her face. This might be a great coffee spot, but we wouldn't know. CRAPPY service - fire your lazy staff and hire someone who cares!"
0,"We were at Delmonico's & we were looking forward to having a delicious bone in filet, my mom had ordered one their before & it was wonderful. We sat down, ordered drinks then started to look over the menu to realize they were not offering a bone in file. So my dad walked to CUT to ask if they had a bone in filet & the general manager (Gianni) said yes they did. We decided to leave Delmonico & got a table right away at Cut...(which was BS because we called earlier & they told us NO seating was available until 9:30...surprisingly at 8:00 they were wide open) We sat down & 1st thing asked the server if they had a bone in filet...well he said NO, they did not! The GM lied to my dad to get us to have dinner at CUT. The GM was extremely rude & got into an argument with my father & my husband. Unbelievable! Obviously we left CUT & we went to a 3rd restaurant for the night... Morels. We walked in ask the hostess if they were offering a bone in filet, she called the head chef right away and he said yes they did. We sat outside on the patio it was a beautiful night & we watched the pirates show at Treasure Island &  we enjoy the yummy bone in filet, Morel's had great service too!! :)"
0,"Cafe Pino is the sort of place I am totally mixed on. I wanted to love it - cute, conveniently near the movie theater, serves late, broad, well priced wine list. But, my experience here was odd at best. \n\nWent with one of my friends, Meredith G., after a movie. We were never told whether to order at the counter or if we would be waited on, and we basically stood around for a while. Once we ordered, it took a while for the food to be delivered, which was odd b/c we were about the only people there. Also, the owner kept staring at us and coming by every two seconds to ask if we were \""ok.\"" This quickly went from friendly to down right annoying.\n\nThe pizza and salad we shared was tasty, but the service was a hassle overall."
1,Amazing food! My BF took me here during my first weekend trip to Charlotte and it was sooo yummy.  I had the chicken and dumplings and fried potato cakes. The service and atmosphere were really great as well. I really liked to fusion of southern cooking and cajun and the fact I could get a delicious beer to go with my delicious food!
1,Great food...I recommend the waffles with bacon and hash browns....amazing strawberry lemonade. Went on a saturday early afternoon and only had maybe a 5 minute wait...def going again
1,"So good! This was by far the best meal I had while at Vegas. \n\nMy friend's and I were doing Vegas as cheap as possibly. We decided that one night we would go to a nice restaurant for a decent meal. Can't spend all my money on alcohol and gambling. We randomly went with this place and I am glad we did. \n\nThere were three of us and we got two appetizer and two dishes to split and it was more than enough food. The waiter was really accommodating and helpful. He was also super nice. That is always a plus. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a nice meal, I definitely recommend Botero!"
0,"Came here twice during my Las Vegas stay...\n\nThe first time was for lunch.  I ordered a way overpriced hamburger.  It was good, but ridiculously expensive (just like everything in Vegas, I guess)\nEveryone in our party was amused by our asshole waiter.\n\nI just don't get why people want to go somewhere and have some loser making fun of you.  I would go elsewhere for better food and better service.\n\nAnd I ordered their expensive yard daiquiri.  DON'T BUY IT!  I didn't taste/feel any alcohol at all, after spending almost $20 on one drink.  I expect to be drunk afterwards!  What a rip off....way to spend $20 on a frozen icee.\n\nThe second time I came in at night for a drink, they were closing!  It had to have been maybe 10pm?  11pm?  They close early!\n\nGo elsewhere!"
0,"Pittsburgh has many Indian restaurants, and this one is not worth your time or money. I've visited this establishment on a number of occasions and have with each additional visit become so positively underwhelmed that I do not think I can even try it again.\n\nMy most recent visit was with my husband and another couple. The visual atmosphere is ok, though the restaurant is really dark. The music is bizarre at best and always makes for a weird sensation. I've not heard any Indian music in my last few visits and this time there was actually metal playing at one point. \n\nI'm not keen on the service either. I have a real sore spot for upsellers. I don't want to be told that I'm ordering naan or appetizers or 2 orders of something, as it makes me, the customer, have to be disagreeable with the server. I understand the tactic but believe it to be rude and untoward.\n\nLastly,--and possibly most importantly--the food is not very good. The curries are spiced but are missing something and to my palette taste bland and boring. The portion size is ok but the entrees are overpriced. To make matters worse, they somehow are able to make the driest, most bland Galub Jamun I think I've ever tasted. \n\nNothing to see here; take your taste buds elsewhere."
0,"This dry cleaner recently took over from the previous owners that I decided to stop going to because they didn't accommodate alterations on site. My daughter wanted a neighborhood cleaner to bring her Sanctuary Elements uniform to...a Diane Von Furstenberg dress that she has to have cleaned weekly. She asked me to drop off her dress so I decided to add a White House/Black Market cotton/viscose sweater to be cleaned. White House is my go-to store for all my work clothes.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the dress and sweater, my sweater was BEIGE!!! The young girl behind the counter saw my face and said \""Is their something wrong?\"" I said \""Yes, my white sweater looks like its been ruined. It was white.\"" She said \""I'm sorry, we've had trouble with the guy in the back.  I will put it back through to be cleaned again.\""  I relented.\n\nA week later I went to pick it up. Now, let me tell you. A cotton and viscose sweater has a shiny thread appearance to it. It is has a lusterous rather than matte fabric.  My sweater looked beat-up, dingy, grayed, frayed and lacked the original luster it held. Obviously, the cleaners damaged it the first time and in order to get the discoloration or polluted smog out of it they had to bleach it. The sweater recommends you use non-chlorine bleach. It has the option to hand wash or dry clean. The owner Martin happened to be the one I was greeted by upon pick up. I very calmly spoke to him and told him I was not happy. I said, \""My sweater is ruined. It's lost its white color and is quite frayed. It's not shiny anymore.\"" He said, \""I am sorry and paused.\"" I said, \""I would like it replaced.\"" He said, \""You will have to find your receipt. Bring a copy of your receipt and I will reimburse you.\"" I agreed and he asked to retain the sweater.\n\nThis sweater wasn't horribly expensive. It was $88 but i got it on sale for $66.88. I keep all my receipts and found it. I returned one week later and left off a copy of the receipt with a new clerk.  I was told I would get a call when my check was ready to be picked up.\n\nI didn't get a call back. This was a busy time for me so i finally got over there on Christmas Eve to pick up my reimbursement check. Martin was there. He said \""I am not going to reimburse you. I took your sweater to the White House/Black Market store and spoke to two sales people and the manager. I compared your sweater to another similar sweater and everyone agreed it was just like new.\"" I was flabbergasted.  I said, \""You're kidding right? You went to the store?  I'm embarrassed for you. You can't tell it has been ruined? Your clerk said that you had trouble with another work who turned it beige.\""  He said something like ... the sweater was cleaned properly and I have been reassured by the store it is in its original condition.  I don't remember what he said after that.  I can't believe a store would not stand by its customer's disapproval of their services and not make amends.  \n\nYou guys!  My sweater is un-wearable! It's off to Goodwill. I am not the kind of person to get mad at vendors. I don't complain and if you ask anyone I am usually overly agreeable and provoke a group consensus. \n\nI also am going to write customer service at White House. I find them to be a reputable company that stands behind their products. I think Martin wanted to be right instead of satisfying a customer. All over $66.88. Ridiculous!  I would not recommend this company. My daughter has told the Sanctuary to not use this dry cleaner either for their uniforms. \n\nThey have two locations. Please don't go to either one of them. at 3375 E. Shea Blvd. or 9301 E. Shea Blvd."
1,"Basically one notch above five guys burgers. Better atmosphere, and obviously a better selection of toppings, but as far as quality of food goes it's about the same."
0,"I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...\n\nI have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.\n\nThier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.  \n\nI can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.\n\nI guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better."
1,"Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. \n\nBeen intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. \n\nYou pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. \nFirst stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. \nFrom the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. \n\nMoments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. \n\nOur waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. \n\nWhile waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. \n\nThe food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. \n\nAll in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. \n\nI highly recommend Rustlers Rooste."
1,"Everything tastes better when your drunk.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, my burger was way better than I thought it was gonna be! Basic America Cheese Burger but it was cooked perfectly. One thing I hate is when I order a medium rare burger, it some how comes out overcooked. This thing was huge, I'm not sure there'll ever be a day when I'll be able to eat one of these things plus fries and expect myself to finish it.\n\nUsually when it comes to Vegas casino food, I try to stray away. I've been disappointed far too many times. I'm glad places like this can restore my faith in food for the masses."
0,"Frequent their quite often, will probably never go back after tonight. Rich is gone from what I hear and the bartender tonight in his place had quite the attitude. She might get her drinks right if she got off her phone while making them. Sounds like Rich went to Sago's I will be spending my money their instead."
0,"The name of this place had intrigued me every time I drove by until one drizzling, dismal evening months ago. While waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady I suspected was standing me up, I stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic, lusty and modern experience the name and sign promised.\n\nImmediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor, I draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar. Neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence. A young woman, American, came from the back and in an unplaceable NPR accent asked me which menus I'd like. Clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift, we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before me.\n\nThe water tasted .. odd.  Smelling of a mop-bucket after cleaning a gym floor. Tea next, in the saddest, stalest teabag I have ever seen, pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water. Okay, something bottled and stronger? Alas, the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable.\n\nSomewhere amidst the drinks buffet I'd ordered several courses of food, which came out apologetically, ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the space-time continuum.  Entree immediately, then sushi, soup, then, finally, a wilted, miserable salad. The rice was dry, the (chicken?) bland, the vegetables wilted. The soup was the mopwater, but warmer, and salted. Presumably someone had come in advance of me, ordered the entire restaurant's supply of 'interesting', 'delicious', and 'tolerable', then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophies.\n\nMy waitress apologized about the order, looking contrite but not surprised.\n\nThe shining light of that evening-apart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust, faded posters, and ancient paneling-was the 'fire island roll'.  This single element of color, flavor, and spice rescued the night from the Raymond Chandler direction it was taking.\n\nI got my phone call, paid my tab, and left, frighteningly sober and still hungry, my head (and stomach) full of naught but unfulfilled promises.\n\n[ed: it's entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time, and too many detective movies.]"
1,"In-n-out is for sure one of my favorite burger joints! Their use of fresh ingredients is what makes this place so awesome! Not to mention great customer service :) If you haven't been to In-n-out make sure to get yourself a double double and fries animal style, it will change your life. \n\nThis location in particular is generally busy as it's right on Nellis and in a busy shopping plaza. Service moves pretty quickly but you should expect some sort of a wait since everything is scratch made and fresh. As always good food takes time!"
1,Has anodyne coffee from Milwaukee (best I've ever had in my young life) makes a nice San Francisco BLT (BLT with guac) served with a side salad. Great place to read a book or study.
1,"another great time!!!\nLacey gave me purple hair and it's amazing, fabulous, stunning and oh so gorgous! I LOVE it when the sunlight is on my dark brown/ purple hair!\nTHANK YOU AGAIN!!!!!"
1,"Since the last time I came it has changed hands, etc. Today, the guy who helped me was super nice! Im preggers so while i like coffee I tend to avoid coffee while I am in the delicate condition.\n\nHe was nice enough to make me a Grasshopper blended without coffee, so its mint and chocolate, basically a shake. Its really rich and sweet but its yummy!\n\nI'll be back and once i can have my iced tea fix daily, Ill Really be frequent!"
0,"I came into this place one evening with the intention to check out the atmosphere and pricing. \nAs I walked in , the front desk guy is chatting with one of the girl members there. I waited patiently as I was looking around hoping another trainer or worker might acknowledge me. After 10 minutes of standing there like an idiot looking at brochures and signs, I came up and tried to get the guy's attention. The front desk guy just finish talking to the female member and finally asked me what I needed. I got my pricing , no promotion or other options was offered by the guy so I left disappointing.\nOverall- atmosphere looks like a hookah lounge , very dimly lit. \nService from the front desk was horrible, they act like they didn't want your business."
0,"Wow! I asked for a mango/banana smoothie cause this place looks so organic & earthie.  1st off, The gal making my drink has long scraggly hair that is not pulled back i& in everything. Then they ask, orange juice or milk. I ask is it fresh oj, no.  Then I see her putting in 2 huge scoops of powder so when she brings my drink I ask, what was the powder......SUGAR!! Seriously! Healthy Smoothy, I think not!"
0,"ehhhhhhh I mean nothing was wrong with Sumit's per say it.... just.... wasnt.... my thing? Kinda weird to be honest. \n\nI wouldnt call it \""yoga\"", I'd say its more like \""moving around in a hot room-doing the occasional downward dog-listening to the Black Eyed Peas-then saying namaste at the end\"" time. huh. so yeah not quite \""yoga\""\n\nugh like I want to say something nice about this place but I can't really think of anything. OOoooo they sell nice headbands in front- so theres something. \n\nI guess I just prefer more traditional yoga over this, whatever this is...."
1,"Great high end brands mall connected to Aria hotel. Modern design deco, not crowed, nice place that you can shop all the luxury brands here! They have cafe, lounge and restaurant too. Have a rest if you need a break for shopping!"
1,"Origins has some awesome products. I highly recommend the Modern Friction face exfoliator and the Vitazing moisturizer. The employees at this store have always been super helpful. They are always willing to give you a *free* mini facial. If you have 15-20 minutes to spare, I recommend getting one done. They will sit you down and cleanse, exfoliate, treat, and moisturize your face. They'll walk you through all the steps and make recommendations for you. Make sure to ask for some samples of your favorite items to try at home. My only complaint... The prices on the items are a little high and the employees can get a little pushy about making a purchase."
0,"If CVS wants us to follow their rules shouldn't they do the same. 2 months in a row I've dropped off my 2 narcotic RX. When I dropped it off I said I would pick it up at noon cause it was New Year Eve. I got off early a wanted to make one trip so I didn't have to leave again. I called CVS at about 2pm to make sure my RX was filled cause I was leaving work. Two hours after the time they told me it would be ready.\nI talked to Lisa she was very rude and just plan ignored what I was saying. And then just hung up on me. I was shocked..I decided to go inside  rather than complain through the drive through. I explained to the nice lady and she did listen with a smile. I understand if you stick to you rules but you don't have to be jerks and rude about it .She listed to an earful. My mistake that I can't remember her name. Sorry..She said I should speak to the pharmacy manager. I did not that day cause there were so many people waiting. And I did finally get all my meds. They had two other prescriptions that I didn't even ask for already ready. My Drs office called some of my prescriptions in and gave me written.  I'm over it. Any Future Prescriptions I will go to a different location \nYou should teach your employees customer service. If it wasn't for customers you people would be out of job.. The month before was the same problem went to pick up and all was filled but the narcotics. I asked why? The girl said we can fill it now,  but somebody put them ion hold. For no reason. But she said if I came in they would have it ready right away. Last week your recording called me every day the house and my cell phone after I told you twice..\n I would come this weekend. Look in my file see all the money I give you per month. Why? To be verbally abused and talked down to by all the pharmacy staff at cvs."
0,"So, apparently greed and lackluster customer service as well as, I'm suspecting, inadequate servers are all combining to make Netflix, imo, go down the tubes. Here's a transcript of an email I attempted to send back to them (it was from an automated account) after they, for the third time, sent me the guilded steps for \""viewing success\"":\n\nHi. Thanks for these steps. The thing is I turn all my devices off regularly - probably 2 or 3 times a day - so they're constantly resetting like what you're saying to do in these instructions. And since I have ethernet, only the first 2 steps apply to me, and like I said, they're done on a regular basis, so...although you guys are quick with an answer, I still don't believe it's an adequate one to explain why I, with a premium package from my ISP, 13 mbps download speed, and comparatively little trouble streaming video on most other sites, e.g. YouTube, Digg, Hulu, etc., still continue to have problems loading content on your site.\n\nSince May, I can only successfully watch an entire movie without major interruption approx. 25% of the time. Maybe I should be paying 25% of my monthly bill? Perhaps you guys think we pay relatively little for the great service - and, in essence it is great, or was, for my first few months as a customer. And now, to hear you guys are jacking up your rates, when I'm DEFINITELY not getting what I pay for, I think sucks the big one. I've also had several DVDs that have skipped and been unwatchable also, so here's an idea coming from someone in business development and marketing:\n\n - Skip raising your rates and focus on customer satisfaction first\n-  Hire more (or better) people for DVD inspection/quality control/tech support\n-  Use the billions you must be raking in and get more servers/DVDs to ensure the quality you purport to have\n\nThen you won't take a huge tumble when rate jacking and thumbing your nose at customers causes them to jump ship by the millions in the months and years to come. Just my 2 cents."
1,"GOOD SALAD BAR\nConsistently, good food. The soup, salad and  desserts are good.\nGREAT value for families with small children under 2 eat free. Ice Cream Machine with the toppings and really good home made biscuits and honey butter."
1,"This show is like no other in Las Vegas, I loved it. Very well put together and told as it should be.My girlfriend got pulled up on stage, how cool is that.We even got to talk to everyone after the show. The evening just kept getting better and better, The music is played live loud and rockin so take a bow.  It's good that I' m local because I will see it again. Thanks for plugging it in, cranking it up, and laying it down."

We will definitely be telling all our friends about this little jem!!!!!!"
0,"1)  The customer service at this store is terrible.  The employees are rude, particularly Scott who works in the plant section.   \n2)  The plants this past summer were infested.  I had to return two mandevillas because of aphids, and Bruce gave me a hard time about refunding me.  Last straw:  the $50 rubber plant I purchased in August came home with some time of mite infestation, I was able to treat the plant successfully, but recently noticed that the plant was ailing.  Upon close inspection, I noticed it was full of aphids.  Disgusting.  I am fortunate that my other plants, which came from different nurseries, were not infected.  Rubber plant went in garbage, and I will never waste another dollar at Bruce Company again."
0,"What can I say. Disappointed!! Very disappointed. Especially after reading the Yelp reviews. I did a lot of research on where to eat in Las Vegas. I did not want to pay the $200.00 plus price tag of some of the top top rated places, but, I am a foodie and wanted a memorable meal. \nFirst, my partner and I had a reservation, and were seated at an extremely large 4-6 top table (I usually appreciate a big table) however, this was completely impersonal. By the way we were eating at 6:30 p.m. so it was not crowded. We asked for another table and were seated at a banquette. The server arrived, but acted as if he was not expecting company. \nThe best experience was with the sommelier, whose name unfortunately I cannot remember. He gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner. He was very friendly and nice to talk to(more later).\nMy partner ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino (imagining that this would be stellar given Michael Mina's roots).  The burger was terrific, the fries however, were over salted(I am a salt lover, so really too much) and frankly pretty ordinary. \nNow to my Cioppino, first, it was obvious from the first bite that the fish and shellfish were pre-cooked, no, really. I could not believe it, also, the temperature of the whole dish was off. The \""broth\"" which is actually more like a tomato saucea was not hot enough, too thick and just bland and ordinary tasting. The combination of the pre-cooked fish and shellfish was really not good. I only ate the lobster tail and the scallop(also not cooked correctly). The sommelier came by towards the end of the meal and asked how everything was (the server never returned to ask). I asked him if he really wanted to know and I told him about the above. I saw him tell the server, who never asked us and just brought us a trio of sorbets (the chocolate was yummy but the peach and mango tasted like Sharon's.) \nOverall, I would never recommend this restaurant or eat here again. I was glad to take the complimentary copy of WIne Spectator with Michael Mina on the cover, but would be reticent to try his restaurants again."
0,"It's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. Chinese/Mexican concept is great because I'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. The Dan Dan Mian didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. The Gan Pung Ji chicken was dry, and the Lucky Sui Mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. The only positive memory I have was that their guacamole was good. The ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the Cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. If only the food didn't suck."
0,"Get in.  Get out.  And enjoy your ice and custard.\n\nThe wife and I stopped at this particular Rita's on the way home the other night.  Now, we love Rita's.  She always gets a wild black cherry gelati and I always try something different, this time I went with a favorite, mango.  So, why the 2 stars?\n\nThis location was a disaster area.  Kids were running around, the workers (all teenagers with no supervision) were swearing at them to stop.  Local riff raff were sitting at all the little tables with no treats, just soaking in the air conditioning.  The particular lad that helped us was wearing only a dirty wife beater and seemed very, very annoyed that we dare order gelatis from this establishment.  When I ordered he actually rolled his eyes and made an annoyed sound.  Not a great way to start the interaction with a place you are giving your money to.  When an even younger worker came out of the back and the one helping us yelled at him to \""get his @ss to work\"" I asked if the manager was around.  He looked at me and said \""N*****a I am the manager.\""\n\nHad the wife not been pregnant and wanting her gelati I would have just left.  I still should have just left.\n\nGo to another Rita's and enjoy their delicious treats."
1,"Salt did me right.\nMy wife brought our crew there for my surprise birthday party, and Salt was perfect.  We were about 12 deep, so Salt had reserved a section for us, and then totally treated us right.  The server kept drinks going (obviously her job, but she was on it and with a great attitude), Salt put my name up on the TV with a little HB message, and even bought us a round of shots.\nHere's the thing, we could have gone anywhere.  But for a birthday party of close friends, we didn't want to wait in long lines or yell at each other over too-loud music or get separated while being bumped by the \""clones\"".  That's why Salt was perfect.  Not over crowded, but busy enough to have a vibe, cheerful staff that isn't resentful, and a solid DJ.\nMany thanks Salt.  It was a night to remember."
0,"Don't go to this buffet, you'll be totally frustrated with their food. Poor variety, cheap food, long time waiting and high price !\n     There's no king crab, no lobster,  no lamb and no sirloin. Wynn buffet is no more as it was ! \n     See the sushi session picture I took inside the buffet, that's all they have, the gas station sushi \uff01No salmon, no caviar\uff0cno octopus, shrimp sushi only a few, tuna is always out of service. Rice are dry and hard, crab legs(snow crab) are raw, salty and not tasting fresh. Chinese food only Kungbao Chick, drunken noodle, fried dumplings and very few Cantonese steam food. \n     Their American & Mexican & Italian only offer cheap food. you can definitely get the same or better food with less 20 bucks in other restaurant.\n     I do see many many people eating plain bread, pizza, sausages inside.\n     This buffet only worth 15 for their food. If you only want a nice environment, regardless of your money, that OK for you (because you're buying their environment rather than their food); Otherwise stay away from it.\n   This buffet charge you 45 + and give you a 2 hour limit. It's the price to enjoy a awesome lobster buffet in Orlando."
1,"Super! Not only is this some of the best pizza you can get, but its \""pizza with a purpose\"". The restaurant hires underprivileged kids who would otherwise find it hard to find a job. Read the postings on the dream wall while waiting for your order."
1,"Great restaurant, great food.  Great for groups - upbeat environment.  \n\nA bit on the pricey side."
1,"So, it was my boyfriends birthday this past weekend, and we decided to do it up Vegas style.  We arrived in Vegas on Friday, and checked into the Palm.  I'll review that in a minute.  Hold your horses.\n\nOn Saturday evening, we went up to Ghost Bar...up, up, up 55 floors!  If you want to go and dance your ass off, this isn't the place for you.  (they actually have a sign 'no dancing', or something like that)  If you want some pretty decent music, chill surroundings, and pretty people to look at.  You've come to the right place.  \n\nIt's much smaller than you'd expect,  but the decor and the vibe is incredible.  \n\nAnd the view!!  It's absolutely incredible.  55 floors over Vegas' bright lights offers more than a view.  This was an experience.  \n\nThe drinks are steep, but nice and strong.  The staff friendly.  The bouncers scary.  The clientele, mostly normal.  I had these 2 'I'm too sexy to button my shirt up because I like to show my hairy chest' guys hitting on me.  With my boyfriend standing right there.  Well, that didn't last long, but besides that, it was a great night!\n\nIf you're visiting Vegas, I highly recommend checking this place out.  Just make sure you've got a few extra $'s to spend!!"
0,"I was very excited when my friend told me about this place on Ste-Catherine because they serve Korean BBQ. We ordered two orders of kalbi/short ribs, korean pancake, and a dolsot bi bim bap because one of us is a vegetarian (not a good idea to come here because it's very meat oriented). \n\nWe were given 4 side dishes to start the meal. Too little, I thought because I am usually given at least 10 different ones at other Korean restaurants. Maybe it's because of the lack of varieties, I felt that they tasted kinda bland.\n\nFor the BBQ, they used a curved hot steel pan with a gas stove. We started cooking some of the short ribs but we felt rushed because the server kept asking us to add more meat and turn them over when they started to change color. We found that extremely annoying because I thought the point of eating Korean BBQ is so that we can cook it ourselves at OUR pace. It didn't taste as I expected because the marinade was rather mediocre.\n\nThe pancake was super thick due to excessive batter and too little seafood. That was perhaps the last thing I need after the rice, soup, and oily kalbi that pretty much filled me up. I like mine thin, light and with lots of seafood. The bi bim bap wasn't that impressive either. My friend hardly had any of it. \n\nOverall, I am pretty disappointed with La Maison Bulgogi. They have other selections too but if they can't impress me with the classics, I won't even bother trying the rest. I highly recommend somewhere else for Korean food."
0,Average at best. I am so disappointed. I ordered several items from menu. The onion soup is mediocre and very oily. The beets were quite good. The macaroni gratin side was average. A flatiron steak for over $40 is ridiculous and honestly it was not well seasoned. Bottom line: go to Daniel Boulud's or joel robuchon's restaurant. This restaurant was empty and a disappointment. I don't think it will be there in 2 years.
1,"Subway's also good with me. Make this short & sweet.\n\nStar 1: The location is cool, next to a Golden Spoon & Rosati's.\nStar 2: Everything's organized.\nStar 3: The food looks pretty appetizing.. Unlike other Subways I know of.\nStar 4: The server was pretty nice.\n\nWhat's up with the 5th star? Dirty tables. Get your Adele on & turn some of them 'til they're clean."
0,"I have been to other Ono locations, and had good food.  I tried this one twice (thought the first time was just a bad fluke).  What I go was fatty, bad tasting food with slow service.\nDid I mention the parking lot is 1/2 the size it needs to be?\nFool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, I'm telling."
0,"I was interested in staying there because on travelocity it was a 4 star hotel. However when we got there, i was shocked because it looked like... well what it was.  It was a remodeled apartment building complete with carport parking.  I was pretty disappointed. It looked like they tried hard to remodel it, but all up and down the hall the paint was chipping, and it just felt old, with a new rug. It would be cool, or ok if i wasnt expecting something expecting a 4 star i guess. But it was affordable. I didnt stay in the room, we switched hotels. I brought my daughter, and part of the \""decor\"" is old pictures of naked women, which probably if i went with buddies i wouldnt mind as much, but it just didnt strike me as that tasteful. And thats all i have to say about that."

0,"Cool atmosphere, but just about the worst service you can imagine.   Ordered a beer 10 minutes ago and still waiting."
1,Yum off the charts. I was moaning from their shredded beef  tacos. Some of the best I have ever had and I am surrounded by mexican joints.\n\nPrices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinks.\n\nThe location near the art galleries makes for a perfect date night. It is also super charming inside and on the patio.\n\nThis will be my Scottsdale go to place.\n\nAm so jealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood!
0,"Given that this is only one of only a few restaurants in my neighborhood, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, my dining experience was terrible from the get go. \n\nThere are some good points. First of all, the outdoor seating is lovely, and is a great place to sit and watch people go by. Service is polite and attentive, but not overly chatty. At the moment, complimentary sangria is being offered, because the restaurant does not have a liquor license yet.\n\nNow the bad. After I ordered, I was told that the restaurant's credit card machine didn't work. I didn't have any cash on me, so I walked to the Circle K to use the ATM, since that's the closest place. Not the fault of the management, and they were apologetic, so I went. \n\nThe food was awful. I ordered the Moroccan sliders and the fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were almost completely uncooked and inedible, I had to saw through them with my knife. In addition to that, they were swimming in oil and some sort of white cheese, and had absolutely no flavor. The sliders, which were listed on the menu as being flavored with apricots and spices had no flavor either, and were topped with an unappetizing gob of mayo. The tables had no salt or pepper shakers, so I couldn't even add my own seasoning to try and make the food palatable.\n\nWhen my server came back and asked how the food was, I replied \""I don't think you want me to answer that.\"" I said that I didn't want to be rude, but my potatoes were undercooked. When he asked about the burgers, I replied that they were \""fine.\"" He graciously offered to not charge me for my meal, and gave me a take out box, so I could try and cook the food through at home. The burgers were fine with some salt, but I couldn't make the potatoes edible and they ended up in the trash.\n\nAll in all, a lousy experience. I hope this place gets it together, because it would be nice to have another good place to eat in the neighborhood."
0,"I lived here for 4 years. While I was here they were pretty good. When I was leaving, they provided the worst customer service.\n\nFirst, we had to extend our lease by 1 month and had communicated that on many occasions. However, they waited until the last day to remind us of needing a 30 day written notice. When we stated that they knew that months in advance, they just said give it now and pay us.\n\nAfter we left we got an important package delivered and before USPS had started forwarding. Instead of showing courtesy and sending the letter, they needed a self addressed stamped envelope. Not only are they wasting time but can't they handle the 2 dollars with the exorbitant rent they charge?\n\nTruly they're heading downhill and I have never had a worse experience in all my years of renting."
1,"Not a single con to report this time!  Our rooms were ready at 2:00, we were given the right room keys, the hallways were nice and cool, our luggage was up in 10 minutes and our room was spotless!  \n\nWe loved every minute of our stay and hated to go home."
0,Gross Sunday Brunch\n\nWasted money and just degrading for a buffet in Vegas.\n\nNever again.  Even the desserts sucked.\n\nWish I had checked reviews before eating here =(
0,"Most racist ignorant salon I have ever been too.\n\nI am Dominican and black and I  am very fluent in Spanish.\nI am from NYC and have been to many Dominican salons and prices over there range from 30-60 (I have shoulder length and thick hair) \n\n\nSo I told her about my mixed race and she told me that I must of gotten my bad hair from my black side. While washing my hair she was complaining that it was too thick and told me she didn't want to untangle my hair because it looked like hard work so I offered to do it for her so she can stop whining. She told me my dad (my black side) must have bad hair like that. Funny because he actually has very fine hair... STRIKE 1 !!\n\nDuring the time under the hair dryer her and her mother were talking about the other clients and how sad it was that black people hair is nasty and how can they be born that way. Mind you, most of the people in there are black and probably can't understand Spanish... STRIKE 2\n\nAfter blow drying my hair I was impressed, she did a good job, I was just thinking about giving her a tip until she told me my hair came out ugly because I needed my ends trimmed. I told her I was fine and that I am satisfied with my hair and she kept telling me I needed one so my hair can look right. She then told me that she wouldn't charge me and that I should get it before she changes her mind. So I finally agreed.\n\nBIG mistake I made because I hated it after she cut my ends\n\nThen when it came time to pay she charged me an extra $15 for cutting my ends on top of the $70 for a wash and set because she said it was so much work untangling my thick hair and next time I come she would charge me less...\n\n\nI WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS HORRID DISGUSTING PLACE!!"
1,"This park is so cool and gorgeous. I love the set up, all the neat \""wagon\"" picnic tables (with their own barbecue grills), the lush grass, plants, and trees, and most importantly, the theme! When you walk in, there's bathrooms and water fountains on the left and a large covered playground in the center. Lots of trees lining the park and mostly blocking the view of the streets from inside the park. The picnic tables covered by the \""wagons\"" sit in a semi-circle with a mini \""amphitheater\"" in the center. Then, the rest of the park is grass and trees, beautiful! There are also trails for horses and nice paths. Overall, wonderful place to hang out with the family and photograph sessions!"
0,"I will never return to the place. Service was very slow. My sons food was under cooked, coffee sucked and on top the that the place smelled like BO/toilet."
1,"I don't know what they've done, but this place has SERIOUSLY improved their food over the past year. I was wary to try it again since the first time I went (yes, over a year ago) it was less-than mediocre. I live less than a mile away, was jonesing for indian food one day, and didn't want to drive far. I forced myself to go here and am now completely ecstatic that there's an indian food joint I can walk to, gorge myself, and roll my arse home. \n\nThe menu is standard, but somehow a little better because they offer dishes that have subtle differences. HMMM, let's see. I don't know if i'm going to describe this correctly:\n\nOkay, I'm a vegetarian - DON'T STOP READING THIS, DAMNIT! I know what good food is!\n\nStarting over - I'm a vegetarian, and I eat A LOT of indian food, and I have eaten at a lot of indian food places. I don't claim to be an indian foodie, but I do know that the vegetarian dishes have subtle differences so I think some places omit the dishes that are similar and just hope that people who come in order the thing that's closest to the thing they really wanted. There's one dish I always order - paneer (tikka) masala, that some places don't have so I order the closest thing to it, and of course I can't remember it right now but it's another paneer dish with a tomato base that's similar. The thing that's awesome about this place is that it has BOTH, as well as other dishes that other restaurants sometimes don't put on the menu. You know what I mean?\n\nWho cares if you know what I mean - FOUR STARS!"
0,"I'm sad that this is the only Lush store in Las Vegas because not only is it a pain to get to (being on the strip and all), the employees are insufferable and make it impossible to actually shop.\n\nI'm not new to Lush. When I walk in and the employees ask if I've been there before, I tell them yes, I have, I've been using their stuff for years and I'm familiar with the products... so they don't really need to give me their whole handmade-vegan-natural-organic-crap spiel. BUT THEY DO ANYWAY. And then they follow me around the store asking if I need help, or if I want to see how a shampoo bar works, or have I tried this before, etc., etc. Normally I would appreciate a friendly sales staff, but here they are absurdly pushy! Do they work on commission?!\n\nI give them two stars because I love the products and the first girl who helped us was very nice and friendly without being annoying, and helpful, while still knowing when to walk away and leave me alone. But I have to take off stars for the creepy male employee who followed me around the store and would not leave me alone, making it impossible for me to actually shop. Even when I said, \""All right, thank you, I'm going to go do the rest of my shopping now,\"" HE FOLLOWED ME ACROSS THE STORE. And the other male employee who started an impromptu hipster dance party in the middle of the store, directly in front of the products I was trying to see, forcing me to walk through said hipster dance party with an annoyed expression on my face, causing another employee to say to me, while laughing at his oh-so-random antics, \""I'm sorry if he's making you uncomfortable! He's such a goof! HEHEHE\"" in this \""I'm-sorry-you're-such-a-square-and-don't-appreciate-our-hilarious-RANDOMNESS\"" tone. And the lady at the cash register who told me I could get a WAY better deal if I bought the larger version of one of the products I was purchasing, even though when you do the math on price. vs. size you only really end up saving about $2 while actually spending twice as much, which does not qualify as a way better deal in my book, and kept asking me if I wanted to buy more things while she was ringing me up!\n\nI'm doing my Lush shopping online from now on, because I cannot handle the intensely social, intensely pushy sales experience at this store. Even my extremely friendly, sociable husband was put off by the atmosphere. I would actually have bought more stuff and spent more money if they had left me alone so I could, you know, shop."
1,Great place to buy health food at a reasonable price. They have a great selection of premade soups. Great deil section and a very helpful butcher shop
1,"The name of this establishment has changed--it is no longer the Mt. Horeb Mustard Museum, but is now the National Mustard Museum, since they have moved out of Mt. Horeb and into Middleton, WI.   A lot more space in the new location (yes, I've been there more than once), the usual goofy stuff (mustard documentary, faux press releases, old advertising and mustard jars from around the world), and really nice people make this a great place to stop.\n\nTry their maple peppercorn mustard--it's delicious on brats."
0,"DON'T EVER BUY SCRUBS HERE.\n I was given the wrong pants size (their fault) so had to drive back to exchange it. They didn't have the size because they sent everything on a \""mobile show\"" (their fault!!!) and I asked if they could just ship me the correct size so I didn't have to keep wasting my time. I was told it was $8+ to ship it to me because it was MY fault!! This place has zero customer service. I will never come here again and definitely will never recommend it to anyone ever again. \nAt least Kmart will ship my pants."

I'm new to makeup too - the YouTube \""how to eyeliner\"" kind of girl.  Ulta can be an intimidating place...\n\nAnyway, walk into Ulta.  Girl at the registers says hello.  I wander all over the store looking for that Naked eye shadow, you know which one... Super pretty, I think it's just under $20.  Searching for that, know what I want, just not where to find it.  There are associates EVERYWHERE, but none of them paying attention to me.  Two associates helping someone else.  One walks by me (while I'm browsing clearance) but doesn't say anything.  I wander around some more, obviously looking for something - and no one offers to help or even check on me.  ...ULTA, I JUST WANT YOU TO HELP ME SPEND MY MONEY.\n\nI finally found the Naked eyeshadow.  The color I want is out if stock.  No sales associates to be found.  I left.  No one said \""goodbye\"", \""thanks for coming\"", etc.  Maybe they'll be getting it in soon.  I wouldn't know.  C'mon Ulta - I wanted to spend money!"

0,"Hikari has one of the worst quality fish in Las Vegas.  They let you eat it sashimi style because they order the cheapest quality of fish. The service is also horrible.  The waitresses are very slow and cant comprehend orders very well.  Some orders will come out extremely fast, while others will come out at the end of your meal.  We had to remind the waitresses at least twice for every order. \n\n***The worst part of our visit was that we found a squirming tiny worm in our ginger/wasabi plate.  THIS PLACE IS UNSANITARY.

0,"One of my dogs had a seizure during the middle of the night, and I had to take him to the Banfiled inside the PetSmart on Signal Butte because the Banfield where I usually take my dogs had no available appointments. I decided to take my other dog with me to get routine care done, and, as we were standing in line at the Banfield check-in counter, there was an older gentleman with a very big dog standing behind me. My big dog that I had with me, (who was attacked as a puppy by another big dog and therefore, does not like other big dogs), started going after the dog behind me. In trying to restrain my dog, my other one got loose, and the big dog behind me in line grabbed him by the neck, and lifted him off his feet and shook him like a rag doll. My dog required surgery to repair a torn shoulder and it cost me well over $600. Not ten seconds after this happened, the manager came and pointed directly at me while I was still on the ground and said something like, \""So, you let go of the your dog's leash.\"" I already knew that, and why he had to say it, I just don't know. The manager quickly made a judgement call and told the guy with the vicious dog he could leave the store without so much as getting his name. I contacted animal control the same day, and a woman said leash laws do not apply at all if a dog gets loose inside a building. I asked her if I could have sued the gentlemen for medical expenses for having a vicious dog that mauled mine, and she stated yes, in small claims court. I contacted the district manager to make an official complaint, and what he basically said is this, \""What's your part in this?\"" I said I admitted I accidentally let go of my dog, but because of his employees' actions, I will be unable to collect ANY amount for medical bills. He refused to see this or even consider his employee's actions and at that point, I hung up. The PestSmart manager made a judgement call that wasn't his to make, and he became the jury as well. Because of this, a man is walking around with a very mean, very vicious dog who could bite someone or another animal in the future. The total unwillingness to even consider my point of view and of not getting the owner's name makes me feel I can't trust my dogs not to get hurt there and I will never step foot in the Signal Butte PetSmart again."
0,"The positive reviews are shocking to me! This was not at all our experience.\nHere are the facts:\n-The metal handrails, all over the park, heat up so fast in the Vegas sun it will burn your hand; watch out for this if you have smaller children\n-The staff is a group of unorganized teenagers with no clue or concern about customer service. They aren't trained well and it was difficult to even find someone who was actually 'in charge' to help with problems\n-The lines are RIDICULOUS!!!! If you don't pay for the speed pass to hold your place in line for a ride, you have to stand-uncovered in the Vegas sun-to wait for a raft, then climb up the tower to again wait in line to actually go down the slide. Be prepared bc this adds another $35+ to your general admission ticket\n-The rental rafts are a waste of money. They can only be used on 2 'rides' & none of the slides. Plus people just abandon them throughout the day so just pick up one of those when you want to float on one. \n-The food is overpriced and gross, the sunscreen is outrageous, but I realize those prices are par for the course at any amusement park. \n-Parking is a nightmare. Be prepared to walk...far\n\nMaybe in a couple more years they will have some of the kinks worked out but it's nothing but an expensive hassle.  Save your time & sanity as a local & just take your kids to the Rio pool for free."

1,"As a city center resident I eat here quite often. It's almost always full of people and the servers and staff are very friendly. The vibe is an upscale pub with lots of amp,e comfy seating. \nThe oysters are great! 2$ a piece durning happy hour might even make them a little tastier :)  \nThe appetizers are to die for! You really can't go wrong treating this as a tapas bar with friends so you get to try a little of everything! The tuna tar tar is tasty and whatever sauce they use just adds to the over all melt in your mouth texture. The duck buns are a gooey mess of flavor :) unfortunately they do come out a bit dry sometimes... You MUST try the steak tacos again, the sauce is what makes them memorable. \nStay away from the parmesan sliders. They just come out overly dry and lacking luster. \nAs for beer options there really is no comparison! The servers are very good at making recommendations and with so many options it can seem daunting to try to pick! They will even make sure you love your beer or replace it till you find one you like. \nFor a casual dining option to watch the game or meet up for happy hour you really can't go wrong with TE Pub"
1,"I took my first class at Sweet Basil last night to learn how to make Thai food. I had such a great time; I didn't expect to have that much fun. The instructor was extremely knowledgeable and discussed each of the recipes before we were broken into groups of two people per recipe. \n\nCooking is one of my passions, and I am just so glad that I can feed that passion with more classes at this establishment. Some people have told me that I can get recipes online, and \""why pay for the classes\""? Well, it was worth every penny to be instructed by the chef, learn about the ingredients, see hands-on demonstrations of techniques, use their huge kitchen and utensils (without having to wash the dishes), meet new people who share a love of cooking, and then to finally sit down and taste everything for dinner with a glass of wine. \n\nIt was superb; an experience that has made me decide that I will be taking classes regularly at Sweet Basil."

The prices are CRAZY, though - this is a DINER in MADISON not Aix en Provence. \n\nUnfortunately, the service is TERRIBLE!!!  \n\nDuring one visit, the patrons at the table next to us started changing their baby's diaper on the TABLE - the wait staff was unable to intervene - so my husband and I had to say something.  Who wants to see a baby's ass during dinner? not to speak of air-borne illnesses landing in our food ~ 3 feet away."
1,"Finding good Indian food in Phoenix has made the move here easier...especially a place that's a mile from my house.\n\nParking is easy\nService is always fantastic\nTake-out is always ready very quickly and very hot\nGood variety of spices at the attached little store\n\nTried and recommend: Shahi paneer, chicken tikka masala, veg korma. chana masala\nMight revisit but not thrilled with initially: saag paneer, aloo gobi\n\nIf you like spicy (or not), tell them--they go kinda easy on the hotness unless you specifically ask (use the 1-10 scale)\n\nI wish it was a little less formal feeling inside, but I typically do take-out so not a big deal--it just makes for a date-ish environment rather than a group o' friends environment.  Again, not a bad thing, i'm just sayin'. I've also never checked out the lunch buffet so maybe the white tablecloths and preset water glasses are a PM thing. \n\n[p.s. i'm now officially amused that i just said i wished a place was less nice. don't really hear that too often...]"
0,"I went here to exchange a part (oil drain plug) that I purchased from another location that did not fit my car at it should. It turned out the package contained the incorrect plug (from the manufacturer). When returning the part, the guy at the counter asked the supervisor what to do with the part I was returning.... He said 'Re-sell it. We have to for inventory'. So you're going to try to sell it to someone else knowing it is wrong??? That's horrible."
0,"The first time I went here it was AWESOME and then sadly the next two visits have deteriorated into a two-star rating.  What happened, Pancake Cafe??  You keep getting voted best breakfast in Madison, but the change in quality from early spring 2011 to winter 2011 is utterly ridiculous.  The first time we went, my boyfriend had the corned beef hash and raved about it.  This past visit, he could barely choke it down it was so bland and salty.  Same story for the eggs benedict, with a very bland hollandaise sauce.  I wish it had kept the up the same quality we experienced in the spring, but after this third visit, I'm over it.  Average breakfast at best!"
0,"First let me start off with the good. This restaurant is very pretty. The lighting is perfect and it is right across the street from the Bellagio fountains which you can see from the patio and from inside. Our server was also great. He was very attentive and even make us laugh a few times without being overly goofy.\n\nThe bad. And it was bad. We ordered an appetizer of assorted seafood which included whole lobster, tuna tar tar, jumbo gulf shrimp and oysters. The oysters were mishandled and had pieces of shell in them. The lobster was lacking flavor. It tasted bland. However the gulf shrimp were good as well as the tuna but for the price of the plate my husband and I were severely underwhelmed. Second course, pork chops and frites. The pork chop was incredibly dry, the seasoning was good but the pork should had been pulled from the fire a good 10 minutes earlier. We ate it but later hit the food court in our hotel for sub sandwiches that we liked so much better. I would not go back to Mon Ami Gabi for food but I would go back for drinks on their patio. The view is fantastic."
1,"You don't find many businesses that work the way this one - extreme work ethic, professional, and does an excellent job. I am so impressed that I can't say enough. They cleaned my monster sectional and it is beautiful! Robert also did my carpets - even after he had thrown out his back - and they looked like new carpets - literally. He puts 100% into what he does. I had Stanley Steemer in the past - overpriced and does a very mediocre job. I would like to see Robert become a national chain. He would be a millionaire with the quality he does. It's astounding. Thank you Robert!!!! \n\nP.S. Robert - Adding an update - I got 100% of my rental deposit back! Thanks to you!"
0,"The other reviews are pretty spot on... this place was downright baaaddd. A buddy and I went there for lunch and I was pretty stoked to eat some fish and chips. The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options. Prices were pretty good. That is where the good ends though. \n\nThe fish and chips comes with the 'special sauce' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce. 50 cents isn't a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn't come with tartar sauce included!? That said, the tartar sauce was decent. There is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty dirty. When our food came I was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces...it just screamed of store-bought frozen fish pieces. My buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked (and tasted) like an inferior version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores. The special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup, it was OK but I think I would have just preferred ketchup for my fries. The fish was very bleh. Tasted like old frozen fish. The battering was OK but there was way too much salt that had been sprinkled on top...maybe to mask the old fish taste? \n\nApparently this place has a decent community following, but if you're looking for some good fish and chips I'd avoid this place like the plague. Some of the worst fish I've ever had."
1,"They did a FANTASTIC job!\n\nLet's start from the beginning...Ed showed up on time for the quote. He measured everything and then showed the hubby and I all the types of grass he offers. He was not pushy at all or up selling the more expensive grass. He let us take our time to make our choice. \n\nSo after 3 quotes Ed offered the best price and we were ready to set a date.\n\nThe day of, Ed and team showed up on time and got to work right away. Hubby asked questions as always (lol) and left for work knowing everything would be completed to his liking. He was right!!!! The front and back yard came out breath taking and looks amazing. It looks so real!!! All his employees were very professional and cleaned up everything as if nothing had been completed. All that was left was a beautiful landscaped yard. \n\nI highly recommended this company to anyone. The work is amazing and they were friendly and great to work with. Anymore yard work I need (ideas already swirling in my head) I will not hesitate to call them.\n\nBTW...they don't just do fake grass, they do all kinds of landscaping (walkways, fire pits, waterfalls, etc)."
0,"We came for brunch, even with a groupon it would have been $20 for us to share eggs Benedict with 2 pancakes ( plus the $12 we paid for the groupon) \n\nEggs Benedict came with the egg hard, common mistake so I sent it back. Pancakes came paperthin so we tried to eat like crapes. One bite in and realized it was doughy  inside.\n\nNew eggs Benedict came and whites were not done and it was tasteless. \n\nHi ho hi ho off to Mimi's  we go"
1,"Sometimes having pizza and wings delivered to your doorstep is the ideal dinner. Last night was one of those nights. The last time we had pizza was at Villa Pizza's new location on Boulder Highway, so this time we decided to order from Rosati's. \n\nWe decided to go with a large two topping pizza, and a dozen wings. I always order the wings extra crispy from Rosati's and they turn out delicious. Even with the #3 delivery fee, our total with tax (but before tip) was under $30. Yes, you can get cheaper pizzas. Doesn't make them better...\n\nWhen I placed my order, the girl on the phone already knew my address based on the number that popped up on their caller id. I love when businesses have this system in place. I was told my food would be to me within the hour. It took 35 minutes. I love when business beat their deadlines too!\n\nRosati's also has a program where you can save a piece of the pizza box and after you get 12 you get 50% off your 13th pizza. Only downside to the program is that it does not apply to delivery."
0,"There's a Mongolian barbecue in Indianapolis that I absolutely love and used to go to quite often. When I moved to Madison my boyfriend assured me that this place was the bees knees. Alas, it is not. The sauce is average and their barbecue is quite bland. The meat is dry and tough. The fish and seafood are terrible. The veggies are what you would expect. The staff is amazing! The grillers are usually entertaining and Joy, my favorite waitress, is such a peach. I keep getting dragged back here, but I never enjoy the food much. They have a freestyle Coke machine, so that's pretty neat. The BEST part about this place is the cheesecake rangoon. It's usually the bribe that gets me to go. Every restaurant should put it on their menu."
1,very little to complain about with TGI Fridays.  i am always able to get an item that is no longer on the menu (blackened Cajun chicken sandwich) and the menu is constantly changing.  Always worth a visit a few times a month.
1,"D'lish.. it is absolutely Delish!  The food is fresh and tasty!  The location is in a good spot, right before you hit the main part of Scottsdale.  It has a DRIVE THRU!!  Brilliant idea!  The seating inside is tiny, which makes it difficult to sit down and have lunch with a friend.  There are no heaters outside, so if it's a cold Arizona day and there are no spots inside, you're out of luck.  \n\nThe morning buzz with almond milk was absolutely delicious!  My friend had the California club and it was warm, fresh and absolutely delicious!  I will definitely come here again for breakfast or lunch and use the drive thru!"
0,"O      M         G         !\n\nTonight there was an actual clip about how the moon was big looking.  And, to show how the moon was big looking the newscaster stood outside the local studio.  Great right?  No. He basically showed the Sandra Day O'Connor building with the moon BEHIND IT.  Yes, that's right, not in front of it, not next to it, but behind it.\n\nThen he talked about how if you hold a dime up to the moon it still is the same size regardless of how close it is to the horizon.  Great information, right?  No.  Have I mentioned that you couldn't see the moon in his newscast?\n\nI seriously thought that Phoenix news couldn't get any worse with the clips about rain puddles when rain occurred earlier or the 8 minutes of reviews about how the 27 degree day affected Phoenicians.  But, this was the worst news ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nAnd, yes, I really did mean to add that many exclamation points."
0,"Excited to visit, left ashamed.\n\nFood:\nnot impressed, jambalaya was very commercial tasting, in fact almost like canned jambalaya. I really don't have much words. just bland, boring, and i have had real jambalaya and it is way better than the crap this place served me. the  sausage was good and the only thing i ate.it was also very mushy in texture like it was overcooked.\n\nService\nNon existent. place was empty when we arrived and now i know why.\nwaited 15 minutes for the waiter to come back so we can get the check and go far away and never return.\n\noverall: anyone can make better at home from a box. so disappointed!!!"
0,"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (32 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!\n\nI'm sorry fellow Yelpers, but I was hugely disappointed.  After reading everyones reviews I was excited when I finally had the chance to try this place.  I was so hungry but not even that gave me a reason to rave about the taste and quality of the food.\n\nI ordered the combination plate with a grilled fish taco, and a carne asada enchilada.  My plate came with black beans and white rice (even though I specifically asked for brown).  Everything on my plate was bland except for the mild green salsa which I'll have to say was the only good part of my meal.  I had to dip everything into this salsa to get a good taste out of anything on my plate.  The grilled fish taco had no taste at a;;!  The fish was a thick piece, and because it was o thick, it's bland taste took over the entire taco.  It was dry, and disappointing.  The carne asada enchilada I had was mediocre because the meat inside was chewy and in addition, difficult to chew down and swallow!  I was questioning how old the beef is or if they cooked it too long.  I like my beef to be tender!\n\nI was really upset that my experience turned out the way that it did.  I guess I'm used to the authenticity of some other mexican food joints.  But even the american infused ones such as Rubios taste way better than the food here.\n\nI do give it a couple stars for the bar they hav in there w/ video poker and TVs to watch your favorite sports.  They also have daily drink specials which is pretty cool too."
1,"Love EVERYTHING about baby stacks, they are awesome!!! Great service & food! Must visit anytime in Vegas!!!"
0,"I rarely give one star reviews, but Filiberto's was horrible! I mean, really, how can you mess up Mexican food? \n\nThe hubby and I decided to stop in here after seeing that the sandwich shop next door is no more (very disappointing, by the way).  First off, there was nobody at the counter and the place seemed to be deserted.  When we finally got somebody to come out and help us, both employees were extremely rude.  No smiles, not even a \""may I help you\"".  She just looked at us as if we were an annoyance.  My first thought was that considering that two other restaurants in the strip mall had gone out of business recently, you'd think they would be trying to keep some business...anyway...on to the food.\n\nI decided to go with the carnitas torts since I had been hoping for a sandwich.  The carnitas were horrible...very fatty and not flavorful at all.  I couldn't even eat it.  The hubby ordered the two carne asada burrito plate so I decided to take one of his burritos.  Another big mistake. The carne asada was just as bad as the carnitas.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be returning..."
0,Service was terrible.  After waiting forever the bus boy came out to ask if we'd been helped but said he could only bring us water or soda!? The waitresses walked around like we were invisible and the place was not even busy!!!  Margaritas were syrupy & so not worth the $15.00- ugh!!
1,"I always forget Deejai Thai exists because it's tucked away next to the Manor, but it popped up on my radar screen one Wednesday night, and away we went.  \n\nI like going to Deejai a little bit later on a weeknight because parking is easier in the strip mall lot, and when it's full, it feels full.  Honestly, the crowd usually makes it or breaks it for me.  The night we went most recently, it was about half full and felt energetic, and I didn't feel like I needed to scoot my chair all the way in til it hit my spleen to get some room.  However, I do love that it's dark and romantic... because then I don't have to wear makeup.\n\nThe service was prompt as usual, and I got the chicken pad thai ($12.99) while the fella got beef pad see u ($12.99).  Since it was a Wednesday night, one of their bottles of wine was half off, so we got that, too!  I was in the Clean Plate Club after about 20 minutes of inhaling my dinner, and the fella said his was good but mine was better.\n\nI really need to do a better job of remembering that Deejai is out there.  Now if only I could figure out how to pronounce it..."
1,Al Pastor - with JUST cilantro and raw onion. - Don't let anyone tell you there is another way to eat these orgasms in your mouth. Enjoy!
1,I am a big fan of Egg Works. My family come here often. The service is pretty fast considering how busy it is on weekends. I enjoy the breakfast items and there are many to choose from. I tried a burger once and decided to stick to breakfast. I really like the Sunrise mountain. Very big portions and all around breakfast.
0,big platters of tasteless food.
0,"Judging by the other two reviews on here I can see that I'm not the only person living in this neighborhood who wonders why their corporate office doesn't clean t his place up. I mean, you can see how busy they are 24/7. This place has got to be a money maker. What's with the kid and her mom who sell candy every day just in front of the entrance to the store? Doesn't Circle K sell candy? Isn't this panhandling? Where's security? Why do the homeless, mentally ill, and the local meth heads feel so at ease to congregate here and bother customers? WHY is the soda fountain ALWAYS in disrepair?? WHY is the Debit/Credit option always down at the register? WHY during their busiest times is there only one cashier on duty?? Why are employees allowed to smoke outside in front of the store on their breaks??  WHY are the gas pumps so tagged up with gang graffiti that you can't see to use them?? How many complaints does this store need before they do something to make it better? I wish the Mexican grocery store across the street would get purchased by Quik Trip. If they built a QT across from this dump, this store would go under. The difference is like night an day. This store is not only dirty, poorly managed, and understaffed, but always in a state of disrepair. You would never see this at a QT."
0,This place is absolutely the worst decision you could make. If you feel like being trapped in a year long commitment with no way out other than paying exhorbitant fees this is the place for you. The staff is aggressive and unfriendly and they will not work with you on changing the terms of your membership. Avoid this place at all costs.
0,"Read all of the positive reviews so we went to Le Peep this past Mother's Day. Very disappointed!  The food is very average. We ordered the sausage skillet, omelet and pancakes.  All were over cooked. The decor is very dated and desperately needs an update.  Will not be returning."
0,"If I have to review the food alone, I will give it a one star.  The service is prompt and courteous so I'll give it an extra one star.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.  We had a reservation and was seated promptly.  The waiter came and greeted us, gave us the menu and everything went well.\n\nAppetizer: We started with the Alp & Dell Cheese Fondue which is a white wine and Gruyere, Raclette and Fontina Cheese Fondue. It tasted two dimensional, exactly garlicky and salty.  The raw cauliflower and carrot which I usually love to eat tasted bitter with the cheese.\n\nSalad: We went with California Salad which is mixed salad greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  The salad came very watery, very very sweet and it was swimming in the dressing. We could not even finish it off.\n\nMain Course: This is the worse of all the courses. We picked the pacific rim cooked in coq au vin broth.  It came with Teriyaki Marinated Sirloin, Citrus Pork Tenderloin, Shrimp, Chicken, Pot sticker, Mushroom, and Veggies.  We deliberately chose coq au vin broth even though it cost more because we read here that it's worth it. Everything tasted bland and that citrus pork and teriyaki sirloin tasted very weird, sour and salty and not in a good way at all.  The chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland.  It really tasted like boiled chicken meat that's a bit salty. Their solution?  Dip it in our sauce: Teriyaki, Sweet and Sour and Yogurt based curry sauce.  The sauces tasted like cheap sauces you can find in a bottle in any grocery stores. It has no character, no complexities,  very very disappointing.  Oh yeah, this is what our waitress said,  just cook everything about 2 minutes or so, don't worry if you don't time it correctly, it's impossible to overcook anything here, just leave it on the pot and that's fine.  This is not just the cooking instruction for  our table.  We can hear that every table get the same cooking instructions from different waiter/waitress.  The problem is not overcooking for us, but it just tasted bland.\n\nDessert: We chose the Smore with Dark Chocolate Fondue.  This is the best part out of this horrible feast.  It comes with Strawberry, Graham Cracker, Marshmallow, Cheesecake, Pound Cake and Rice Crispies to dip it with. First, the strawberry was fresh, marshmallow was great, graham cracker was crunchy.  Now come the bad part, the part that they had to make: The rice crispies was kinda stale, the pound cake was crumbling like a week old cake, and the cheesecake was just meh.  We suddenly realized that the part that was good, they did not have to make( ie: the strawberry, the cracker and the marshmallow).  The part that they had to make tasted bad( ie: the crispies, cheesecake, pound cake).  \n\nWe do not mind splurging on our foods on special occasion.  We realize that it takes a lot of efforts to make special dishes.  This is seriously lacking in everything, cheap basic material for the food, horrible taste, and no cooking method involve at all by the kitchen.  Why are we paying that much again?  I don't mind paying $100 for a meal if it is cooked properly and tastes great.  It's not the price at all, it's just there is no value to this meal."
0,"The pad Thai  is too soggy and wet, if a Thai restaurant can't make a reasonable Pad Thai, then they don't have good Thai food.\nI went there twice, never want to go 3rd time,   the other rice noodles are tasteless also.\nThe services are slow.\nBut they have ok appetizers."
0,"1st trip about 2 months ago was pretty good.  Was there again today and service was poor.  Ordered eggs over medium, were served like they were hockey pucks...told the waitress and she said she would get new eggs for us, but left the our plates on the table for the next 10 minutes letting the ham, hash browns and English muffins get cold.  Why would they NOT put the plates back under the warmer in the kitchen until the eggs were ready?  Manager came over and said she understood the eggs were made incorrectly, I asked her why they would leave our plates on the table...she said 'sorry' and that was it.  Did not offer to offset the bill, nothing, nada, zippo - so I just had to limit my tip and left a note on the receipt saying \""Cold food today - not good\"".\n\nHow do you screw up eggs?  Ask US Egg....very disappointing."
0,"I came here thinking I'd give it a show as someone had told me it was pretty good. I should have known better considering I'm not overly fond of chain restaurants. There are some good ones out there and I thought maybe this could be a good one to catch the football games at on occasion come August. Yeah not even close.  They have a multitude of televisions but they are all small. Not a single large screen tv in the place and that was disappointing. The wait staff was not on their A game and it took us forever to get our order in and to get our check at the end of the meal. \n\nI ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with sweet potato fries. The pesto tasted like it came from one of those packets you get at the grocery store. It was very runny and mediocre. The fries tasted good but they were swimming in butter. I know I asked for them sweet (you get a choice of sweet or salty), but I wasn't expecting there to be butter pooling on my plate from them... gross!!!  My mom got a bacon cheeseburger and while the bacon was plentiful (as in way too much.. I know what am I saying right) it was well under cooked. She had to pick 90% of it off and by the time she was done there was a pile of bacon on her plate sky high.\n\nTheir beer selection seems to be a good one and although I didn't have any they had a lot of local choices as well as the usual. So I give them an extra star purely for the beer list. Overall I will not be back here!!"
1,"It was my honey's bday and surprised him with a Vegas adventure. I booked with NYNY because the location was primo and the price was not as ludicrous in comparison to the Wynn, Venetian, etc. for Memorial Day weekend. We arrived in Vegas at 3pm on Friday. We were afraid there would be a slew of people at check-in for the holidays. Luckily, there was no line, and the lovely desk lady quickly checked us in, upgraded us to a nicer room with a view for $15 extra, provided us info on things to do around the place, and gave us coupons for 2 complimentary drinks and shopping discounts around the NYNY hotel.\n\nWe went up to the rooms. OK. They aren't Wynn quality or anything like that. But the place was clean, spacious enough, and had all the basic amenities you need (AND free water! A must in Vegas!). It did not come with a mini fridge though, so forget about bringing back food. AND, I did notice the cable channels SUCKED. Very little channels. The NYNY commercials were cheesy and adult oriented. More class please! What if kids were flicking through the channels???\n\nAnyhoo. Aside from that, we had free access to the pool and fitness center. I didn't swim in the pool, but it looked big and nice. I did go to the fitness center. It had everything you needed to get a good workout. Cardio machines, free weights, weight machines, mats, balls, etc. It also came with additional free amenities like bottled water, headphones, and the cardio machines came with your own TV. The views were nice because it overlooked the pool. I really enjoyed that part of the hotel. Additionally, for an extra $10, hotel guests can get get access to the spa amenities such as: jacuzzi, steam room, treats, etc.\n\nOverall, I think the stay was pretty nice. It wasn't a 5-star experience, but the atmosphere, freebies, and price made it a good 4 star rating."
1,"Having eaten my way through most of the AYCE sushi places in Vegas, I can say that some definitely shine bright (more creative rolls, better fish selection, etc), but Sushi-mon wins every time in overall value, consistency and freshness.\n\nAdmittedly, I have history here, so this review may be somewhat biased. I've been coming here since the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always find myself back here. It sort of has a \""Cheersish\"" vibe for me.\n\nThe main reason I love it here is that I know I will get fresh, consistent product. I have never received anything less than that. At a lot of places in town, you may receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has beautifully fresh fish. \n\nIn addition, they are FAST! I order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \""go-to\"" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean. \n\nBut on to the food...\n\nAs I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and hated it, try it here. Trust me.\n\nThe rolls are no joke as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \""hand roll\"" form. I like to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well. \n\nOk. That's enough. This review is making me hungry. I'll see y'all there!\n:::insert Cheers theme song here:::"
0,"The massage was ok. It's what I expected from a place like this. \n\nWhen I paid and asked for change of a $20 bill so I could tip she just stared at me.  I asked the other lady for change and she said she didn't have any.  I said I would go get change and be right back, then all of a sudden they could break my 20.  Long story short my tip wasn't good enough for her.  She confronted me about it and then showed me a sign that said if I was happy with my service to tip $15-$20.  The service only cost $20.  I'm not tipping 100%.  Won't ever go back there!!"
1,"I really like scooptacular. Nice friendly staff, cool kid friendly atmosphere, and delicious ice cream! I especially appreciate all the thank you cards hanging around from places that Scooptacular has donated their treats. I love the Laveen Concrete Mix ice cream!"
0,"Even as a cheap option this place is a bad option. 2 weeks ago I ordered their large take out pizza, when I walked in to pick up the place smelled awful...well I came to find out that smell was spoiled cheese because my pizza tasted of it too. I would be very worried about a place that serves spoiled cheese and is completely ignorant to what spoiled cheese looks and smells like."
1,"I went here in Christmas Eve with my family. We were a little skeptical at first as their weren't many other customers but we had an amazing time. Our server was named Sam and was very funny and engaging with us. He had to deal with 9 very loud people and was making jokes with us, we even asked him to take a picture with us at the end.\n\nOur chef-Romo did a wonderful job engaging the kids at the table and allowed all of us to be involved in the experience. Romo also did a great job cooking!\n\nThe only downside was paying 8 additional dollars for the Birthday special which wasn't more than a song and some fruit. \n\nI've been to many places like this, but this place have us a good family atmosphere and cared about their customers!"
1,"This place is an absolute gem! I so wish we had one in Portland! The vegan wings are so so so so so so so good! You have to try them.. wing lovers will unite on this sensational menu item. We also tried two of the bowls...both of which are outstanding. If you're looking for a great vegan, gluten free joint... that's casual and tasty.. this is so your place."
0,I had to return the Fish I purchased for dinner just a few hours ago because it smelled bad. I was not able to smell bad fish over the counter. This place still smells clean. This is the second spoiled fish purchase for me from here. The manager said yes that fish smells so the fish monger knowingly gave me bad fish.\n\n I will still stop in for produce or dry goods because I like them here but I can no longer trust them for fish.
1,"***short version***\n\nthe wagyu rib cap was the best steak i've ever had. and the service was excellent. our server, katy, made the dinner a complete 5-star experience.\n\n***long version***\n\nas i walked in i asked our server if i could finish my can of beer at the table. \""sure\"", katy said flashing a smile. yeah, i'm cheap and i hate spending money on expensive steaks and drinks. i was set to order one of the cheapest things on the menu (kobe burger at $20), when i mentioned to her that i've been disappointed every time i ordered a $30+ steak. she replied that their rib cap was the best steak she's ever had. she tried to explain what a rib cap was, but her friendliness was so disarming that i ordered it without fully understanding where on the cow the meat was coming from. i normally like medium, but i know medium-rare should be the way to go. she suggested something in between: medium-rare plus. i doubted her cooks' skills but she assured me that their temperature control was outstanding.\n\nwhat's a rib cap? i had to look it up when i got home. on a chunk of roast there's the familiar rib-eye loin and then that layer of fat along the top. when you cut away the eye, there's quite a bit of meat still attached to the fat. that's the rib-cap.\n\nout came the meat, and i immediately cut into it. it wasn't running blood, but it was still full of that that happy pink center you expect from a gently-cooked steak. (medium-rare plus!) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib-cap: the robust flavor of the rib-eye, the tenderness of a filet, and the mouth-melting fat of pork belly. a trifecta worth the $60. the sides were awesome, but i couldn't stop loving each bite of my steak.\n\nkaty checked in, and i was impressed that the product delivered. she noticed my can of pale ale was out, and suggested i try an ipa. wine just wouldn't do with this steak, and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl. i mentioned to the server extraordinaire, that the only problem i had with the rib-cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth, the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished. \n\nkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo, palate cleanser. so my last bite was just like my first."
0,"This store has really gone down hill over the past few months with the loss of some key friendly employees. Service is average. The pharmacy is still a nightmare. It's sad because this is the most popular and busies frys in the system. I wish they would get it together back to the standards it has been \""famous\"" for!!!"
1,"It seems that Vegas has ALL the Le Sportsac stores, whether it is a regular store or an outlet. Where are the ones down here huh???? I don't even think SCP has it.\n\nThey are coming out with tons of designs which give me a migraine. I prefer the classic colors. However, I really like the new sizes and styles, but they hardly carry any in the classic colors. Most of them are the florals or the animal prints -- just too much for me.\n\nOtherwise, it's a great store!"
1,"Good and fast Chinese food at a reasonable price.\n\nThere aren't that many options for a quick and cheap lunch in this area, but this one satisfies both needs for right around $5.  It isn't absolutely amazing and the lunch portion sizes aren't near as much as a lot of the cheap Chinese places are, but do you really need a to-go box at lunch?\n\nI took a friend and we got the sesame chicken and the general's chicken.  It comes with rice and an egg roll.  Both entrees had a decent fried crunchy texture and a note of fruit.  The sauces were a little thinner than most places but I don't mind not being dowsed with a ridiculous amount of cornstarch.\n\nIf in the area and not trying to deal with nuances of Piscies \""all you can eat\"" sushi lunch special I will be back.\n\nFYI, take a look at the pic that had been submitted if you want an idea of portion size."

1,"I just got back from staying the weekend here, (25th-28th) my husband and I as well as my friends stayed in this hotel to celebrate my birthday weekend. While we checked in we were worried we would not be able to stay on the same floor as our friends (whatever rep is available next is the one that will book your room) this young man Brian from Pittsburg heard our concern and walked over to the rep that was helping my cousins, he went out of his way to find out what floor they would be in. As he came back he notified us that we would all be in the same floor. I was soo excited when I heard the news, we normally have to beg people to do this for us. And the one time I don't ask we get what we want. Brian was extremely helpful he even offered us a sky view., which I'm sure is proper procedure but he wasn't pushy about it.  Check in went very smooth, thanks!\n\nWhen we got into our rooms we were overwhelmed! The view was absolutely gorgeous, the Go Deluxe rooms are so beautiful! And the bathroom was so fun! My fav color is pink & of course there was a touch of pink in there. Call me lame but I have never seen a tv built in  mirror! Wow! This room had it all!! \n\nMy experience here was amazing, from the friendly staff including the cleaning ladies, bartenders.. Everyone was super chill & nice! I will say parking is a hassle. There are toooo many spaces for valet, and then the hotel only narrows it down for rewards customers. I was a little offended. So much empty space in valet but other customers weren't good enough to park there.  Something needs to be done about that, we parked in nearby hotels just to get to ours. If parking was not an issue I would give flamingo a 5 star. Besides that, I'm sure we will be back!!"

0,"My wife and I had breakfast here on a Monday morning before our flight home. We got seated immediately and had fast, happy service, and that's where the enjoyable portion of this review ends.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best, and after having dined in Le Village Buffet next door I'm certain they share the same kitchen. This means you're paying more for your single serving breakfast that you would be paying the $15 for the buffet. I suppose if you really wanted to avoid the lines at the buffet and didn't mind shelling out for each glass of juice you wanted this would be alright. We'd dined at the buffet on Saturday morning and felt the lines (that really weren't that bad) would be worth waiting on rather than pay a premium for the same food."

1,"Your standard gas and mart.  Very clean!  As some of you may know, the road from Phoenix to Las Vegas is fairly devoid of services for much of its length.  So, while driving in the dead of night, spots like these are oases.  Drinks, chips, gas, and bathroom, all with friendly service.  Thanks!"
0,"Fast food must not be fast anymore...?\n\nAfter a 15 minute drive through wait, I drove up, smiled and said hello.

1,AWESOME DIM SUM!!!! Good price and amazing selection. My only complaint is that it's a mystery at times what you are getting as some of the server's are not good with speaking english. Maybe some pics with explanations would help. I highly recommend eating here.
1,Can't ever go wrong here guys!  If you want to feel like you're in Maui eating breakfast go here!  Same great food and service!
0,"We went there based on all the great reviews on Yelp.  What a disappointment.  First we arived about 5:45 on a Saturday evening.  There were at least 10 empty tables but they made us sit in the bar for 10 minutes!  I  ordered a glass of cabernet and the bartender never gave me a wine list or asked me what I preferred--just have me the house wine which was mediocre at best.  The bread was very good.  However, I had the Orange Roughy piccata which was swimming in lemon.  The fish was tough and very chewy.  Orange Roughy should be tender and melt in your mouth.  Another guest had the chicken parm and she was happy with it.  My husband had the baked penne which was overcooked.  We won't be returning.  Very disappointed.  Service was good though other than the bartender."
1,"This place is really 3 stars, but because it brings me a sense of nostalgia, I will be generous and give it 4.  3 of us guys ordered 1 1/2 pounds of meat- Chicken, Beef and Pork. \n\nI thought it would have been carnitas, however it was more of a pork chop.  Chicken was great, and the beef was just eh.  The best part about it all were the thick, delicious homemade tortillas. Delicious!!! \n\nA tip that we have always done since high school- switch out the pico de gallo with guacamole free of charge. Use the salsa from the chips and salsa and you are all set. Squirt some lime on your fajita and bam, you have the best tasting fajita this side of the I-17.\n\nPretty reasonable and tasty and for sure filling, just beware you will smell like what you ate for the next 18 hours after coming here."
0,"Ugh! The worst food ever. Who serves a shrimp taco with cheese? There was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal. The \""Manager\"" was unwilling to comp my meal...they took a measly $3 off. The waitress asked what \""side\"" i wanted and i chose a salad...we were charged for the side when my meal \""came with a side\"". Plus they didn't have the correct vodka for a drink listed on their drink list and they charged us for the more expensive substitute! Hands down, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!! Slow service (even though we were the ONLY customers in place). And let us not forget the worst restrooms ever. For a place with NO customers other than ourselves, the handicap stall was disgusting. Toilet clogged, the sinks haven't seen cleanser in quite some time. Don't waste your time or money!"

1,"If you're looking for a large farmer's market that basically looks as if your local grocer's has spilled onto the street, it'd be best to find another.  If you're looking for a small, intimate, market with fresh EVERYTHING where afterwards you can spend a lovely afternoon walking around Stockbridge, come here!\n\nI can't remember the name of the stall, but I got wonderfully fresh homemade pasta and sauce, a myriad of fresh veg, and of course a tasty treat for after dinner :)"
1,"This place is pretty rad.  They recently finish a 2000sf + expansion and patio expansion.  The food is inconsistently good.  Really good during the days when the daytime bartender is cooking... I know for a fact they use Kraft Ranch.  \n\nMonday night trash talk poker is a blast.  \n\nTues is an awesome trivia night with a funny big guy hosting to a quality crowd.  \n\nWed is college night.  They start off with volleyball at the park across the street then real cheap drinks w college id and karaoke.\n\nThurs night is my favorite.  Beer Olympics!  a Coed tournament with 5 games, pool, darts, shuffle board, beer pong, bags and Gift Certificates for Gold, Silver and Bronze followed by their resident DJ Bon Joke.  He's pretty good. He mixes Karaoke with his videos and  DJ tracks and makes you wanna sing.   \n\nDJ Bon Joke is also the featured entertainment on Friday and Sat.  \n\nFinal Round is probably the only bar in Tempe I'd give 5 stars to."

1,"This is the REAL Las Vegas Outlet! There are a few other lame run down outlets in the Las Vegas area, but make sure you go to this one, LAS VEGAS PREMIUM OUTLET!\n\nWho says there's nothing to do but gamble in Vegas? I personally hate shopping maybe it's a guy thing, but I hate looking at the same crap that's  never on sale. This outlet is great for men! I'm not into men if that's what you were thinking (that's what he said). Let me explain. Most malls are composed of 95% womens products. This is no joke! And the 5% of stores that are not women's I am counting the food court and gift shops that don't even sell clothing. I admit malls are great for guys to go window shopping for eye candy (go on ladies do your thang), but if you want some decent clothes there is no mens clothing! This outlet actually has stores that men will  shop at! Also, unisex clothing stores have a men's section and not just on rack hidden in the back of a women's store. There's nothing more embarrassing than wondering if something is your size and it turns out to be womens clothing. That's a nightmare for a straight guy. \n\nVan Heusen, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Nautica, Calvin Klein, Keith Cole, TIMBERLAND!! One of the last Timberland stores open. Other outlets will only have a few big names and no section, but the premium outlets have what you are looking for. There's too much good stuff! Usually, I only get halfway through the outlet because I have bought too much stuff before I make it all the way through. \n\nIf you are going to shop for reals, the Las Vegas Premium Outlets is for you. If you just want to look around, still go... but you should buy something because the prices are awesome. This is a must stop everytime you go to Las Vegas. The only bad thing is you may freeze your ass off in the winter and you will melt like a ice cream in the summertime, because this is an outdoor mall. I still don't get what the designers of this mall were thinking! Outdoor mall in Vegas?\n\nWritten via blackberry"

My wife and I went an hour early for the latest visit and had a great time at the surrounding bars and restaurants. Will definitely come back to see more shows here."

1,"I simply cannot imagine the reviewers that give Joel Robuchon's restaurant in Vegas anything but five stars have any real experience with fine dining. I have eaten a wide range of Michelin starred restaurants and NOTHING compares to Joel Robuchon's brilliant cuisine. Days later, my better half and I were still discussing the foie gras appetizer and the veal cheek main course. And the bread cart... oh, the bread cart.... really, you just have to see it to believe it. It will change your life, seriously.\n\nThe service was also impeccable--timely, yet never intrusive, and the sommelier went out of her way to provide us with a pile of information. \n\nOverall, this dinning experience was nothing short of masterful."
1,"We dined here at 5:00 or so on a Wednesday, the place was pretty quiet when we arrived but filled up quickly.\n\nTivoli Village is a bit too fussy for my taste, as is this place.  I have to say the food makes up for the fussiness, though!\n\nI got to taste the following:\n---  Small plate - pork belly on white grits.  This was just outstanding.  The grits were surprisingly good!\n---  Tri-tip Steak.  The star of the evening (wish I had ordered it).  Perfectly cooked with just the right sear on the outside.  The accompanying peppercorn sauce was just fabulous.\n---  Flat Iron Steak:  This was also quite good, although not nearly as tasty as the tri-tip.  Be careful ordering anything less than medium if you don't like a bloody steak.  This was undercooked compared to a normal medium-rare, but I didn't mind.\n---  Trenne pasta:  We had no idea what \""trenne\"" was, so we Googled it.  It's kind of like penne, but it's crunchy.  Weird.  Came with pieces of steak and kale, it was very good.  Be on the lookout for trenne!\n\nThe pricing here is very reasonable given the location and atmosphere.\n\nThe service was impeccable.\n\nOne nit to pick:  what's with the guys standing with their arms crossed, looking at the customers?  Are they bouncers or what?  Some muscle-bound fellow in an extremely ill-fitting suit was standing in the corner, glowering in our general direction.\n\nI headed to the restroom and sure enough, another primate in a bad suit was standing in the corner.  NOTE:  I was wearing jeans, just sayin'\n\nI guess they're supervisors or something - I dunno, watching them watching me put me off my feed a little bit...  :)"

He just did not want to help me at all, not an apology, not any kind of compensation. and When I ask him what is he gonna do for me. He said we cannot do anything and right after that he asked smiling is there anything else he can do. He was really laughing from inside right at my face. Ryan Gregory is really a piece of sxxt !!!

1,"What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. \n\nThe seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D"

We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!"
0,"Well, once in a lifetime is enough for this I think. I have been there multiple times when friends and family come to visit and am disappointed each time. If you are under 21 they do not even let you come into some of the hotels, not even to get advertised food specials or use the restroom! Not that I would eat the food that came out of any of those hotels but just a heads up! Everything is overpriced, but not as much as the strip. You can get bottle Corona for $2 at some bars which is a deal I have to admit compared to the $9 beers on the strip.\n\nThe whole street is filled with kiosks selling shirts and other little things, nothing too exciting except for one that does spray paint art in layers live, which is really cool but it draws a big crowd of rude tourists so it's not a place to be for any amount of time. There are also impersonators (some good some should rethink their costume) that will take a picture with you for a \""mandatory donation.\"" I have never done the zip line but it is quite spendy for just going over a bunch of people, not that good of a view! \n\nThe overhead lights is the ONLY reason this dump gets 2 stars, I have to admit that it is pretty cool and I have never had a visitor say that they didn't like it. It is short though but what can you say, it's free which isn't a common price in Vegas.\n\nBeware if you go, this is where the transients, pimps, prostitutes and loonies hang out! If you like people watching in it's craziest it is entertaining but don't go down a back ally. It is near the Greyhound station as well as the slum of Vegas and the homeless shelter. Not a good area to be in at night! Also getting to the highway is an ABSOLUTE nightmare. They have no signs and they expect you to remember random almost ally streets to find it."

And everything is really cheap!\n\nInsiders Tip - I have been several times.

0,"First, let me tell you that I had had their pho and their spring rolls a couple of times now. Yes, their service is HORRIBLE, they throw the menus on the table and do not speak or smile but their food is decent (I am speaking as to flavor only). Today for lunch we were extremely DISGUSTED and disappointed. I looked up their number to make sure they were open and I happened to start reading their reviews although like I said, I 've been there before. One of the reviews said \""the restrooms are disgusting I wonder how their kitchen looks.\"" That REALLY stuck with me but we were already committed (it was three of us) so off we go! We ordered the usual. Two bites away from finishing my spring rolls I find a thick black hair threaded into the spring roll! Ewww! The fact that it was deep in there and not just lightly sitting on top made it even worse. My friend says \""that's gross. Want mine? Mine is from a different batch. What're the odds? Like one in one thousand!?\"" (they had forgotten his spring rolls so they came 10 minutes after mine). I did not accept his offer. He began eating his very carefully! SURPRISE SURPRISE! Half way into his spring roll he finds a LONG BLACK AND THICK hair. I couldn't believe it. What the ___?! Please see the pictures. It makes me regret EVER eating there. I will never be back. I can forgive ONE hair in the food, fine, it happens but TWO?! IN THE SAME MEAL? SAME SEATING? Clearly they don't give  a crap about cleanliness. I REALLY do wonder what their kitchen looks like. I get up show it to the cashier who i believe is the owner and he takes the spring rolls and takes them back to the kitchen. He comes back and says \""sorry 'bout that. Want me to take one roll off you bill?\"" I explained to him that it was 2 different orders so he took 2 off. A restaurant who does not take pride in their cleanliness and sanitary issues does not deserve my business. I will never be back."

However, I do suggest staying at a hotel on the strip or you will end up trying to hunt down parking just to get to the monorail, which happened to us this trip."

While the service isn't *exceptional*, the price is right and everything is well maintained. I'm sure the \""Black Card\"" membership is perfect for many customers (tanning and aqua massages included, plus free guest daily), I found I wasn't using the additional services. I don't tan or use the massage tables and I rarely bring people with me to work out. But I made a one year comitment to the higher price, which was fine. That was my choice and I can live with cost. The problem came when I tried to downgrade to the $10/month option after my year commitment ended. The gentlman I spoke with told me that I would have to pay a $50 \""activation fee\"" (which was waived when I opted for the year commitment). An \""activation fee\"" after having been a member for 14 months? That's sort of insane after also paying a $40 membership fee each year. When you add in the cost of activation fee and membership fee, I've been paying approximately $28/month. There are plenty of options for health clubs in the $30 range that will even include pools & fitness classes (zumba, yoga, spin, etc.), which Planet Fitness does not offer. \n\nAgain, I think there are many customers who can benefit from the black card membership. I'm simply saying that I don't think it is asking too much that someone who fulfilled the terms of their commitment not be taken advantage of when they are trying to continue their membership at a price that fits his/her needs."
0,"This place has decent food but I am surprised by the people who gave it 4 or 5 star rave reviews. It's not bad, but it's nothing special either. \n\nI went in on Sunday for a late lunch with 3 other people. We all liked our food but agreed that it was pretty much the same as any other Mexican restaurant. I was a little disappointed since the menu did not have a lot of choices and what was there was pretty basic. One of the people at the table ordered the combo plate they were told that they were out of tamales so she had to sub another taco. So, the four of us got chicken rolled taquitos, beef fajitas, carne con chile, and tacos. Wow, real exciting stuff. \n\nThe pluses for this place are the variety of salsa that come with chips before the meal and the free sopapillas. Again, nothing really wowed my taste buds, but both were a nice touch. \n\nThe waitress was very friendly but the service was spotty. She refilled our drinks before they were even empty but failed to notice that we did not have napkins or silverware until we pointed it out to her... after our meals had been brought out. \n\nOverall I didn't hate it; but I will not be back again since there are other Mexican joints closer to my house that have the same boring food so it really is not worth the drive for me."

1,"We recently had our wedding reception in the private room at McMullan's.  It was outstanding.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The food was delicious.  Best of all, the prices were soooo reasonable.  Our budget was tiny but we were able to have a full dinner including an open bar for our guests!\n\nBrian, the owner, stopped in to make sure that our party was going well and that everything was to our liking.\n\nI picked McMullan's off Yelp and I'm sooo glad we did.\n\nThey went out of their way to make sure that everything was perfect, including creating a makeshift cake stand for my wedding cake.\n\nWe had the irish sausage rolls which were phenomenal, as well as stuffed mushrooms, chicken pot pie and the fish and chips.  HIGHLY recommend the fish and chips.\n\nMy only complaint was that the main entrees weren't served at the same time so people gobbled up the fish and chips in 2 seconds and some people had to wait 10 minutes before the next entree came out.  That could have been timed a little better so that everyone could have gotten some of everything instead of it being staggered so much.\n\nAll in all though, I highly highly highly recommend McMullan's."
1,"This is a great service, but lately the quality of shows are dwindling fast.  Well we have watched most of the good miniseries.  Not much left, so I hope that new programming in coming soon."
1,"I really loves visiting here! The staff was really friendly and seemed like they really nailed their work environment! It was very refreshing to see how everything operated. I kind of accidentally found this place, thought they were actually going to have a store. Instead it was their master head quarters. \n\nThey had a lot of great luxuries that other companies wouldn't provide their staff with. Not to mention the things they have access to- like getting their car serviced while at work is a definite plus. They also have a always open door policy where their high up work on the same level as everyone else. That was nice to see! The only ones who have closed offices are the lawyers and the licensed life coach. I thought that was pretty cool to have."
1,"You know what this place deserves a great review from me. Yeah, yeah I know what you're thinking \""Jamie it's just a Red Lobster\"". It is a Red Lobster and I am a regular customer here because my dad loves this place and honestly I don't have anything bad to say about them. Their service has always been spectacular; all of their wait staff have been nothing but fun and friendly to my very dysfunctional family. I've had many items on the menu and have enjoyed everything. Not to mention, they have a great bar. Where else can I get a double sized frozen margarita with my seafood meal? This place handles large parties gracefully and easily splits checks when needed. This Red Lobster has served me and my family well for years. I love the different \""fest\"" seasons too, Lobster Fest being my favorite!"
1,"This is my regular pizza take-out place and I love that this tiny little eatery pumps out some pretty great pies!  We order pretty much the same thing each time we go... Vegetarian pizza (loaded with veggies) and a saporita.  I am not a fan of the calamari but am very much a fan of the tiramisu which is DELICOUS.  Gabriel, who I am assuming is the owner, is always friendly and gets us in and out quickly.  This is a consistently good go-to place for pizza."
1,I love this spa! The zen room is really peaceful and I love the sauna and showers! The body wash they have there smells marvelous!
0,"I think we went in to this with high expectations (which is what happens when you're rated so highly as a buffet / venue).  Unfortunately, we weren't thrilled with the food, the layout, or really anything about our dinner.\n\nWe saved Bacchanal for our last meal in Vegas after being there for a week...  I'm disappointed that we did.  The food wasn't spectacular - in fact, I'd say pretty much everything was average at best.  The meatballs were absolutely the best thing on the whole list of food that we tried.\n\nI found that some of my seafood was loaded up with salt; not what I'd expect.  Let the flavours run through from light seasoning, and just high quality ingredients...  \n\nThe ribs were dry and the flavour wasn't outstanding in general.\n\nPizza was fairly good, so I will give them that.\n\nBut everything was fairly mediocre other than the meatballs...\n\nI have tried to think if it was just because the price was what made it less than amazing... but I don't think so.  I think that if it were $25, I'd have felt the same.  During our trip, we did one other buffet, and also a Brazilian Steakhouse, but of these were better than our Bacchanal experience."
0,"I only have 1 word to describe this show - STUPID!  \n\nIt was the most boring show I've ever attended in Vegas!!  Wait, let me rephrase that - it was the most boring show I've ever attended in my WHOLE life!!!  You'd think the light, sound, music, and the drum would make it a fun show, but NO, it was loud, dreary, and silly.  They couldn't come up with interesting costumes that they just decided to throw paint on the performers?  And the toilette paper at the end........ what the fudge???  I felt like we were in a high school gymnasium.  \n\nThis is a show that even if given free tickets I would not go see again.  What a waste of money and time that was!!!!  I wanted to beat up that taxi driver who told us this was a good show.  Never will I trust a taxi driver's recommendation again!"
1,Very good breakfast (Mexican omelet) and employees were welcoming and friendly. I will diffidently return on my next trip to Vegas
1,"Shake, Shake, Shake!  Amazing shakes!!! Cute place. good lunch specials and kids meals. The staff is very friendly!  Give them a try!"
1,"Our large team of developers and testers had a class there last week. Our cooking ability was mixed, to put it mildly. I think everyone had a great time and the food was surprisingly good considering the uneven competence of the preparers (I'm solidly in the low end of that spectrum).\n\nIt was very relaxed and Chef Harrison and his assistant Chance did a capable job in getting us organized and functional. The only problem was that I sometimes had no idea what I was doing and the chefs were busy with other people. So I ended up standing idle for a lot of time. I wouldn't fault them for that: our group numbered 16 and I think it was just too many people to whip into shape so quickly.\n\nI would recommend them for classes and suggest that 8-10 would be a more appropriate group size to get the most out of what they offer."
0,"Just returned from a very short and uninspired stay here.  This place is so mismanaged I am surprised it is still open.  From the horrible check-in to the poorly run restaurant(if you're going to have a buffet on Sunday ya gotta refill the food) to the checkout this place stinks!  $24 Resort fee which includes use of the pool and star gazing(they charge you to look up!?) is lame.  The service and professionalism is completely missing.  In fact it is hard to tell if anyone is really working at this place.  Don't get me wrong the setting is very nice, rooms very nice but it is like a self-service resort.  No towel service to speak of.  Pool side drink service weak at best.  We had a 3 hour dinner(not by choice) and had almost half comped because they just don't have their act together.  The food quality is high as are the prices but they fail on so many levels. Brunch the next morning brought more of the same. Apathy abounds with very few people exhibiting any interest in providing any discernible service.  Avoid this place at all costs and go to a well run spot which there are plenty in this town!"
1,Hand down the BEST BBQ I've had in Las Vegas!  Beats the pants off those chain places and Big Mike is down home good people!  Stop in and git ya some BBQ and homemade cobbler ... you won't leave hungry.
0,"This is a bath house NOT a spa.\n\nBeen here twice. Both times the wet spa areas were so loud that I felt terrible for anyone who actually came here to relax! No effort whatsoever is made to tell guests to use quiet voices.  Additionally, guest and staff voices were so loud outside of the salt and hot stone rooms that it was distracting to those within.\n\nStaff members in at the women's spa both times looked like they barely wanted to be bothered as they handed you the locker tag and slippers.\n\nThe facilities themselves are very nice ~ especially the outdoor co-ed pool ~ but customer service and a relaxing spa atmosphere simply do not exist at this place."
1,"New location seems to be the same as the old location in terms of quality of food. Menu is a bit confusing if you're trying to make your own, but I always get the mochiko bento with kimchee fried rice so that's quite easy to order."
0,"Crackers & Co is a 4.5 only if we're on a 10-point scale.  I went with a party of four and we were all very underwhelmed with the slop served here.  Maybe we went on a bad day, but our disappointment went as far as the quality of the ingredients, which isn't something that typically varies on a day-to-day basis.  \n\nNow, TC Eggington's is a decent breakfast spot.  I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly. \n\nI wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.  I want to help others avoid going here with high hopes of an outstanding breakfast and come away with a belly full of unmemorable food.  What has happened to our standards for a good traditional American breakfast?"
0,I have been to a few locations now and I really liked this one due too the good variety of machines compared to some of the other places I have been too. I UNTILL I had to deal with I wish I new his name bt the manager/trainer here! He is completely unprofessional here I am bringing in a guest for him to hopefully try and get them to sign up for good sake of him getting a new member and me getting a new work out buddy. That's not what happened he tried to make it seem like I was a guest at the gym I pay for every month and made my guest feel uncomfortable which in return made me highly upset! Do I advise anybody to come here and have to deal with this unprofessional man that is a big fat NO!!! don't waste your time.
0,"Short story: Very \""Americanized\"" Mexican food at higher than necessary prices. Watery so so salsa, but the chips were fresh and good. We made the mistake of parking on the side by the dumpsters: Avoid that mistake, they smell terrible! And is it just me but when the employees use the general bathroom in the front of the restaurant is that kind of weird? Going in to use the bathroom I was passed by a cook on the way in and waiter on the way out. Maybe it's just me. For the food: The fish taco is not recommended, fishy and bland. The beef taco, I did think was good. Sorry I didn't find more to like!"
1,"This restaurant was highly recommended in almost everything we read including best restaurant in NC so of course we had to go check it out.  Reservations only.  Very small and comparable to \""How to Cook a Wolf\"" (size wise) in Seattle.  Quaint, cute and romantic.  \n\nI was told they have the best gnocchi in the country.  I've tried lots of gnocchi in my time, but not enough to say it's the best.  I will say the sauce was dynamite.  Spectacular.  It's remained on their menu for the 13 years they've been around so obviously they have it right.\n\nThe bread -- was delicious, but I noticed the tables next to us all got 2 pieces each and we only got one.  I was the only nonwhite person in the restaurant and I hope that's not the reason why.  Then again we were in the south.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope maybe they were just low at the time.  \n\nThe foie gras was not the best ever, but the presentation and the flavors were well prepared and tasty.  I had a mahi mahi with mango puree for my main dish and it was right up my alley!  A Caribbean kick with a tangy sweet balance from the mango.  Delicious and fresh.  \n\nMy friend loved the dessert which was a extra gewy cinnamon roll in a iron cast dish.  I found it to be dry on the outside but I was told it was very most inside and was good.  \n\nMy cappuccino was burnt.  I was disappointed but didn't complain about it.  I figured they do things differently down there and maybe my expectations probably exceeded most coming from the northwest.  I just graciously smiled and fudged a little to the waiter about it being good.\n\nThe restrooms were very clean."
1,"I went here for lunch the other day and I was surprised i hadn't heard of this place sooner. It was great. The bread was delicious, service and ambiance were superb and the pork sandwich I had was amazing. Everything was seasoned just right and I left feeling very full. It is too bad I had to go to work after because there specialty drinks and import drafts looked great. I will go back for dinner very soon."
1,"Hotshotvegas.com is an incredible resource for locals. Anytime I need a weekend \""away\"" or just want to have a fun night on the strip and not drive home - I call Jason.  Hot Shot Vegas always gets me amazing rooms at a super discounted price. Tons of incentives, great customer service and I NEVER have to wait for an answer to my questions.  \n\nHot Shot Vegas is also perfect for when friends are in town visiting and want to go party. I Just send them to HSV and they always have a blast.\n\nHIGHLY recommend this company. Super fun people. Super fast service."
0,"They're incredibly slow. Give yourself extra time if you come here. The first few times I tried to justify it by guessing they must be short staffed or have the \""B Team\"" working but No... Every time I go to this location I wait in line for 7-10 mins before they even take my order. Maybe this doesn't sound very long but I go to Starbucks bc it's fast and easy. If I wanted to wait 15 mins for coffee I would go to some local coffee shop."
1,awesome as usual...:)
1,"It's hard to get great thai food in vegas as we have a lot of good options. Komol however, stand out above the rest. They have a lot of vegetarian options and the servers really work with you to decide what would be best. I definitely recommend the papaya salad, it's delicious! Many more vegetarian options can be found on page 23 and do not hesitate to ask questions!"
1,"I hate going to the dentist, but this staff always makes it much easier to go to the dentist. They are all very friendly and professional. Dr. E Bigos  has been my dentist now for six years and she is awesome. They have done my crowns and a root canal and did an excellent job on all occasions. I highly recommend North Valley Family Dentistry and all of their staff."
1,"I have been to this McDuffy's quite a few times. They are solid. Waitresses are nice, bartenders are nice, the owner is always more than happy to chat with the customers. I have had most of the items on the menu. I liked all of them except for the turkey avocado wrap, but thats my fault because I dont usually like wraps, what was I thinking?\n\nAnyway, cerveza, good service and good food. No complains. I encourage anyone to try it out."
1,"I've been driving right by The Pink Spot for several months now, since I started a new job downtown.  I've been vaguely aware that it was there, but here comes the ridiculous part.  \n\nFor the last week or so, they've had a pink gorilla dancing around on the sidewalk, enticing passers by to visit.  He dances like a maniac, is totally into the gig and I've been laughing every time I pass him each morning.\n\nSo, this AM, I see that pink SOB up in the distance, and I actually succumb to this ridiculous \""guerrilla\"" marketing.\n\nI'm glad I did.  Really cool coffee/breakfast/ice cream shop.  I got a latte, and a breakfast sandwich called a \""clucker\"" or something like that.  Both were fantastic.  The place is nicely decorated, has free wifi, seemed clean and the hipster gal who helped me was nice.\n\nThe service wasn't super quick, and I was the only one in there, so it might get interesting if it were crowded.  Not sure.\n\nAnyway - this is a cool little place to grab coffee/breakfast, and the rest of the reviews on here indicated that the ice cream is pretty insane."
1,"Manager (Owner?) is very chill... Some people might not be used to it. It's a southern thing though! Lol... Anyways! The food is good, I always get either the pulled pork sandwich or the hot link sandwich. The BBQ is the ish!!!!!! I love it, can't get enough. I was reading some other reviews & all I can say is Love it or hate it, I happen to love it. PS: it's really not as bad as people make it seem... Give it a try."
1,"Watch out Villa. You have some serious competition now! \n\nSocial Status is a new urban clothing store in downtown Pittsburgh. They are located across from the Wood Street T Station on Liberty Ave. \n\nThey carry a lot of exclusive hard to find brands like 10 Deep, BBC, Clae, Crooks and Castles, Diamond Supply Co, Gourmet, G-Shock, Ice Cream, Jordan Brand, Nike, Play Cloths, Ralph Lauren, Supra, The Hundreds, Timberland, True Religion, Undefeated and much more. \n\nFor the store to be sort of small they offer a lot of selection and sizes. There are two long racks of clothes. One on each wall in the front of the store. Underneath the racks is were they keep all of the t shirts. In the middle of the store is were all of the sneakers are in cubes on the wall. In the back of the store is were all of the denim is. Next to the denim is a cooler were all of the BBC and Ice Cream clothing is kept. Overall I really dig the design and layout of the store.\n\nEveryone who works there is very nice and helpful and the customer service is great as well. \n\nI will be back often!"
1,I went to this center yesterday to take my CPR class and it was an excellent experience.  Tom is very knowledgable and make learning fun. I highly recommend this place. I'm not going anywhere next time.
0,"This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday, and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.\n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok, sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA, which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out, so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels, but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread, and the waitress asked if I wanted the \""bread basket\""?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins, I believe blueberry and raspberry, a dinner roll, and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.  \n\nOnto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast, that came with Jasmine Rice, a ginger root puree, with baby bok choy, and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger, just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck, though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101, render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy, but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  \""What's wrong?\""  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden, stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.\n\nSo we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10,000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show, my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10,000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread, as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday, spend a decent amount of dough, only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate, accommodating, and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't."
0,"I use to find good stuff here now and again, but now this place seriously sucks. Prices are WAY to high, and the place is small."
0,Worst Applebees I've ever been to... avoid this location! Head to Native New Yorker instead
1,"I have gone to this particular Ace hardware many times.  It has always been very well maintained & organized.  I've always received excellent customer service. I have been there several times to purchase glass for picture frames.  They are always so helpful and make sure to use \""scraps\"" they already have to ensure a lower cost.\n \nI recently needed a large amount of glass cut for a church project.  I had shopped around quite a bit & Ace was by far the cheapest.  The management, particularly Alvina, were wonderful to work with.  They gave me a discount due to having such  a large order, had my glass cut, boxed & invoice written up before I even arrived at the store.  When I had a problem with two of the pieces of glass they immediately replaced them.  \nI will definitely continue shopping at this location and would highly recommend them for any glass you might need."
1,"Stripburger is the perfect spot to dine if you want a fun, outdoor, street-cafe (with full bar!) setting on the Strip. The burgers are solid, the onion strings are addictive, and the shakes are out of sight.  You can always find a place to sit, (been there dozens of times and never had to wait,) and convenient parking at Fashion Show's underground garage.  After we list Trader Vic's at Miracle Mile, this is the spot to enjoy a desert night with friends looking to take in the sights."
1,"I used to go to hurt cafe, but now I have found a place with amazing espresso which is local to me and more convenient. Even if the service was terrible I would still come here because of the quality of the bean , however the service has been great so far and I am happy"
0,"Came here for dinner while traveling on business; I like to check out local sushi places where I go, and this one had pretty good reviews.  \nI would give this place 2.5 stars, if Yelp allowed half-stars, but I decided to round down, rather than up, because nothing really impressed me about this place.\nI ordered a big Kirin Ichiban beer, seaweed salad, small sashimi combo platter, and green tea mochi ice cream.  Turned out to be a big meal for one person.  The seaweed salad was much bigger than most places serve, which confused me, as I didn't want to fill up on seaweed.  It was $8.00, and had a sliver of crab on top of it.  Weird.  The sashimi was rather good; the small platter had 5 pieces each of octopus, albacore, fatty tuna, yellowfin, and salmon.  This is more sashimi than a typical small combo, and the price tag was higher, too ($28.00).  The individual sashimi orders on the menu were 7-8 pieces each, and most were $10.95.  What irked me was the albacore.  It had been seared in a previous life, with some weird spices, then chilled, giving it a hard outer crust and limp interior.  It reminded me of lunchmeat.  Not good.\nNot many sushi places offer the mochi ice cream - I was happy to see they had 'em.  \nOverall, decent quality fish, prices are rather high, chefs are pleasant...better than many sushi places in Phoenix.  I'm still searching for the sushi Mecca in that area, though."
0,"There really are no words to say how bad this place is.  Been here several times out of convenience but it never gets any better just worse.\n\nMy son and I came in and sat at the bar hoping service would be a bit quicker.  There were likely 10 people in the place, 1 waitress, one guy at the grill and someone who later indicated that he was the manager.\n\nafter about 5 minutes, i walked up to what would normally function as an ordering station and the waitress indicated she would be right over...yeah...a waitress to take your order at the bar.\n\nit took another 5 minutes to get our orders in and i noticed several seats of \""left overs\"" sitting to my son's left on the bar.\n\nDrinks came fast enough....then it was the great wait.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes the waitress came over and indicated that our food should  be right out (needless to say, I'm looking at the grill...and the guy can't seem to do more than 2 burgers at a time.\n\n15 minutes later, I've had it.  I've been watching the manager and the waitress chit chat up around the POS system for about 5 minutes without a single order going out.  I go over and indicate that I've been waiting 30 minutes for two simple hamburgers.  They go over to the grill and tell me that it will be a few more minutes.\n\nI look over the bar, its not filthy, but certainly not clean. The left overs that were there when we sat down are still there, and ask to speak to the manager.\n\nThe kid with the greasy hair and mid sized gagues in both ears indicates that in fact he is the manager.  I made it clear that his operation of the establishment were well below par. I pointed out that we had been waiting 30 minutes for 2 burgers and that none of the left overs on the bar had been moved in that time.\n\nI slapped down a 5.00 bill to cover the drinks my son and I had and we walked out.  \n\nI would love to say that this was an isolated experience. However; we've eaten here a half dozen times and its never never fast, frequently we've had to buss the tables before sitting down, and from here on it, I've made the decision that no matter how convenient...its just not worth the agrivation."

0,"Mediocre at best. Everything tasted bland and precooked. I had the chicken enchiladas and my daughter had the three cheese enchiladas, and in both cases the sauces had very little flavor. Although the total bill wasn't over the top expensive, around $24 for two entrees without drinks (we had water), and they don't provide free chips and salsa--you can order them separately for $5, it was too much for the flavors (or lack of) we got. We both wished we'd just left Town Square and gone to a fast food place. It was kind of a letdown to an otherwise fun day of a movie and shopping. The decor looked like it would be a fun place, but the overall mood of the staff and customers was subdued and kind of a bummer. We won't return."
0,"Where to start... This hotel really needs to read up on the basis's of customer service. While thinking about my resent stay at the Las Vegas Hard Rock Casino and Hotel I decided to give you my top eight reasons to not stay at this motel. Here we go...\n1. It would be quicker to take a taxi a restaurant and have dinner, good conversation and enjoy a delicious desert then wait for your car at the Valet.\n2. Explain what a \""non smoking\"" room means to Hotel guest registration\n3. Entering your hotel room without any type of drinking/water glasses and then asking house keeping for them and waiting four hours for delivery\n4. Attempting to order room service and then being placed on hold for 20 minutes\n5. Walking downstairs to Mr. Lucky's restaurant and trying to place an order for take out and then being told no. I said what? They said I would have to sit at a table, order food and then have it boxed for take home... Are you kidding me....\n6. Calling house keeping to clean the room and having them never show up.\n7. Having drinks and gambling with trailer trash, drunk morons\n8. Bad service, bad attitudes, bad smelling and a really bad experience \nIf your looking for a great hotel experience in Las Vegas stay at The Aria just up the road on Harmond."
0,"Went here for dinner  7/18.\nDrinks:Not great.My gf ordered a cranberry and Kettle One.Didnt taste like cranberry juice our server said it was a cranberry cocktail ok no biggie.Ordered a mojito there were so many mint leaves in it she could not drink it ,almost like the whole plant was in the glass,all  you tasted was mint.\nAppetizers:Fried calamari was excellent.Cold seafood platter,oysters ,mussels, crab leg,lobster tail was ok seemed like it had been sitting for a few hours could have been fresher,one of the mussel shells was crushed so I didnt eat it.Bread was excellent.\nSalad:Chopped salad was good.\nEntrees.Prime rib was dried out.Swordfish special ended up being something frozen\non a bed of mushy overcooked bland risotto.Fish was overcooked.No seasoning no taste.Sent it back.I would think being a special it would be fresh,I should have asked my mistake.Still if it werent overcooked and under seasoned it might have been ok.\nService:ok"
0,"In comparison to the SOMA store in St. Armand's Circle SARASOTA, FL, this store pales to comparison and must lose a lot of potential sales.  I know I'll never come back.  I was looking for a couple new bras and post holiday sale PJ's for my sister.  I was greeted asI walked into the store but, nobody offered to help me.  All this time one sales associate was helping a customer and the other three were just hanging out and talking among themselves.  They were dressed in black but, no name tags so, it was confusing to know initially who worked the store.  At the Sarasota SOMA store they wear dressier black outfits and name tags.  I finally flagged down a person and asked her if she worked there.  She was while helpful while her other three co workers did nothing.    She wasn't forthright about the sale of two bras, as she was trying to sell me the ones not on sale and didn't speak highly of the embraceable style, which clearly fit the best on me.  She was also off with my bra size but, my selection was correct.  She didn't offer to size me and none of the staff members had tape measures.  In Sarasota, they all have them around their neck.  My mom, who's not as SOMA savy had a similarly disappointing experience where the manager couldn't be bothered and the part time employer wasn't alerted to a free panty item.  It's too bad as SOMA has a unique opportunity to create a wonderful relaxing, appreciative and completely catered shopping experience for a woman.  I personally couldn't get out of here fast enough and spent less than half of what I'd normally spend.  Their clothes selection is extremely limited and this is the only semi annual sale were so many items seem to still be so high in price or not on sale at all.  During my checkout experience my saleslady was needed in the back to help another customer so she asked another associate to take over my sale.  I visited this woman was not happy to do so as it was not her commission and it was pretty apparent.  The lack of teamwork at the store among the associates is painfully obvious.  They all need to spend a day at the Sarasota St. Armand's Soma and let Yolanda and her team show how it should be done.  The Charlotte women are unfortunately missing out on what should be a fabulous experience#missingSarasotsSoma"
1,"pick a pasta. pick a sauce. pick a cheese. delicious.\n\ni even wanted to buy some of the fresh, refrigerated pasta to take home but the owner advised me against it since i had some other errands and the pasta would sit in my car to long. THANKS and good looking out -- most places would just want to sell you as much stuff as they could, regardless of how fresh it would stay."
1,"Roots is a food truck that has taken a deep hold of the Queen City and me, so I'm just gonna put it out there: This is simply the best food truck I've had the pleasure of dining from to date.\n\nThe concept is simple and part of a growing trend: cooking with locally-sourced foods that are seasonal and allowed to ripen fully to deliver a product with superior quality and taste.  \n\nThe skill in the kitchen is exceptional.  Head chef Craig Barbour  and his team have a laser-like focus on bringing out the best of the season's offerings by combining flavors that boast of freshness and delight the palate with contrasts.  For example, summer's bounty brings heirloom tomatoes roasted and then drizzled with a balsamic reduction and finished with basil.  Or how about a watermelon gazpacho with lime infused creme fraiche?  The preparation here is always elevated just a bit and takes that menu item onto another level.  Another example: Local pork chorizo taco with blueberry chipotle and cucumber fennel salad.  The final product tastes as good as it sounds.  In short, this is a foodie's delight and these guys manage to do it routinely, with gusto.  \n\nToo bad you can only find them for lunch during the mid-week and then a couple special events for evenings.  Do follow them on Twitter and/or Facebook to stay updated.  Craig maintains an e-mail list with a routine listing of the day's menu and there next stops.  Lunch at 3rd and Tryon is available Tuesday thru Thursday.\n\nI'd also recommend their website for information about their whereabouts and their cooking classes, which have an increased following.  If these classes produce anything like a typical menu on their cart, then it's worth your while.  \n\nWhile other food carts tend to have a few specialties and do them well, Roots changes things up and continues to impress.  Despite its small size, this cart has huge abilities.  If you like the local food movement, search these guys out.  If you happen to just stroll by them one day, do your taste buds a favor and try something, anything.  If you like good food, let Roots take hold over you too."
0,I just went here with my fianc\u00e9 to inquire about beers. This review is a 2 because the customer service I received by a manager at the customer service desk. We asked about ordering kegs for our wedding. He was very arrogant and rude. He didn't want to help us not answer any of our questions ...He was talking down to us like we were idiots. Then he called over a very helpful gentlemen that was a lot more pleasant he is the only reason I'm giving Total Wine a 2! Thinking this guy is a customer service employee baffles my mind. He wasn't very helpful and just rude!
0,"All in all, this was a pretty disappointing dim sum experience.  They do carts as well as ordering, so we sat down and placed an order of a few dishes.  It took a really long time for our order to come out, and by that time what we had ordered had come out on carts already.  The food was alright, certainly not spectacular in comparison to other dim sum places in other cities.  The service was standard, but we had to ask for water and tea, as well as our check."
0,"Not much taste in their food. Steak tasted like in was soaking in water, queso dip tasted like paper. Had the steak quesadilla, tortilla had the most flavor of anything."
0,We decided to eat here last week after driving by. We thought we were going to get some delicious authentic Mexican food....oh were we wrong ! The food is terrible. However our server was really nice which is the only reason I am not giving this place 1 star.
0,"I stayed here in the early days when it was a Hilton. It was a great hotel! I then stayed here a month or two before the hotel changed hands. It sucked! Given a good room deal, I thought I would give it one more go -- about a year later. Still sucks. \n\nCareful - they give out a coupon book to use throughout the hotel. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE SMALL FINE PRINT ON THE BACK OF EACH COUPON!!!"
0,"Breakfast is good and good value.  The dinner is horrible. The food is not restaurant quality.  I was surprised that the Carbonara was so heavy and it was something that amazed me that the F&B manager would allow on the menu. It was just so surprising that the quality was so bad. Nothing special what so ever here.  And the waitstaff will fill your table with soda glasses so drink up!   Don't you love it when wait staff bring you the soda when THEY want to rather when YOU need it. \n\nThe food does not match the decor in any way.  The menu is good/interesting/nice, but the quality of the food does not live up to the menu, decor and everything else. \n\nGo somewhere else."
1,"We went here on a recommendation from someone else, and at one point my wife even said she was upset it took us so long to find this place.  Food was good, staff was friendly, and for the amount of food you get, the price is very reasonable.  We'll be back.\n\nAlso, they told us they're open until 9 PM on weekends, and they deliver now.  So don't trust the hours above."
0,"It is the first time I gave 1-rated review, while I normally gave 4-5 stars regardless of service quality. The worst service came from TWC. Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done. All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me \""I can't do this, I can't do that\"". Worst service ever!"
0,"Very poor customer service. Hostess was rude and ignored us when we arrived. When seated finally she had a bad attitude. Also, our server never showed up and we ended up leaving."
1,Very nice. Got the whole chicken and some dates wrapped in bacon and sausage along with crispy polenta. Service was great. Kind of pricey but hey it's Vegas...
0,"The special Pho is not really special. Even when we asked for the right combination for the four of us, they brought out two small bowls that can only feed two of us."
0,"OK, NEVER, NEVER GO HERE ON THE 1st OF THE MONTH!  I made the fatal mistake of going yesterday to pickup a small amount of meat for a BBQ on Labor Day.  When I drove up I noticed so many people outside just sitting around. and I thought maybe they were there to eat, a party maybe?  When I got the door open the place was jammed, and I do mean jammed packed!  I should have left right then and there!  But being a die hard fan of John Mull's I decided with what I needed shouldn't take too long.  What I didn't know was that all these people were getting a month's supply of meat because on the first of the month the food stamps come through.  Dumb me thought they were just getting meat for Labor Day parties!  The orders everyone were placing were HUGE, and each order needed the meat cut, wrapped and boxed.  Some people said they had been there for over 4 hours!  Now, their meat is good, but to stand around in the heat for hours, it's not that good!  I thought how long could my measly order take?  So I waited, slid, and pushed my way to the counter.  Why they don't have a TAKE A NUMBER system I have no idea, but they sure could use one.  \n\nAnyway, when I placed my order instead of just wrapping the meat and letting me pay for it,  she wrote down my order of 2 items and put it in the pile with the rest of the huge meat orders.  I decided to get some sides to go with the meat so shouldered my way to the \""hot plate\"" side of the room and got some potato salad, beans, and mac and cheese.  THEIR SIDES ARE AMAZING!  I proceeded to wait about another hour and finally said I'm outta here because that's a long enough wait for anything and I have a hard time standing with these legs!  The staff was working as fast as they could go, people waiting were really nice about the situation, but it still didn't help the fact that I couldn't stand there with my potato salad in one hand and my cane in the other!  Will I go back to John Mull's?  You better believe it - just never, never on the first of the month!"
1,"I didn't want to yelp about this spot as I always called it my families little secret. But with the line and obivously the huge amount of reviews, it is no secret.  \n\nThis is a stop EVERYTIME I am in Vegas. Food is just amazing. Yeah yeah, Palace Station. I thought that the first time too. But this place is crazy delicious. Half dozen oysters for me with splitting something and that fills me up. \n\nI know I have had the gumbo, jumbalya, etoufee and I want to say I tried something else the last time I was in town but cant remember what it was. However I know my girlfriend looked at me with a food smile I have never seen.  She loved it! \n\nMake it a stop everytime you are in Vegas. Just hope your luck is used on the tables and not showing up here when there is no line."
1,"Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice for a nice restaurant in Vegas without going into fine dining and breaking the bank.\n\nI came here on my first trip to Vegas with my girlfriends because my friend really likes this place.  We sat on the patio and watched the sun go down.  Keep in mind this place has MONEY locale for its great view of the Bellagio fountain show.  It's a little blocked by palm tress but its as good as its going to get for not standing in front of it. Plus this gives you something to do while you watch it.\n\nEveryone ordered steaks while I ordered a Lemon-Thyme Seared Salmon with orzo, peas, leeks, spinach, lemon butter.  The salmon was cooked well but it was...salmon.  Most places don't usually do a lot with salmon but it was plated with a very nice creamy orzo and vegetables. It was a good combination because it brought a little more to the salmon.  Overall though, the orzo and vegetables still stood out over the salmon.\n\nAll in all, Mon Ami Gabi makes nice food at a reasonable price for Vegas.  We will be back this summer as my friend really wants to go again."
0,"So after clubbing and getting back to our room at Aria at 3:30am, my wife and I were trying to find a place to eat that wouldn't require a lot of walking. We asked some one on the casino floor and they pointed us towards Cafe Vettro. After a long day/night of drinking, usually anything greasy tastes like heaven... so on with the review\n\nWe were seated right away around other drunk people as well...good times. After looking at the menu, the only thing that looked appetizing was the steak and eggs. My wife was craving mexican food so the only thing close to that was the chilaquiles. Service was pretty quick and friendly, but we did have to ask for water. Food came out with in 15-20 minutes of ordering...I grubbed pretty hard on my plate, but wished the potatoes were actual hashbrowns, and not whatever it was. My wife had two bites and got grossed out after finding a hair in her food. The waiter took her plate away and offered to make her another one or get something else. He then came back and said the manager approved that there was a hair in her food and we would not be charged for her food. Overall, I thought steak and eggs for $18+ (i believe thats how much I paid for it) would be \""heaven\"" but it was just food to hold me over to the morning. Steak was ok but a little chewy and slightly over cooked. For the value, I don't think it was worth it...sure its convenient if you're staying at the hotel, but I'd just rather order room service or trek to McDonalds for some goodness!!"
0,"I had a couple's massage with my husband at Spa Mandalay. I liked the facilities- the pool/hot tub is beautiful and relaxing- this is why my review is 2 stars instead of 1. The massage itself was not good. My masseuse (male, can't remember his name, but had glasses) asked if I had anything he wanted me to focus on before we got started. I said that I prefer to not have a lot of pressure, on the lighter side is better. He said ok, and we got started. Clearly he didn't listen to me because I was in pain for about 85% of the massage. In particular, my back/shoulder area was torn up. I have had at least 10 massages in various spas in Vegas and other locations, and I haven't had this much pain during a massage. I know the difference between healthy massage where some minor pain occurs and someone just hurting me. He took his thumb and completely dug into my shoulder blade area- several times! Plus, when I was lying on my tummy and he was working on my legs, his hands went way over my comfort zone and all over my butt. Like I said, I have had several other massages and this was not what I was used to. When he had me flip over, he just lifted the sheet completely off of me with no warning (hello! I'm naked in here!) and said \""ok, time for the other side.\"" He was holding the sheet up kind of in front of his face, but I felt very uncomfortable. Usually the masseuse asks me to flip over while the sheet is still on me. \nMy husband said his masseuse (female) was all over the place and didn't use enough pressure, even when asked repeatedly. I will never come back to Spa Mandalay."
0,"I came here with a couple of \""race\"" friends. I asked the guys letting us in what the waiting about 20 minutes in the front of the line problem was. They said we are trying to figure it out... I asked them multiple times what the problem was ...and they said we are trying to figure it out..... I will never go to Marquee again...They let multiple white girls in front of us.... They never let us in and I am a beautiful white woman with a couple of african-American friends. They definitely thought we were up to something.... Because of my friends' race. I am not happy and I will always talk shit on this place. I will never go here ever again .... I talked to the cops right next to the class... And they said they have the right to refuse anybody. WOW!!! Never go to COSMOPOLITAN."
1,"Get the Dill Pickle +Jalapeno Ranch combo!\n\nI freaking love popcorn. Salty, sweet, butter, no butter, etc. etc. It's something about the texture, I think...and Popcorn Girl has great texture, AND flavor.\n\nMy friend and I got to try a few different flavors - ones we didn't purchase (but were just as good) were buffalo wings and loaded baked potato.\n\nPurchased:\n-Dill Pickle + Jalapeno Ranch (small: $4.75): the jalapeno ranch was a suggestion from the girl who filled our order, and I don't know who she is, but THANK YOU\n-Oreo (mini: $4.95): This was SO GOOD. Very rich so the mini size was perfect. I do have to say though after a couple of days (that included driving back from Vegas to LA = direct sun exposure) it tasted the best the day we bought it.\n-Denver mix (small: $6.95): the caramel in this is not my favorite, but I do like the white cheddar flavor - it isn't overwhelming. I wanted to compare this to the Garrett Popcorn mix from Chicago, and Garrett Popcorn wins this round for sure.\n\nHonestly - the 5 stars are for the dill pickle and jalapeno ranch (how many times have I typed out that flavor combination? getting redundant...) Based on the flavors I tried, I think they are on POINT with their savory flavors. The popped kernels aren't as big as Garrett Popcorn, but there is still great texture and I found very few unpopped kernels in the bags.  \nPrices were also very reasonable! the amount you get for the money you pay is honestly a really really good value. I'm seriously going to come here every time I'm in Vegas.\n\nI wish LA had some gourmet popcorn places like this (OTHER than over-priced and mass-produced popcornopolis)."
1,Just had a good meal here. Love the local places when in Vegas. Treat yourself here for good eats then walk next store to Art of Flavors for gelato. Can't go wrong.
1,Quick and friendly service! Went in for a windshield chip repair without an appointment and got it fixed right away and I don't even notice the chip anymore. They are very nice and friendly.  My car is prone to chips so I would definitely come back for repairs or windshield replacement.
1,"Dr Woodbury and his staff are 100% professional.   Everyone in the office from the receptionist to the hygienists to Dr Woodbury are super friendly and super competent.   This is not a big operation with a bunch of anonymous actors...it's just Dr Woodbury, a couple of hygienists and the receptionist.   Dr Woodbury gives you an honest evaluation of your dental health...ie: work that needs to be done vs work that should be done to work that will need to be done in the future.  There's no pushing to get work done.   I went without dental care for many years because I couldn't find a dentist that I felt was honest,  competent, and friendly.   I read reviews of Dr Woodbury on several sites and decided to give him a try...and I'm 100% happy with my choice.  You will be too."
0,"The \""chicken\"" was soggy and a little rubbery.  The ice looked like it was icicles from the side of the building (It was winter when went).  The waiter was a friendly guy and very nice, although I'm not sure what is going on with the food...I've never been there since."
1,Really nice place but I don't believe they serve anything other then poutine after a certain hour. Sad because I'm not a big cheese fan but a must visit place !
1,"Mojito pitchers and yummy tapas!!!!  One of the best bday dinners EVER!!!!  I recommend the bacon-wrapped dates- I was VERY skeptical, but damn... So good!  Don't forget the grilled potatoes!"
0,Not impressed at all! No Wifi internet service in guest rooms. Room service lacked attention to detail and the overall maintenance left something to be desired. Half the lights in the room did not work and the TV was broken. Luckily I was too busy to use the TV. Spend a couple bucks more and stay at the Luxor.\n\n@ben_freedman
0,"This restaurant is modeled after Chipotle, which we love; however, we won't be back for a few reasons.  First my kids did not like the food.  They said the steak was tough.  Second the price was too high.  Lunch was $30 for two adults and two children with no drinks.  The concept is good.  I wish they offered better food for a smaller portion for a smaller price."
0,"I came here for lunch and ordered -\n\nAppetizers: oyster shooter & \""in the shower\"" lobster mac and cheese\nEntrees: HK burger & Steak frites\nDessert: Pineapple carpaccio\n\nOverall experience was not what I expected from the high-rated restaurant and award-winning dishes.  The steak was much too chewy and flavorless.  The pineapple carpaccio had cilantro-flavored ice (bad idea).  I expected more from the lobster mac and cheese but it was just okay, not worth the hype."
0,"Have you ever spat out your sushi? I did.\n\nSushi on Summerlin had some potential.  it has a unique location, there isn't any wait for a table, and they seemed to have good specials.  Unfortunately, I now know why the specials are so low--the quality of the fish isn't as good as it should be.  \n\nWhen we walked in there was a couple in the far corner eating dinner, and the sushi chefs were standing behind the counter watching football on tv.  The one server brought us menus and took our drink orders as we sat ourselves at the counter.  We decided to do the usual sushi test--order the regular items that anyone would order anywhere else and compare it.  This is how it went:\n\nMaguro:  I spat it out.  I couldn't help myself.  The moment it hit my tongue I tasted that rotten fish taste from lack of proper refrigeration.  I hid it in the napkin and moved on.\n\nSnapper: It was okay but it was very bland and the rice wasn't even seasoned.  They just threw rice in the cooker and took it out to use it.  I never use soy sauce with sushi, and I had to with this order.\n\nTempura: nope.  Nope.  Noooooooo.  It was done all wrong, came out burnt (look at the photo I posted) and was flavorless.  Their sauce was just brown liquid. \n\nAfter the experience there, we exited the restaurant and immediately headed to our regular spot to get that bad taste out of our mouths.  Luckily we did.  \n\nIf you are looking for a sushi bar to go to around this area, please steer clear of this place.  I never return to restaurants that give me the gift of diarrhea, and I suggest you don't risk it.  Don't take any single opinion to heart, but if you read the other RECENT comments and they pretty much say the same thing, you may want to take it as a big hint.\n\nSushi on Summerlin, if I could remove the star I provided on this review today, I certainly would.  You do not deserve it."
0,"I like this store, I just don't like their pricing.  Goodwill prices all their tops the same, jeans the same, etc.  Yesterday I found a pack of disposable plastic Solo plates for $3.  Really?  I'm sure they are cheaper than that at Woodman's.  Last month I passed on some plain while cereal bowls they had priced at $3 each.  Folks at Savers need to go peek at the crowds at Goodwill and find out what Goodwill is doing right.  On a good note, the staff a Savers are very friendly and the store is clean.  Still, I likely will not be going back to Savers."
1,Once a year for the past 10+ years we've been staying here.  You canNOT beat the location.  You can walk to shops and restaurants and the area is safe.  The staff has always been above average.  A few years ago the rooms were rundown but since they have renovated and the rooms couldn't be better.  A hotel doesn't give you that much room - you literally have your our own apartment.  I was there last week because a family member died.  We were having relatives visit us at Shadyside Inn and the staff went out of their way to deliver chairs to our rooms.  Our rooms were cleaned every day and there are very few places that allow dogs - and they do!  Their prices are reasonable and I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in PA.  Thank you Shadyside!
0,"Attempting to eventually have a drink at every bar on Mill led me to try this place. I had a $2 Rolling rock which was on special and there was nobody inside or outside the bar at about 7pm on a weeknight. There was a nice female Hungarian bartender making small talk with me also, but I was assured that the cook was from Texas.\n   If I had just gotten a drink and not tried the food, this review would be better. Most Texas BBQ places cut the meat right in front of you and chopped brisket is not an option. Both of these ideas were shattered as the meat process unfolded in the back of the kitchen and after arriving home noticed it was chopped served with a simple hamburger bun. The brisket was very average and BBQ sauce was on the sweet side, but brisket was cold and needed reheating. Macaroni and Cheese was my side dish choice and it was gummy and had no cheese flavor at all. I had to reheat and dump my own cheese on the thing to salvage that stuff. I only p[aid $7.44 total for the meal, but an empty place, a secret brisket session in the back and horrid side dish should knock this place out of Mill sooner than later. \nTexas BBQ House is the only choice!"
1,"They deliver almost as promised.  I got two hot dogs, a pretzel, and a regular soda for $8 plus tax.  My only issues were that the hot dogs were smaller than expected and there were no refills on the soda.  The hotdogs and pretzel (and mustard) were delicious.\n\nOverall, for the price on the strip it was filling and tasty."
0,"I gave this place a second chance and had the same poor experience as I did the first time, leading me to believe there is a pattern.  \n\nThe service is incredibly slow. There was only a couple of people in front of me and they seemed to be friends of the staff. So the staff decided to chit chat for an exceptionally long time rather than moving them through and helping me with my order. Definitely not happy with that, especially since it happened BOTH times I visited. \n\nNext comes the food and I have to say I was very disappointed. The bread was very dry and stale. Really poor quality that I am surprised they actually served. This also happened BOTH times I visited. I couldn't really get beyond that to comment on any other part of the sandwich.\n\nNeedless to say,  I won't be visiting Jersey Mike's again and putting myself through a needlessly long wait to get stale bread. If I could give them negative stars I would."
0,"No. Just, no. \n\nWe went on a slow day and had no idea what we were in for. Our server was nonexistent for the first 30 minutes, when she finally did show she took another 30 to get our beers. Did I mention the place was 1/4 full? Ridiculous. The coronas were 4 bucks which is crazy when you can walk over to Dos and get them for $2.50. The tables around us were also complaining at the lack of attention. The food here is bland at best. Just don't do it."
0,"was not very pleased with my visit, I was made to wait longer than my Appt time by a half an hour showed up 15 min early for paper work so a total of 45 min,  only to be given a hard time because I didn't have  a not from my Dr because I was pregnant (which I asked if I needed when I made the appt and was told no) I then saw the Dr and was basically told they could do nothing for me I explained I was in a lot of pain and he didn't even give me a script for antibiotics to get rid of the infection from the abscess tooth, all they did was take one x ray and never even gave my mouth an exam. Front lobby was dingy and not well kept the light in the bathroom was out and basically I really feel I was not treated as well as some of the other patients in the office. ( I felt like they catered specifically to the Latin population ) I will be looking for a different Dentists ASAP. I can say one of the girls in the lobby who then also served as my hygienist was very sweet and that is why I gave them 2 starts instead of one. But save yourself time and frustration go else where."
1,"A great little Irish beer with fabulous pub food and awesome drinks!! Quite an extensive selection of whiskeys and import beers alone! I`m usually not a big beer drinker but I did try a dirty black and tan ( half Guinness and half Irish cider), hello delicious!! \nI have been here three times so far to indulge with my friends, group trivia, and its always a great time!! Superb and friendly staff! Plus the gal who reads out the trivia questions has quite a thick Irish brogue, quite enjoyable! Great atmosphere!"
1,"First timers. Everyone is talking about this place. We had to try it.\n\nAbsolutely exceptional customer service. Tina was so accommodating and willing to do what made my sister happy.. She had order the Cubano Panino, not realizing that there's massive mustard in the sandwich. Tina took it back with no hesitation,  gave her another sandwich with no mustard., not only that, she also put sweeet potato fries on the side for her on the house!! \n\nI ordered the Grove, vegetarian of course. It was okay. Not bad not good. The sweet potato is really good :)\n\nI drove far for this.. I would come back :)"
0,"I thought I'd try this place out again since it was pretty good the first time around.  This time I was pretty disappointing.  Last time I went it was after 12 noon.  This time I came in just after 11am.  What a difference an hour makes.  Almost all of the food wasn't hot at all.  Fries, wings and some of the other stuff was cold.  Some of the other was lukewarm.  I'm not an expert by any means but food has to stay at a certain temp to keep from making you sick.  I had my first plate and was very hesitant to go back for more.  I waited until the kitchen guys brought out the fresh hot food before trying anything else.  The place opens at 10am so there's plenty of time to get the warmers going.  If they don't fix it and continue to serve food that temp than someone will get sick."
0,"There's nothing terrible about this restaurant, the food is tasty most entrees were covered heavily in cheese (not my thing) the perfect storm margarita $7.50 or so was quite tasty my pork tacos meat was dry my wife had a stuffed chile relleno (smotherd in cheese) once she removed the glob of cheese the chile was tasty the salsa tasted like picante sauce out of a jar service was good when our waiter brought us our check he had written have a blessed night.........WHAT.........i dont mix religion and drinking.......... to many really good mex restaurants in az to dine at a americanized version.........ps this was the new mesa location"
1,"We went here for our first dinner in Scotland.  I got a Bulmer's cider which is one of my favoroite drinks.  We had to try the haggis fritters and they were delicious!  I feel like it was not really trying haggis because it was deep fried and had a sweet chili sauce.  But I loved the sauce and it was so good.\n\nWe got the fish and chips and shepard's pie to share.  Both were amazing!  The shepards pie was made with lamb which is not my favorite but it worked really well in this.  The fish and chips was one of my favorite on the trip, including all the times we had it in London!  We also got the sticky toffee pudding which came with ice cream.  It was amazing... hot and flavorful and the ic cream totally complimented the sticky toffee.  The waitress was very friendsly and gave honest recommendations.  I highly recommend this place!"
1,"If there's something that I cannot find at any other supercenter, Target usually has it. This store is nice because it's clean, and still yet goes a bit unnoticed by people. It has a Starbucks and a food center, like all usually do. Their clothes section is also pretty great too, although a bit pricey. People are right when they say come to Target for more quality!"
0,"Coming from Toronto, I found this joint much like Guu, but smaller and not as good. \n\nWe waited in line for 1/2 hr - 45 minutes before being seated. Please don't come here in a large group because you will most likely have to split up into groups of 2 or 3. Also, it is very crowded inside. People will be rubbing behind your back to get through.\n\nWe shared the 48 Hours Pork Rice Bowl, Tuna and Salmon Rice Bowl and the Shrimp Burger. \n\nThe 48 hour pork rice bowl is not special. It tastes like any other marinated pork. While it is tender, it's not worth the price.\n\nMy favorite was the tuna and salmon rice bowl. Mix in the crispy ingredients on the top, and you have an extremely fresh bowl of seafood and rice. Very refreshing but not filling.\n\nThe shrimp burger was tasted heavier than the other dishes and was delicious. I wish the shrimp wasn't mashed up, and actual pieces of shrimp were used.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't pay this price or wait this long for Japanese food of this quality. Next!"
0,"Tao nightclub sits on Las Vegas' armpit...You can get lost by wandering the multi-level dance floors and admire the Buddhist inspired yet commercialized art work but after a couple hours you feel like you're inside a whale's stomach and just kinda have to sit and wait until the huge blub throws you up. The pounding music, lights, soup lines forming up and down the stairs will \""get\"" to you. Overdone, overwhelming and a place that leaves the bitter after vodka taste in your mouth"
1,Super good food and it's family owned/operated so the service was great. The perfect combination if you dig supporting small businesses. Do it.
1,"The best Mediterranean food my husband and I ever ate! It was fresh, flavorful and enormous portions! It is a family run operation which makes the restaurant even more charming! The service was great. My husband asked for fries for our 2 year old daughter and the server told us in a very motherly way \""thats not healthy, she'll eat with you, theres rice and chicken\"" (we ordered one of the platters) and she did! I so appreciated that. I was going to tell him that, but she beat me to it. Everything was great from the Hummus, to the lamb kabob, chicken kabob and the gyro meat to the sweet rice and baklava... the baklava is divine!! \n\nCannot wait to be back to see Noreen and taste her moms cooking yet again!"
1,"I had never been here before, but I'm glad I tried it out. It was the best massage that I've ever had."
0,ATTENTION all Brides or anyone else who even considers hiring Adam Brooks from Brooks Photography. HE is an absolute fraud!!!!! Adam will take your money and not deliver what is promised in the contract. He will basically disappear on you and will be impossible to reach. He has been recently pulled from Wedding Wire and and will soon be pulled from other wedding websites. Legal action is taking place from numerous people. Adam Brooks from Brooks photography is also in the process of changing his business name. Maybe things have caught up to him and he needs to start over with a new scam. I will be sure to let EVERYONE know his new name once i get all the details. There is no way we will let him do this to anyone else. Especially brides on a very memorable day for them. Wheres the zero star option?
0,Not a JCPenney customer- but I have been following the news about the total image change for the store. Every Day low prices and really liked the last ad booklet in the sunday paper. Well- upon arriving at the store- there was very limited sizes- not the color selection as advertised- I was planning on a major shoping spree for spring- needless to say- when I finally found a sales associate she suggested that I look at the merchandise in petites or womans sizes? Really?? I am 5'9'' and a size 10. So I left-only bought 2 shirts - JCP definitely need better distribution of merchandise (size and colors) to the stores.. or more saavy buyers! Oh- and when I asked if the merchandise was back ordered- the associate had no idea what that meant!
1,"Unbelievable salon, highly recommended! ! Scotty is the only stylist I've ever been able to completely trust with my hair.  He does an amazing job with both cut and color."
1,Great selection of stores.
0,Litteraly worst nail shop I've ever been too... The first girl put soo much acrylic all over my fingers that when I went to seperate the sides of my nail from my finger it ripped my skin off ... My nails have never stung more wile getting them done ... Than she put the wrong size nail on my middle finger ... Than in 5 days my brand new set a nail broke ....... So I felt like I had to go back so I could get matching polish .... A different lady put the wrong acrylic on my clear nails had to redo that and than questioned me y I wanted the nail polish the way I wanted it as if I wasn't a paying customer ... I will NEVER return here again !
1,"Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.  As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once said \""fully booked\"" when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.\n\nIf you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%."
1,"I'm weirded out by the bad reviews.\n\nI took my kids for lunch.  The dining room is clean and nicely decorated.  The staff was very attentive.\n\nThe value is amazing.  For just over $5  you pick your entree and it comes with lo mein (looks simple but tastes wonderful), fried rice (ok) or white rice and a chicken egg roll.\n\nMy son had the volcano beef.  He really liked it.  My girls shared the honey chicken.  It looked fabulous and they really enjoyed it.  I had the vegetable deluxe.  Likely the best veggies, tofu and sauce I have ever had.\n\nFor dessert we all shared a huge mango smoothie that was less than $2.  Yum!\n\nI look forward to going back.  So happy to have found a restaurant close to home that I like so much!"
0,"I have given this place two shots and I will NOT be giving them anymore chances. I enjoy iPic and really wanted to like Salt as well. Unfortunately they have the worst service EVER! I went for some pre-drinks with my girlfriends (8 of us) and the place was dead. We each ordered a couple of drinks (drinks were mediocre and very overpriced). I still hadn't purchased my movie ticket so I asked for my check a few minutes before my friends were ready to go. The bartender, Zack, asked me with an attitude \""so you want separate checks?\"" I answered yes, so he crinkled up our bill and threw it in the trash with such a rude demeanor! I always assumed that when a group of ladies were ordering alcoholic beverages at a bar that we would want to pay for them separately. We weren't eating at a table, we were sitting at the bar. If that were the case I would've been more understanding. Overall they were extremely slow and rushing around acting like the place was packed even though it was just us. Then the manager said that they just had 400 people come through there in movies so that was the reason they were slow. My thought.. if you are a high end movie theater charging over $20 per ticket you should be well staffed to handle those types of numbers. It's not like they can't predict when the rushes will come. I would think they are well aware of which movies are popular. Maybe they should vary movie times so you are more equip to handle them. We were there to see The Hunger Games a week after it came out so of course it was going to get busy. What did they expect?!? Not to mention the restrooms were a disaster with no soap and toilet paper everywhere. \n\nThe only reason I gave them two stars was because of the food. I've had several different appetizers there and they were all very tasty. At least the chefs know what they are doing in this place!"
0,"Came to Los Reyes de las tortas because of all the good reviews, but I was kind of disappointed. Te place was clean an it was full but they REALLY need more servers service was very slow and the food came one plate at a time. We had the \""del Rey\"" torta because of how famous it is but it OVER RATED! It was bland and super greasy. The queso fundido and the aguas frescas were the BEST thing very good !!! Tacos NOT good at all and the refried beans I won't even go there. But they do serve a LOT of food for the price!"
1,"Amazingly impressed with the customer service here.  I had been to 4 other stores to buy a new pricey appliance and left each time because the sales staff were rude or didn't know about their products.   Stopped by this store and I felt like I was dreaming it was so easy especially compared to the competition.  They not only price matched the other stores lower prices but threw in free shipping.  Staff answered all the questions the other guys couldn't and everything went off without a hitch.   Who knows if the rest of this store is this good as I dont often shop here, but way to go to the appliance folks!"
0,"If you like really dry, overcooked ribs and tips, come to this place. We came with a big group and it was already packed, so we decided to do carryout. It turned out to be 30 mins of waiting in a small cramped restaurant, with people constantly walking by forcing you to move, when our food finally came. There was also a guy walking out telling me, \""not worth the wait.\"" I didn't think too much of it because the place looked promising. We went back to eat it and took about 10 mins figuring out who ordered what. They place all of our food together in 3 bags, which was fine, but they didn't labeled anything. We ordered the combo which included pulled pork, slab of ribs, and rib tips. I only tried the ribs and tips, but they were really dry and the sauce didn't make it any better. I have tried many great ribs, but this one definitely don't cut it. As busy as it gets here, the guy was right, definitely not worth the wait."
0,Lots of food and grease. Enuff said.
1,"Love this little family owned place, great service and good food and value. Support the small guy!"
1,"Pourquoi c'est si bon cet endroit? Est-ce que c'est une attrape touriste? Oui mmaiiss! C'est vraiment bien, avec, manifestemment un inconditionnel amour des produits de l'\u00c9rable, cet endroit nous d\u00e9livre la marchandise avec de tr\u00e8s bonne cr\u00e8me glac\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00c9rable et autre. J'adore les produits de l'\u00e9rable et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 content pour moins de 3-4$ d'avoir un cornet en ce chaud Samedi, revenant d'une expo plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cevante du Centre des Sciences de Montr\u00e9al. Les D\u00e9lices de l'\u00c9rable est effectivement une attrape touriste avec son lot de cossins \u00e0 l'\u00e9rable que chaque touriste se plaie \u00e0 manger et qui co\u00fbte un peu trop cher. Donc ce n'est pas parfait mais tout de m\u00eame un endroit tr\u00e8s bien qui selon ma th\u00e9orie du vieux port de montr\u00e9al, s'est grandement adapt\u00e9 aux locaux: Moins cher qu'avant avec de tr\u00e8s bons choix moins attrape touriste.\n\nI really like D\u00e9lice des \u00c9rables as en Ensemble of great Maple product. I went there Saturday to get a very good maple and mapple butter ice cream cone for less than 3-4$. Pretty decent. Service is quick, the product are amazing and they do offer some non-maple ice cream. They also have great variety of maple sweet and viennoiseries. Pretty good place for the morning coffee and also a little bit of a tourist trap but just enough not to be annoyed by it as a local. Nice place to stop in a hot day as you'll be in the debt Old Port of Montreal without having to venture much far on the outside section of it."
0,"What a ripoff! I got a crab soup togo, it was maybe 8 oz, the cup was not even filled up for $7. And, it was not very tasty, not even close to what I expected. The deli 100 ft down the concourse is priced at $4,  I'll go there from now on."
1,"CAN NOT BELIEVE I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS PLACE UNTIL NOW!! And today it was on a fluke that we were in the area paying bills. Yelp said \""not open til 11am\"" and I AM SO HAPPY YELP WAS WRONG!! I looked across the street to the lit up door sign that said open, next to an open door, next to a sign with specials. Not to mention by 11am (the said opening time) they had at least 6 tables. Glad we got here when we did. \nOff top I could tell this was a mom and pop, mostly regulars type of joint. \nThat does not intimidate me one bit. I more so try to think of, \""how will they remember me if they are lucky enough to have me as a regular?\"" Let me just tell you, I AM THE LUCKY ONE!\nIt was our lovely CM Misti's review talking about \""salads the size of small babies\"" that initially got me here. AND IT'S IN A WOODEN BOWL!?!? yesssssss! \nMy love and I got a Mexican Caesar salad to split. When she brought us EACH out a huge wooden bowl full of salad, I thought there was a mistake. THIS IS ONE SALAD??? (lights shine down from above while music plays)\nI hate it when things say \""spicy\"" and then are not. NOT AN ISSUE HERE!! Spicy lived up to its name. \nWe went with the Italian beef and Italian sausage, with sweet and hot peppers, wet, add cheese. He got fries, I went with the pasta salad as a side. \nHOLY WORDS I CAN NOT SAY ON YELP!!!! \nSeriously we just got this full off $30. One of the owners (or family members) even stopped by our table and said \""wow for first timers I am impressed, are you from Chicago?\""\nWe told him no, we just know good food, and we will be back! He realized last minute we were yelpers and said \""make sure you write something nice!\"" He didn't realize I was already planning and writing my 5 star review since the salad. \nThey also have mexican food on the menu. If I go back and like that too, I might just bring a sleeping bag and refuse to leave."
1,"Had a wedding at The Quad and we stayed there as well.  The renovations are coming along nicely.  Our room was clean and big.  The staff was courteous.  Everyone had a great time.  Our room wasn't as luxurious as some of our family members that stayed at Mandalay Bay or Bellagio, but we didn't pay even half of what they paid.  The location is perfect!"
1,"Absolutely loved it. We came and had a #20 and a salad, so we could try them both. When the salad first came out, it looked small, once I started mixing it, it was quite filling. The bread that the sandwich is made with is so yummy and creative. Love the crust."
0,"I went for their lunch special, but they ran out of soup. They also ran out of eggrolls. They also ran out of curry. It took forty-five minutes for them to make new curry. \n\nThe extra star is for the service. Our waitress was very nice and apologetic about things which she couldn't control. \n\nAfter I ate, I also ran out. I'm not running back in either."
1,This lil neighborhood spot is my new favorite spot for tacos! Have been here several times and have only had the street tacos so far. The carne asada and carnitas are recommended. Service is good. Give them a try for authentic Mexican food!
1,"psssst.... c'mere...... let me let you in on something kinda cool.  Medizona might be the best restaurant you've never heard of.  I mean, really, how is this place not huge?!   I don't have the descriptors to let you know how much I like this place.  \n\nThe food here is creative, attractively presented and fantastic on the palate.  It's southwestern and mediterrenean.  Yeah, \""huh?\""  I know.  I had the same reaction.  It's like Chino Bandido, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't sound like it'd work, but it does.  Go try it for yourself.   Ratatouille quesadilla.  Chorizo potato cake.  Lamb with a moussaka tart with red pepper sauce. And, of course, the prickly pear tiramisu.\n\nGo. \n\nTonight."
0,Paid for extra meat and this is what I get?\nTip 15% and at the door for delivery? \nReally? One and only time I'll order from this place!\nI ordered a chicken BBQ pizza and got a sausage BBQ pizza btw!
0,BBQ chicken was so dry it was almost inedible.  Clearly it had been sitting around warming for some time.  The drinks were so watered down it was impossible to taste the liquor.  I really wanted to like this place but there was nothing to like.  Just plain bad.
1,"Wassup Annie and Regina!\n\nSo about  Mundo... It was good, but not crazy great. I would need to come back to give it a second try. \n\nWell for this try, we had the Queso Flameado which is like cheese fondue served corn tortilla. The cheese combo was really good, along with the other ingredients they put in it. Came with 3 tortillas.  \nThen for entrees we had Carnitas and Seabass. The carnitas was flavorful and sweet, reminded me of coca-cola braised pork. The portion was rather big which was great but again was served with 3 tortillas (note to the restaurant, please give at least 4 tortillas with the apps and entrees) The Seabass was wrapped in parchment and seasoned with spices. Cooked well but not my favorite because I'm not used to the spices. I'm more of a truest with fish - they need to be simply prepared so I can taste the fish.  \n\nFor dessert we had flan and it was really good but I wasn't a fan of the strawberries and fruit syrup with the caramel sauce. \n\nAbout the service, the server was nice but seemed a bit casual compared to the fine dining ambiance. I would have preferred a more professional and informed server. Maybe that's the style of the restaurant but it didn't fit. \n\nAgain, I need to come back and plan to because they have quite a bit of selection of beef entrees that looked good."
1,"What a wonderful evening! Henry, the owner, was very personable and offered to take care of the menu for us. He was constantly sending out food at lightening speed. It was delicious and was a nice wide variety. I especially loved the cabbage, chicken, and eggplant. The service was excellent and the company was stimulating. Typical strip mall atmosphere so that's why only 4 stars."
0,"If I had an option of giving no stars, I would. I called in to make an appointment. They asked me for my insurance card and I asked them to verify to see if the insurance will  pay for the service. This was on friday. On monday I called and they said yes, you are good to go. Few weeks later I get a bill in the mail for $171 to pay for the service. I think that's awful costumer service and I will never go there again and also pass the word to my doctor not to refer anyone there since the doctor asked for my input. Very disappointed........."
0,"I was at an event where they brought in Sprinkles cupcakes. So I can't write about the experience of going into the store. But I do know a good cupcake when I taste one and the one I had was not good. It was a chocolate cake and I think a white frosting with chocolate sprinkles. The cake was very dry. So much so that it was difficult to eat because it crumbled every time I took a bite. Also the frosting left a funny aftertaste in my mouth. I know it's possible that it was just an off batch, but for my cupcake fix I'll continue to support the local Scottsdale Bakery and Cupcake Company for now."
1,"Went for lunch-- oh my.  Talk about a hidden gem!  It's a tiny little place tucked away into the North side-- looks like it was in a house at one point or another.  I'm super disappointed that I didn't get to see/sit on the patio- it was raining on the afternoon that we went.\n\nRegardless, we walked in 5 minutes before they closed in between lunch and dinner (we had no idea, eek!)  But we were seated and served with no complaints.\n\nWe ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls (or Summer Rolls) as an appetizer-- yum!  the sauce was a bit different than what I'm used to; less peanut, more soy and a little more liquidy but still excellent.  The veggies inside were fresh and crispy.\n\nFor my meal, I had the Pad See Ew with chicken... whaaaat!  So simple.  There was nothing extraordinary about this dish except that it was well made with quality ingredients.  YUM.\n\nWhat made me give this place 5 stars is the price that we paid for lunch; my plate was HUGE, delicious, and $7.  Blew.  My.  Mind.\n\nI'll be returning on my next trip to Pittsburgh!"
1,"I like side streets.\n\nI like locals.\n\nI like Monterey Pub.\n\nIf you are hanging out on the North Shore, it's great to take a step back away from the river and take a walk around the Mexican War Streets.\n\nI live here, so I might be a little bit biased, but the row houses and trees make for a pretty good Saturday walk.  There are a few good places to settle down and eat, drink and otherwise be merry...but I really like Monterey Pub.\n\nMonterey is a legit Irish pub.  They've got Irish Beef Boxty, Salmon Boxty, Sheheard's Pie, broiled fish.  If you aren't feeling adventurous, Monterey Pub knocks their hamburgers out of the park.\n\nThey are good.  Real good. The Monterey Patty Melt? Yes, please.\n\nMonterey Pub isn't really a place to party, thankfully.  It's a neighborhood bar with good food and great people.  It's a place to pull up a stool, fill up a frosty glass and get down to talking with your friends.\n\nI think we all need a few more places like this to get away, put down our phones, forget about our work and grow closer to our friends.\n\nMonterey -- sure.  Let's go."
0,I went to nail envy today and was there roughly around an hour thinking I was gonna have a gel mani like I normally do. But this time I was going to take off the old ones and put on new.\nAll the nail techs were busy so she asked one of the pedi ladies if she was comfortable doing it to soak and then take them off and I heard her say it at least two times and she said yes took me to a chair and used a metal knife looking thing and a nail to try and take them off: well she ended up splitting one and putting a hole in another. Only after she split the one did she have an attitude about the situation and threw her hands up in the air and said fine I'll soak them. I sat there and waited for the next lady to come. I whispered what happened to her so I didn't disturbed the people around me having their nails done\nShe recommended that I not do the gel and give it a rest. I paid and then waited for my ride. I told the front desk lady bc she asked why I didn't do the mani and she told me that I should still do it. I give this place 2 stars because after the fact my bf and I called back and was upset. Left our number bc the owner lives in Cali. He was nice enough to try and accommodate me but I ask myself this question. Why go back when this happened?? My faith in them has diminished. I'll place a few photos to show what I mean. Look for my name
0,They do not have any of the special 2 or 3 course menus. Not worth the drive to this location. I would go to Sahara and Decatur or inside the suncoast. Def will not be coming back to this location. Don't want anyone else to waste there time coming here. Hope this helps
0,"HORRIBLE!! i would like to give this place 0 stars! went in and ordered 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and a chicken parm sandwich...they told us it would be 25 mins! we paid and sat there for over 45 MINUTES!! this unorganized crappy service pizza joint is garbage...the delivery driver made 2 deliveries while we were sitting there waiting on 2 slices and a sandwich CMON really...so i thought maybe the food was worth the wait. NOPE the pizza tasted kinda rubbery and the chicken parm wasnt even chicken parm, it was some chicken thigh pieces that were coated w a grip of cheese and sauce-no breading...and the bread was sogggggyyyyy...worst ever! im not a big review person but i gotta warn people. only went here bc someone wrote a good review- they were sooo lying...dont waste your time or money!!!"
0,"Not good. Enchiladas weren't even heated, tostada shell was stale, soda was flat.\n\nWe won't bother going back."
0,"Hmm the fact that you think it's ok or really didn't acknowledge that your staff asked us to stay another night in order to receive a bath is beyond my eyes!!! I do believe that dogs do suffer the amount of attention they get from your staff with the amount of dog and cat runs. It took my dogs a week to calm down and relax. I'm not looking for a place that has couches and tvs for my dogs, I mean really come on???? And when the guy brought out my dogs and I said oh are they coughing....maybe your employee should have said if anything becomes wrong with your dogs please bring them back and we'll look at them for free....just sayin if you wanted to offer that above and beyond customer service."
1,"went with a group of 10 on thursday night  and the cast of glee showed up! fun times :)\n\nthe organizer for the evening forgot to make reservations  - we were having dinner across the street and i frantically ran over to see about securing a table for 10 about an hour before we were planning to arrive.  they were able to accommodate us at the couches around the corner by the door where you can't see the performance. (luckily we were able to score - ahem, steal -  a table next to the stage eventually) \n\nmoral of the story - when going with a group, make reservations."
1,"On my list of Dive Bars to visit when in Las Vegas . . . and so we stopped for a quick one before heading back to our hotel.  Best part . . . I drank for free . . . because I was playing video poker.\n\nNot a bad set-up . . . but will all the glass doors . . . you get a feeling that it is kind or small.  Though we did not eat any thing, the food smelled wonderful.\n\nI will most likely be back on another trip to try this place for lunch . . . only because when I am in Las Vegas . . . I like to dinner out at nicer restaurants . . . and this place has more of that homey atmosphere."
1,Amazing club/bar!!! Live music every night! Great staff! I have been coming for years and it is always a good time!
1,I have been coming here ever since I moved to this side of town. if you are looking for fresh bread and pastries and amazing desserts go no further. The bread reminds me of the bread you would get in Europe fresh and fluffy not like the Wonder Bread that sticks in your mouth.if you are looking for a coffee cake or wonderful desserts to take to any get together this is the place to come. They have really neat looking desserts that taste just as good. it has a great selection of Polish food but also other European delights. The only downside to this place are the hours--not open after work. I have not eaten in the deli yet but I've heard from other neighbors that it's really good too.
0,"omg gotta say the WORSE pho ever, me my fiance were in the  area and feel like some pho, heard this place was great from a few people and friends, decided give it a try... when we get there there were no one to bring us to our table or even greet us, we end up seating our self .there was only one or two other table eating at the time,  takes the owner/waiter  awhile  to bring us the menu and water, we both order pho dac biet , the broth was so plain and barely any meat in it , i cook pho at home every now and then but i can guarantee it taste ten time better,i also ask for some white onion  it never came out , i went up and remind him again, it still didn't came out, we didn't even finish our pho and decided to pay and leave,when we went up to pay the owner looks nervous and shaky i notice this lady with a clapboard looks like a health sanitary inspector writing something looking around the kitchen  . no wonder he wasn't all there with the customer maybe the kitchen is gross or unsanitary that's why he worrying, makes me scare what is going on with the pho if we'll get a stomach ache after eating there."
1,"Yes, it is weird to get a plate of meatballs and gravy with  lingonberries and mashed potatoes in a furniture store. But if it's wrong I don't want to be right! Tasty and super cheap you could draw some comparisons to all the other bits of merchandise carried by IKEA, but I'll let you be the judge.\n\nOnly once was I awake early enough to get their breakfast, and it was pretty good and only 99 cents!\n\nOther highlights: apple cake :) the hot dogs and cinnamon buns aren't too bad downstairs, either."
0,"If you like more bread than meat in your sandwhich than maybe you'll like JJ's.  The sandwhich had big fat bread, but one super thin slice of meat, cheese so thin i couldn't find it or taste it.  The tomato slice was thick, too bad I asked for no tomato and got it anyway.  Black pepper was not available as an ingrediant nor are pickles.  Only a side pickle.  The sandwhich is small and  not worth the money.  \n\nIf you want a good sandwhich,  go to Port o Subs where they slice and pile all the meat you want and paper thin sliced pickles are yummy."
0,"It's a below average, overpriced Chinese buffet.  Crab legs were overdone, stir-fry dishes all had a strange taste. They had a large selection of seafoods, but not the best quality (I know, I know--it IS an oriental buffet--what should I expect?). Two buffets and 1 soft drink...total $27.86...ouch!"
1,"That's a spicy meatball! Or in Gadzooks' case an enchilada. They do enchiladas and they do them very well. There are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada. Tons of different meats, sauces, and veggies to choose from. You could really try a new flavor combination every time you go in. The atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time. They also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your meal very well. The staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and I when we told them this was our first visit. The cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type. \n\nI really enjoyed this place and I am looking forward to trying more of their food in the future."
0,My wife got food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.....
0,"First off, I'm not one of those two star reviewers. You know the kind: \""It cost so much!\"" \""I don't get the food, I like hamburgers.\"" \""This place is too fancy, so here's your one star.\"" That's not me. I am a foodie. Check my other reviews for proof. So, given this disclaimer here's my two cents on L'Atlier...\n\nOne word: \nHalf-assed.\n\nPre-game:\nOur group of nine ate here this last weekend. I made reservations in advance. They required a $75 reservation fee (non-refundable and not applied to the meal) . That's a first. And because we were a large group we were limited to tasting menus only. Fine. Ain't no thing - this place is #2 on Yelp. I'm excited! I love food!\n\nThe experience:\nWe were smashed into the wall. There was not enough room to get into our seats. Once the table was moved so all the ladies, in their lovely dresses, could shimmy in, they were trapped - the whole meal - full bladders and all. The service sucked. They already had their guaranteed 20% gratuity (because of our party size). So, we endured a meal full of empty glasses, missing silverware, and a wonky table.\n\nThe Food:\nAverage. We had two vegetarians with us (the restaurant knew about this ahead of time) and when the amuse arrived they were served foie gras mouse. You can't take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter? Two of the courses (in a row) had the same pesto sauce. Not a big deal, but the primary components were so bland all you could taste was pesto. \""Sir, for your fist and second courses this evening you will be having pesto.\"" Come-on! Most of the dishes were one note. In general the meal was uninspired. \n\nIn summary:\nWe left disappointed. Michelin should revoke their one star. I know it's harsh, but it's truth. Do you hear me, Bibendum?"
0,"I stayed here to view the timeshare package. They were rude and wouldn't let me view by myself. I wanted to tour but the sales staff wouldn't allow it and threaten to charge me. The security attempted to try to take me out and Andy the sales manager stated that he would call the police. I debated their policy regarding that \""couples\"" had to view the timeshare being that I can purchase on my own.  Never staying here again."
0,"Messy place located in a semi-basement establishment. Waited for 15 minutes BEFORE their closing time until someone came to us and told us that they're closing.\n\nI don't know, a simple closing sign or telling us a little earlier would've sufficed."
1,"All five stars go to Yancy!!\n\nI've had laser before, several years ago and was thrilled. I remembered how painless it was and the terrific results even after just one treatment (I am terrible at follow up appts, arg!).\n\nFast forward to now, I purchased a Living Social deal for 6 treatments at Laser For Less.  It's extremely close to my work, and they're super friendly and accommodating of my schedule.  I opted for my highly sensitive underarms, as the ingrown hairs just would not go away.\n\nMy first 3 underarm treatments were with another person at this location, but it was painful and a bit torturous.  I had to switch my 4th appt to a different day and was pleasantly surprised to see that I had a new laser tech for my treatment: Yancy.\n\nShe sets up the room and table so that I'm most comfortable.  Her technique is perfection - the treatments are painless and quick.\n\nYancy is the way to go for laser hair removal.  She understands the reaction of the hair follicle and the skin, and does all she can to combat any discomfort.  I have been dazzled and impressed by her skills, and rendered virtually hairless!\n\nLaser 4 Less, specifically Yancy, are top notch and I would proudly recommend them to any friend."
1,The best me and my wife have had in Vegas. The trick here is order the full order and tell them how you want it. We had the pork fried rice extra dark lots of soy and hot \nwe had the Chow Mein hot and well done and the orange flavored chicken extra crispy and you guessed it HOT! The services is always great the staff is so friendly and the place is clean I can not ask for more
1,"= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR G'S BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nG's here has a daily HOT DOG BUFFET, & is it ever good!  All sorts of different kinds of hot dogs available, plus big selections of condiments, other hot foods & many side dishes.  I enjoyed a big Smoked Polish Dog, an Italian Sausage Dog, potato salad, cole slaw, mixed fruit, mixed steamed veggies, tasty onion rings, BBQ Chicken & more.\n\nHot Dog Buffet Monday through Thursday:  $8.95 including fountain beverage.\n\n*  For $10.95 they will make you a big sandwich too (but why?).\n\n*  For $14.95 on Friday & Saturday they put out more food items, soups, crab legs, shrimp, & prime rib as well as the hot dogs.\n\nIt's a big YAY! & a high 4 Stars for G's Hot Dog Buffet!     :-))"
0,"What a poor experience I had at the BK location.  I admit that I am not the biggest supporter of the King.  I am more of a McD's guy myself.  But when BK has something that catches my eye like a special sale or a new item, I check it out.  This is what happened the other day.  They were offering the Original Chicken Sandwich for just $1.04.  The price was right but the food was all wrong.  The chicken was over cooked and taste burnt.  It had become chewy after sitting under the heat lamps for a while.  The lettuce was barely there and very wilted.  The mayo was and the verge of being bad.  I had to add pickle relish to the sandwich to make it edible.  And my disapointment does not end there.  I also ordered the new sweet potato fries.  Horrible.  I only ate them becauase they cost $1.89 and I am not in the habit of throwing that down the drain.  The fries were over cooked, soggy, and chewey and rather tastless.  Just sort of starchy.  They could have used a little salt which, coming from me, says a lot.  I rarely require salt on anything.  I have been to this BK location before and I'll likely come back again based on nothing more than convenience.  It is close and sometimes a Whopper or a double cheese burger sounds good.  It is far from being my first choice."
1,Jaymee was a great waitress she was positive and upbeat the whole time! I will be coming back to the bar section just to be helped by her.
0,"I knew I was in trouble when I ordered online and there was a box to add a tip for food to go.  I worked for tips for 20 years and know you work for them.  Ordering food online and picking it up never gets a tip from me.  Like a tip jar on the counter of Dunkin Donuts.  For why?    Pass on this place.  I asked for extra green onions in my Mongolian Beef. Didn't see it. However, beef was very tender, but not impressed.  Next dish was Moo Goo Gai Pan to which the sauce is the secret.  The vegetables were ok, chicken was overcooked according to person eating it.  Again, sauce too mild."
0,"I would like to preface this extremely negative review by saying that my husband and friends and I are easygoing, polite, and positive people who try not to be difficult, rude or demanding when in a restaurant or bar.  With that said, we will NEVER go to Tin Roof in Charlotte again because of exceptionally bad service (and an overall bad vibe).  \n\nThe drink menu is written on a piece of looseleaf paper carried by just one of the servers, which we initially thought was hilarious.  We were less amused when our group's drink orders came out late and incorrect, and even less amused when it took over 20 minutes to correct the mistake.  Our food orders were equally late and incorrect, and our server was confused, erratic, and difficult to track down.  The bill, as expected, was a jumbled, inaccurate mess and we needed to track down three different managers over the course of an hour to resolve the problem.\n\nSome of the food was delicious, but several orders contained undercooked meat and many were just wrong.  \n\nIf a single person on staff had apologized or mentioned that they were struggling to get set up after their recent opening, we would have had absolutely no problem with the evening and empathized with the overwhelmed servers.  Instead, the staff made excuses (\""Well, it's not usually this busy\"") and not a single staff member apologized that we had to wait for hours for incorrect orders.  \n\nAgain, we realize that this is not the apocalypse and that there are much more serious problems in the world than being double-charged for an undercooked meal, but with so many awesome restaurants to choose from in Charlotte, I doubt we would ever find the need to visit Tin Roof again."
1,"If you have not experienced Abuelo's I highly recommend you give it a try.    In my opinion the food is excellent.     The shrimp chowder is to die for.    Their prime rib on Thursday's is the best.     Their traditional mexican food is good.     I  tend to like all their other  fish, beef & pork menu items.      You cannot go wrong by trying this establishment."
1,"A delightful bakery.  This place is bustling with activity and there are dozens of varieties of breads and pastries to choose from.  The line moves fast, and you feel kind of spoiled for choice with so many tempting things they offer.\n\nWe ordered a baguette parisienne, almond croissant, and apple dumpling (sort of an apple pastry).  The baguette was nice and soft on the inside, crusty on the outside.  The croissant was delicate and had just the right amount of almond filling - just terrific with a coffee.  We consumed the apple pastry a couple days later and it was probably past due, so I cannot fairly pass judgement on it.\n\nThe lady at the counter did not speak English but got our order just fine when we used our broken French.  She took extra time to nicely wrap up the apple pastry in a tiny box.  I'd definitely visit here again the next time I am in town."
0,"I think we might have had way too high of expectations for this place. I liked how nothing had nasty mayo all in it, but the selection was very minimal and they didn't give me an option for my side so I was stuck with potato chips. The lady was super friendly and the food was okay, but nothing more than I would expect to pick up at the grocery cafe store on my lunch break. Probably won't be back here even though the prices are good. But I'd honestly be happier with Subway."
0,"We waited for about an hour for brunch which is a tad too long. The server seemed very rushed and very short with us when she greeted us. When we asked for water she only brought one glass and I had to wave her down to get a second. The food was not very good. It seemed fake, like it had a bunch of fillers. I would best describe it as the IKEA of breakfast food. It was also very bland. The worst part was that both of plates consisted of about 80% hashbrowns. I'm not sure why people love this place so much. We will not be back."
1,"First I will tell the good , most important, the burgers were awesome! Lots of choices. The bad, the staff, sorry. They were not awful but seemed so scattered. We didn't see our server much but saw a lot of other staff. 3 different people brought out our food. Also we had the living social deal that was 2 burgers 2 sides and 2 drinks. My friend never got his side and was too polite to say something so we all shared. Also people around us were complaining they didn't get their order right. We would go back but only if in the area, (we live in Gilbert) if we would have payed full price we would have made sure everyone got all their food. Would be 5 stars if they work out the staff stuff."
1,"The Gold's Gym in Fitchburg served me well for a good two years. I was sad to leave it when I moved to Baltimore. \n\nThis location was newly built within the past 5 years. The equipment still seems pretty new. There's a pool, sauna, cinema room, and day care in additional the weights and cardio rooms and equipment. The basketball court is kind of small, but they just renovated it to have hardwood floors. At least they have one. Not all gyms in the area do.\n\nThere's always promotions going on, and depending on when you sign up you could be in for a good deal. I remember when I first signed up, I got two months free. Then the next year, they ran a deal where if you get people to sign up under you, they add $20 to the total cost and split it among those people. For example, if I was paying $40 and I get two people to sign up under me, everyone gets to pay $26.67."
0,"Knowing this was a casual cheap diner, we didn't expect 5 stars.  BUT ... there's a certain level of service all establishments should meet and unfortunately this place missed the mark.\n\nWe arrived at 10 pm on a Saturday.  While our server was sweet, the service was horrible and our food was cold which didn't make sense because there was hardly anyone in there.  She forgot the ranch for our fried pickles, refills on water, silverware, and the check.  We will not be back and suggest hitting up the Denny's across the street."
0,"Bring your own tape and scissors.  I wasn't allowed to use theirs because of \""insurances\"", and they charged me $2 to tape my package.  Business must be slow.  FEDEX next time."
0,"Unfortunately, I wish I could not give any stars. I go to the Circle K on Miller & Camelback. Place looks fairly clean, but TERRIBLE customer service, the employees are always frowning and never look happy. They also have a habit of not welcoming you in the doorway nor do they say \""Have a nice day.\"" I have never seen them out on the floor doing anything, they just sit behind the counter moping and looking miserable. There is also a girl there who took my ID and would NOT stop asking how old I was! I was so irritated by her ignorance. Unfortunately it's the closest Circle K I can go to get things considering I have no vehicle. Seriously, get some new employees! I hate going there!!"
0,"Another Mexican place that makes Americanized Mexican food that reliance a on lots of cheese and salsa.  Nearly everything looks and tastes the same.  If you want American Mexican, flowing chips and salsa and sweet margaritas, there is always a crowd."
0,Worst barbershop I've ever experience DON'T GET YOUR HAIR CUT HERE. I went there on a Friday and business was terrible the barbers are untrained and this is truly a mom and pops shop I don't see how they've accomplished getting a barber's license the lady didn't even know how to edge a hairline worst place inexperienced and untrained service is exactly what I received don't be the next.
1,"Absolutely wonderful!!! I planned my boyfriend's surprise 30th in Vegas with about 10 of our closest friends! The staff at Las vegas Custom Cakes were incredible. They talked me through all of the steps and completely eased the anxiety of ordering/booking a trip from Boston to Vegas. The cake was a huge hit and exactly how I pictured! And it wasn't just beautiful to look at, the taste was delicious. I'd recommend Las Vegas Custom Cakes to anyone!"
0,"I haven't been to Forum in a long time and it was not what I remembered. I went last night (Friday night) and it was dead. The crowd was very slim and somewhat diverse. I noticed that most people seemed to be very casual looking. It kind of reminded me of the people at club 2000 a long, long time ago. Unlike Emily's review, I didn't see too many people that looked older than their twenties. \n\nThe drinks were good, but a little pricey. My friend pointed out that they had just jacked up the price of her usual. The music was typical club techno in the main part and the Latin music was alright, but that DJ upstairs was driving me crazy screaming about Detroit all night. \n\nIt wasn't the worst experience I've ever had at a club, but in my opinion there are far better places to go."
0,"Let's see where to begin, the menu states that all burgers are cooked to medium and had ordered it that way but it came out well over done! Also the chicken sandwich which is way over priced($9) for just two fried chicken strips on sandwich, come on you can get way better chicken sandwich at chick fil a for half that price! Plus to add on to it the chef/ kitchen staff doesnt know how to run a kitchen and an owner that doesnt know how to run a restaurant.... Over all will never return!!!"
1,Ah-mazing! My only complaint is that my boyfriend and I were running late to see a show so we had to rush though dinner a bit. The food was absolutely wonderful. We ordered both of the bento boxes which really is a little bit of everything off the menu so I would recommend doing that. The green curry with shrimp was one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted.  After we finished the shrimp I was eating the sauce like a soup.  Sooo good. The dim sum was particularly good as well.  As I mentioned before we were in a rush so we didn't order dessert but if their dessert is anything like their dinner I'm sure you are in for a treat. Highly recommended!
1,"You gotta love when trends come back in. I remember the 90's frozen yogurt craze. Hell they even devoted a Seinfeld episode to it! \n\nI see tons of froyo and cupcake places popping up. Most of them are just trying to catch the streak du jour. Yogurtland seems to have it down to a science. You need four things to be the froyo king.\n\n1. Location. (215 & Eastern) not gonna be much more convenient than that.\n\n2. Cost (.30 cents an ounce) might as well be free!\n\n3. Variety (between the dozens of flavors they rotate and the hundreds of toppings, you can't get bored)\n\n4. Volume (you don't want any of number 3 above to sit for long) \n\nThis location has them all covered. Great outside seating for a bonus! We have had some challenges among friends to see who can get and eat the largest concoction. ($8 and change is the current leader) \n\nHappy yogurting to you!"
0,"The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet."
1,This place is awesome. It's large so the wait on the weekend isn't bad. Menu is diverse and the food is delicious. Totally recommend the Baja omlette.
0,"The Bellagio was sadly a bit disappointing. I was in town for a trade show event in July and found the hotel overcrowded and nearly impossible to navigate during the day. A \""quick\"" bite to eat took nearly 1.5 hours at a 2 p.m. lunch. Service was slow and lacking all over the resort.\n\nWhen I checked into my room, there was a massive clump of hair in the bathroom sink. Disgusting. I've staying in all kinds of hotels all over the world from two to five stars and have to say I've never seen a dirtier bathroom.\n\nWe had an unfortunate incident where a colleague had to have emergency surgery while on our trip. A horrible incident anywhere, but especially when one has to spend hours in a Las Vegas ER. When I called the hotel desk in the morning to ask for a late checkout so we could visit our friend in the hospital and get her returned to her hotel. We needed to make sure she was comfortable and all arrangement were made for her family to arrive before we caught a flight out of the city that afternoon. I was informed that it would only be possible if we paid a 1/2 day rate of $70+ dollars. How unfortunate that a hotel of this supposed caliber can't accommodate a guest in their city with this type of request. Especially since our flight schedules meant that we would be on our way to the airport by 3 p.m. at the latest.\n \nThe casino staff was lovely and the hotel was ok but certainly not deserving of a AAA five diamond. When I return to Vegas, I think I'll be staying at the Wynn. \n\nSorry, Bellagio, I had higher hopes."
1,Food was terrific!  Service was fabulous.  Went for the first time and Ill definitely be coming back!
1,"Great, great club!\n\nIt is especially even more great when you get bottle service and a place to sit down and even your own small area to dance b/c... \n\nTHIS PLACE GETS PIZZZZZZ-ACKKKED!  And I mean, shoulder to shoulder with random people you do not know... \n\nBut if you are willing to brave the huge crowds, it's a great place to have lots of fun!  The crowds are consistently above average, there is good music playing all throughout... and it's one of the bigger Vegas clubs ... which means more area to roam (or more realistically, push and shove your way through) around..."
1,"I've just been forced to concede that, despite still not digging their ordering process, their food is just too good to disrespect with a 2 star review."
1,"I have been back several times since my first (less that stellar) experience and am glad I did. I have had their \""Number 1\"" sandwich, which is wonderful. I enjoy their \""new recipe\"" lasagna VERY much. And I have tried their pizza which is also very good. I'm really glad that I gave this place another try. The shift managers Lori Beth and Kelly are SO nice!! I guess this just goes to show that any place can have an off night. I'll be back again!!!"
0,This is the 3rd time I've been here and I have to say the service is so slow and indifferent. They used to be the only pho place south of Charlotte but thank goodness for the new Viet/Thai restaurant just past Matthews in Indiantrail on hwy 74 food is fresh and the service is much better. Never coming back here again!
0,"Rude!!\n\nI walked in and was ready and willing to make this my new tanning salon because there was no wait and it wasn't crowded like my usual spot is right after work. The guy at the front desk looked extremely uninterested and acted as if I was bothering him with my questions. Because it was my first time there I explained to him that I was looking to try this place out and wanted to know what kind of packages they offered, he pointed to a piece of paper taped to the counter and that was it (no help, no salesmanship). I asked if they had a copy of the paper for me to take home and look over, again he was rude and acted like I was inconveniencing him. He said he could print one out if I wanted, I told him I would like that and would get it after my session so he would have plenty of time to do that. After I laid in the mediocre bed for 15 minutes I walked out expecting to have the print out of package options. No such luck, the guy was on what seemed to be a personal phone call so I waited around the counter for about 2 minutes while I was completely ignored and finally walked out. \n\nI see now why there was not wait right after work."
1,"Beautiful hotel and a great place to stay when you travel to Vegas.  I've been to many Vegas hotels, and I think this is best one I've stayed in so far.  This is the boutique hotel experience on the Vegas strip.  If you want luxury hotel, then go to Encore or Wynn; if you want themed go to Bellagio, Caesars, or Venetian, but if you want a relaxed, classy, boutique experience, then this is the place for you.  I think this does the W hotel experience perfectly, and it's centrally located on the Vegas Strip.     \nI stayed there with my wife for 4 nights.  The prices are very reasonable.  They charge you a resort fee of $15 for use of their facilities and internet.  When we stayed at Aria just next door, they charged $35 for use of hotel amenities and another $15 for internet use daily.  I like that Vdara doesn't try to shake you down for every little dime like most Vegas hotels.  The lobby is understated and quiet.  You don't have to walk through a smoky loud casino to get to the elevators.  The pool is small but very nice and well serviced.  None of the rowdiness or riff raff that you get often in other places.  I really enjoyed staying here and found everything pretty faultless."
1,"Located in a small, but warmly-staffed food court near the CSN Campus, Kaba Curry takes convenience, charm, and really great cooking, and wraps it all up neatly in an affordable, fun, and genuine eating experience. CSN students are very lucky to have this near campus...\n\nThere are tons of provided curry options, a few non-curry options, with lots space to customize as well; it's always great when you can count on a menu and add-ons to satisfy almost any taste and profile. You can do a very traditional curry with just sauce and potato, but you can go all the way up to having spam and/or shrimp gyoza on your curry. The serving sizes are generous for the price, and can be shared if you and your partner are not particularly hungry, but not excessive. The dishes are cohesive, mildly sweet, and satisfying, like Japanese-style curry sauces and dishes should be. The green tea desserts are made with great matcha. Bullet-proof deliciousness there. Definitely trying the chantilly dessert next time.\n\nI love the attention to detail the staff has as well, providing extra spoons when they know you'll be sharing, and remembering people from past visits. That extra touch goes a long way - as a result, it seems that Kaba Curry has quite the loyal following, and for good reason! Looking forward to returning here again, and seeing them keeping it up like this. It's not a complicated joint, but it doesn't pretend to be, either, and Kaba Curry is fantastic at what they do and should do."
0,"I am usually pretty generous on my reviews, but considering I have been to this place a few times I simply find my overall experience average at best. It is undeniable that they have pretty good pizza and decent wings, but the customer service that I have always experienced here is just okay. I am not very demanding when it comes to customer service like some, but a smile here and there and appreciation for customers would be nice. Customer service goes a long way in my book, and I have found a couple other pizza joints that offer great customer service that I would rather frequent. \n\nWe arrived with a restaurant.com coupon that was purchased just a few days prior only to find that they weren't accepting them anymore. Hmmm, that wasn't very settling considering I bought a few of them. My question was, \""Why are they available for purchase if you are no longer accepting them?\"" Only to be told, \""Well, they shouldn't be on there anymore and they will probably be taking them off soon.\"" \n\nMeh... I think I can find better customer service with a smile at Grande Pizza just down the road where they make an effort to remember my name and greet with a warm smile."
1,"Design your own burrito! In a modest, slightly dingy strip mall sits Sombrero's, a small little eatery serving slow cooked, marinated meats, with your choice of various fillings and tortillas.\n\nI stepped in today to try a tasty burrito. You have your choice of meats such as barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and chicken. Tortilla choices include tomato basil, chipotle, spinach, wheat, and regular flour. They offer fillings such as pinto beans, black beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and salsa. Freshly made guacamole and jalapeno cream cheese can be added for an extra charge. \n\nI opted for the barbacoa, with tomato basil tortilla, pinto beans, rice, onions, cheese, guacamole, and spicy salsa. The meat was tender and flavorful. The accompanying ingredients meshed well with the barbacoa. The spicy salsa is indeed quite hot, and packs a punch!\n\nI also tried some horchata ($1.99), which was refreshing and creamy.\n\nService was friendly and cheerful. My burrito was made quickly, and check out at the cashier was easy.\n\nSombrero's is definitely a good place for a filling meal!"
0,"Not sure how this is the first one star review of this place... but here goes.\n\nDriving home today, I wanted something QSRish, but without a drive thru since my three year old would have insisted on getting french fries. Since Wednesday is not Fry-day, except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free, I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.\n\nSo, I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place, but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.\n\nFirst off, this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place, so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because, how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.\n\nThe egg roll was among, if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.\n\nThen came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was, it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.\n\nSeriously, if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian, skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay versus getting food at Asian 1."
0,Very cute locale and pleasant waitresses.   Food was mediocre.
1,"I had another butter burger with cheddar and you know what, its pretty good. They are certainly better than that shit known as In n Out. The fries are actually very good as well. I am a fan."
1,"This is a great place to watch any game, ridiculous number of TVs all over the walls. The food is very good too. Nice place to play darts if you're into that.\nI really don't go here often enough.\n\nBe warned it is a very busy and noisy place. Not good for kids. Otherwise, highly recommended"
1,"The beer selecion alone is enough for me to come back, but they also have fried pickles and a fried pickle never hurt anyone."
0,"I'll give this review a little more attention than the wait staff gave us. Food mediocre. Hot sausage sandwich ok, meatball sandwich was cold. Wait staff didn't care at all. Also, we were the only people in the restaurant. If you value service and good food look elsewhere."
0,"This place used to be much better.  This is my third time.\n\nMany of the items did not impress me.  Sushi selection is dismal, one item?  Come on!  They need to take down the sign claiming to be the #1 buffet in Vegas!  They are not even close!\n\nI did enjoy the prime rib and potatoes.  The crab legs were average.  The Middle eastern food was good as well.  I enjoyed the Humus, tabouleh, lamb.  The chicken was a bit dry so get some sauce for it.  Soup selection was poor.  We tried a number of desserts and most were OK.  I liked the souffle.  I doubt I will return.  \n\nToo many better places in Vegas for a buffet!  I'd be willing to pay more for a better experience."
1,"Used to love coming here when I lived in Pittsburgh - great food, nice environment - paella, garlic shrimp - all of the spanish classics were great.  Haven't been here in some time - hope it is still as good as I remember.\n\nWas a huge fan of the South Side in general - great festivals, bars, restaurants, german/polish restaurants, fun one-off shops, bakeries, great place to walk around, etc...\n\nLast time I was back , it seemed to be a tale of two worlds on the South Side - some of the one-off local business looked like they were gone or suffering, and there was new development with retail chains that probably brought some new investment, but was a different character.  Was fairly early on a Saturday morning, so perhaps I did not see things as they typically are here - nonetheless , memories of a very good restaurant and the South Side/Carson Street."
1,"Been reviewed a jillion times. Nothing to add, except that the Ass Juice is nasty.. I like to pick up people at the airport, and take them straight to the DD, just for shock value. Last time I did that was with my boy Tommy, who was suitably impressed."
0,"They got my order wrong. I told three people, the strawberry shortcake NOT the chocolate strawberry. I pointed at it, told them explicitly not the chocolate and at the register she said chocolate and I said, \""no I told two people not the chocolate!\"" Charged me for the vanilla I wanted, I opened the box and what do you know, it was chocolate.\n\nMind you, the vanilla/strawberry thing was the only thing not labeled and I assumed it was strawberry shortcake but apparently wasn't exactly what it was called and that's what got everybody confused and it turns out it was what it's called but I'm not the one who didn't label it.\n\nSo they got my order wrong, and the Oreo and the chocolate/strawberry tower I got wasn't even that good. The vanilla cupcake wasn't any better. The buttercream tasted like buttercream from albertsons cupcakes.\n\nAnd mind you, this isn't a bad review just because they got my order wrong and I'm salty about it. I was hoping the cake and pastries would make up for it and they sadly didn't. You pay for the name and that's it. \n\nSprinkles has WAY better cupcakes. Which is where I went after to soothe my pain of a terrible cupcake I spent 6 dollars on, I got a 1000% better one for half the price."
1,"Popped into World Market on a Saturday (7/27) around 1 pm and was greeted at the door by a sales associate, who offered me a cart and informed me that I was just in time for the Wine tasting.  What luck!  I had the opportunity to taste a Riesling, Wine Spritzer and a Malbec.  All delectable; decisions, decisions!  I bought the Wine Spritzer, which was made with white wine and pomegranate juice, and was a steal.  I moved on to the food section, where I picked up items I don't normally find in the grocery store.\n\nThe store is jammed with all kinds of goodies, but is well organized, and there is plenty of staff on hand to assist.\n\nI proceeded to the checkout, where the service was fast and friendly.  Swiped my Explorer card and got an additional discount!  I love this place!"
0,"I have been a subscription customer of westfield comics since the late 80s, with a couple of hiatus(es) while in graduate school or moving around the country. Sadly, I am canceling my standing orders due to poor customer service and failure to answer my questions via email. Its a serious decision because now I'll either have to figure out which of the dwindling number of comic stores in my area will pull titles, or find another company online. I am giving them 2 stars because up until now, I had a great experience. Kind of feels like a betrayal after approximately 25 years, but I'm a big boy with a nice income to spend with a better company with better customer service."
0,"The staff seem friendly enough but I think there are some weird policies going on with new game releases. I went in looking for a copy of Halo 4. The employee behind the counter said that there were no copies available because everything was preordered already and it would have to be mail ordered. He added that Wal Mart and Best Buy were all sold and the best chance to get them game would be to order it with gamestop and wait a week for it to be shipped. A quarter mile stroll to the Wal Mart in the same shopping center revealed that not only was Wal Mart not sold out, but they had plenty of copies available. I'm really disappointed that the employees would lie so readily just to get a sale of a game that, based on the hundreds of \""preordered\"" copies sitting behind the counter they had already done quite well selling. Dishonesty does not breed loyalty in customers. \n\nBoo."
1,The white chocolate macadamia ice cream is to die for. I also like how they have board games while waiting for your purchase.
1,"Enjoy popcorn? Think it's okay but not something you can see yourself eating until you get sick to your stomach? Well get ready to have your world turned upside down!\n\nThe Pittsburgh Popcorn Company is a wonderful little store located in a few locations. The location on Liberty Ave. used to be the one of my favorite little stops until \""The Incident\"" occurred. (See bottom of review)\n\nThey have different special flavors each month with a few standard mixes you can get anytime. If you like chocolate, check out the chocolate and caramel mix..it will make your hairs stand up in sugar coated glee. \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the staff is very nice despite the fact of knowing that they will have the smells of popcorn stained into their skin for months to come. \n\nThe only addition I would make to this place is to show movies and have a couch inside. That would be most enjoyable.\n\nIf you are in the area..definitely check out this spot. \n\n\n\n\""The Incident\""\n\nIt was a sunny day, I remember being in a more than normal good mood, a generous mood in fact. I strolled into the magical popcorn kiosk as it were and ordered some popcorn, a small bag because why kill myself since I knew I would in fact find a way to convince myself to finish every bit of it by the end of the day. \n\nI also ordered a root beer and the nice lady goes to the back to retrieve it. During that time I decide to leave a modest tip since I typically didn't. Well when I went to tip I hadn't realized I had thrown a 10 and not a 1 into the jar. My eyes grew wide and I realized my mistake. With some quick thinking I realized I could grab the 10 out and exchange it for a 1 since my overall cost was around 3 dollars to begin with. It was a great plan...\n\nUntil my hand got stuck in the jar. As I looked up with a panicked face I had 4 angry looking staff members seeing me trifle through their tips. I tried to explain how I had meant to only leave a 1 but then somehow it probably seemed that their efforts were not worth a 10 and thus either way I was an asshole. \n\nI strolled out in shame and haven't returned since. So if their are any employees currently reading this..I apologize, I was not stealing your tips. Next time, I'll the leave the 10 in there despite any mistake in the process."
1,"Great atmosphere, easy to book and get reservations, extensive wine list.. Mind boggling to say the least if you arent overly knowledgeable with wines like myself.  Antipasta appetizer was excellent.. Perfect blend of italian cheeses and meets.  I had the pasta sampler which included lobster gnocchi.. Obviously homemade gnocchi and cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent, very attentive waiter but not overly attentive which is good.  Price is as expected for a restaurant of this quality at the mgm grand hotel"
1,"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening. \n\nI go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference. \n\nA few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had \""rounded up\"" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again.\n\nThis afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought \""great, here we go again.\"" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference. \n\nI thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip.\nNow I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there. \n\nIt's amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples."
1,Intriguing flavorful combinations and an intimate atmosphere make for a fantastic dining experience
0,"I've eaten at Jersey Mikes Subs a few times... usually this location and I always find the subs lacking flavor. On top of that the prices are more expensive than Jimmy Johns, and I think JJs has better subs all around."
0,"If u wear chrome hearts, don't come here. I was asked to take off my shirt or leave cause it has fuck you on it. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? \n\nAlotta old timers and lil kids here maybe that's why I got flagged. The selection here at Studio B Is laughable compared to bacchanal. The food quality has went down the drain since the last time I was here about 2 years ago.\n\nAlso there is no express lane, so even if u had dough ur gonna have to wait the whole line.\n\nAnd seafood is only available on weekends \n\nWould probably not come here again"
0,"Here's the skinny:\n\nIt's pretty over priced for an Americanized Chinese place. Average dish was roughly $15-$20. \n\nThey have Vietnamese coffee w/boba, and it comes in a large = awesome, and SUPER strong too! They also have soy milk w/boba and fruit (watermelon, etc)..  prices are between $5-$7.\n\nTheir dishes come down to a few options:\n- beef\n- pork\n- soup\n- rice\n- noodles \n\n.. but I didn't come across any signature dishes you typically would at a true Chinese restaurant (ie. Pan fried noodles, combination plates like chow fun, etc).\n\nTheir white and orange hand blown glasses are really pretty, and the decor is cool too. Service was OK, and the food is cooked fresh. I could tell the noodles in our chow fun were hand made, I'd say those were my favorite of everything we had.  Oh!  the salt and pepper shrimp are yummy too!\n\nServings are 'A la carte (aka family style)' BUT the portions are smaller than a traditional Chinese place."
0,"I don't recommend this place. The front desk people were not very nice. My room was not ready and after finally having it ready at 530, after arriving at 1230, the room was dark, gloomy, smelly and overall very disappointing. I'll never stay here again. The walls are thin and you can hear it when people are walking above you. \n\nDon't buy into this timeshare!!!!"
1,"This is THE BEST pool party  in vegas!!  Reserved a small daybed for $500 for four of us and we hit the minimum easily.  Kaskade  was amazing, and the staff very helpful.  Only minor complaint was we didn't really find a drink on the menu that we loved-and found the drinks a little weak.  Would recommend getting a bottle instead next time."
0,"I am an ex Neiman Marcus employee and a life long fan of the company.\nMaybe my years working there and in customer service in general have built my standards higher than any outlet can live up to.\nBut seriously, whether its an outlet or the full line store, it still has the Neiman Marcus name attached to it. Is it too much to expect the basics of great customer service? Just the basics...\nApparently it is.\n10:45 AM, on a Thursday... Yeah that won't be the busiest of days, but is it really necessary to have only one cashier? And a slow one at that. There were 3 women in front of me each paying separately for a combined total of 7 items.\nI was in line for 18 minutes. \nThe cashier didn't have enough money in the register to give the woman immediately in front of me $14 change. She paid $40 cash for something that cost $26 and they couldn't give her change? Really??\nCome one Neiman Marcus. Step it up."
1,Bangers and mash with lots of options. Seriously I think there are about 10 different mashes and they have at least 4 different sausages each day. There's also 4 or 5 gravy options too. \n\nI tried their beef and Guinness (a special) and herby pork. Yum! I had the Moroccan mash and tomato and thyme gravy. Sort of an odd combination but it worked. Plus our meal came with cheery service!\n\nMum's has many local ales and ciders available. They pride themselves on local brews.\n\nAND they have alcoholic shakes on their menu. Bonus points from me!
0,"I was disappointed in this company.  I purchased their package for the strip night tour based on price and length of the flight.  There are many vendors and I wish I would have selected another.  It turned out that the price was higher than quoted on the internet, because it did not include fuel surcharge, but there was no mention of the fuel surcharge in the \""Best of Las Vegas Tours.com\"" description.  Also, the BOLVT website said the flight time was 20-25 minutes.  When the flight began, the pilot announced it was 10-12 minutes.  When I contacted BOLVT with my complaint about the discrepancy, they said it was a typo on their webpage (which they have now corrected).  The time it took to get to the facility, wait in the terminal, shuttle to the launch pad and wait for another tour to go before ours, then the extremely short trip of 10 minutes, where I was cramped into a middle seat and couldn't see much of anything, then waiting about a half hour in the shuttle after the trip before they bussed us back to the terminal, was not worth the time and money.  \n\nI was very disappointed in the reception and processing in the terminal.  The person working at the desk was a brand new employee with no formal training.  She was causing a lot of stress with the customers by insisting she needed a \""voucher\"" not an email printed confirmation of the reservation.  It turned out my name was in the system, but she had me very concerned for a few minutes.  Then the surprise extra charge, even though the Heli USA confirmation email said that after my deposit the \""Total Due at the Terminal is XXX\"" which included taxes and fees -- that was not true.  The total was an additional fuel charge added on.  Once my son and I finally were told our reservation had been processed and we could be seated in the terminal, where it was extremely warm and not air conditioned, I was already regretting that I had booked the reservation. The lines were extremely long, and nobody seemed to know what was going on.  Someone came out and asked for groups 3 and 4 to go to another room for a safety video, and then I realized that we were not told we were assigned to a group.  I had to go back to the front desk to find out what group we were assigned to.  \n\nIn the helicopter, they cram 6 people into a tiny cabin space.  I think the only people who got to see much were sitting next to the window on the inside that faced the strip.  I was in the middle. The person on the other (outside) window would not have been given a good view either direction because we did a circle around the strip.  There was a very confusing tutorial about how to work the gadget that controlled the headphones. The music really sucked and needs to be improved.  The pilot was boring.  A little bit of humor might have helped."
1,"Lenny's Sub Shop is a clone of Jersey Mike's.  So if you like Jersey Mike's, you'll probably like Lenny's.  In my opinion their subs are better because the meat is sliced fresh.  The staff here is very friendly and they aim to please.  The price is the same as most other sub shops."
0,"Let me start off by saying I wanted to LOVE this spa experience.  My Husband and I stayed at the Westin after our wedding and it holds centimental value for us, so when we were in need of a spa day recently the Westin was our first choice.  We booked the Travelzoo massage in advance and were greeted promptly upon our arrival.  Everything seemed to go well with check-in and we were shown to our respective locker rooms.  I didn't find the actual facilities to be anything special.  It had all the basic things and seemed a-ok.  Honestly, I don't even remember it well and that was less than a month ago.\n\nNow, the massage.  I have to say this in one of, if not the worst, massages I have ever had.  I asked for \""medium\"" pressure and got the massage of my nightmares.  She was so aggressive I thought I was going to be pushed right through the table.  It was awful, painful, and the complete opposite of relaxing. I spent most of the time wondering when it will be over.  I thought to myself this must be an annomoly, but NO, my Husband had the exact same experience.  He even asked his massuse to let up, but she didn't.  We both walked away more than disappointed.  Afterwards we hung out by the spa pool, which was nice and quiet compared to the main pool area.  Service was OK... honestly the best part of the whole day was the boneless buffalo wings and bannana smoothie.  Those were to die for.\n\nUpon reflection, I realized we never got our mimosa or foot massage as part of the Travelzoo package.  Just another disappointment, but I didn't even care to bring it to anyone's attention.  I really enjoy hitting up local spas during the summer and thanks to Travelzoo I usually get them at a good price for the quality.  This time, anything over $1 was too much for this spa experience.  To say we were disappointed is the understatement of the year.  We won't be back."
1,"Nice lunch spot in the Old Port for eating in or taking out. They do make good soups, but they also make good sandwiches and salads (although there's only one salad choice per day). The combos are where it's at: either soup and sandwich (half or full) or soup and salad. There are usually some unique flavour combinations on offer, although some days are better than others. If you go to eat in try to arrive early because it can get crowded and they don't take reservations."
0,"The food was disgusting and made me sick. The waitress had an attitude and looked like she'd rather be anywhere but there. I will never eat there again. Not worth it. The atmosphere was OK, you get over it after 5 minutes. I just wanted to leave. Plus the food is way overpriced. I would be happier eating a frozen dinner."
1,We had a great time at this restaurant.  The service is Excellent!  The Calamaretti appetizer was really good.   The pasta dishes my daughter and I ordered were good as well.  My husband said his pizza was delicious.  We had lunch and it was a great value.   The restaurant has a good vibe.  We would've liked to sit outside but is was really hot when we were in Vegas last month.  There is a car showroom downstairs that's pretty cool.  We'll definitely be back.
1,"I went here on Friday night which happened to be latin night and me and my girls had a lot of fun here.  We had been having bad luck with going to places that we thought were open...somehow Rumjungle was closed on a Thursday night around 12:45..and some other bar/restaurant was closed to remodeling.  We found this out ONCE we got to the places lol.  Anyway this definitely made our last night in Vegas a whole lotta fun.  I am latina so I was fiending for some good spanish music.  This was the place!!!  The reggaeton was goood..even the rock en espanol was good (I'm not a big fan of rock en espanol).  There is another room right by the restrooms that plays English music...rap mostly.  So if you get tired of hearing the spanish..you can walk over to the other room.  The bartenders were fairly nice and the beers were a pretty decent price.  This club is located right by the casino which was great because I was able to sit and play the slots while I waited for my girlfriend who refused to leave this place. My feet were killing me so I had to leave..otherwise I would have stayed with pleasure :)  This is a GREAT spot only if you're interested in spanish music (reggaeton, bachata, rock en espanol, salsa, etc.)  If I'm back in Vegas I will DEFINITELY go here again."
0,"I was not impressed with this place. First we got seated in a corner with other couples who's tables were little too close. Service was ok they often come back to refill your drink, water was good. Bread was flavorful, quality was good. First ordered kobe beef slider for appetizer, small bite size but decent flavor.  Ordered kurobuta double pork chop which was the most disappointing entre ever. It had NO flavor but a piece of meat in this big fancy plate. Even I could have seasoned it better than this!!! Asked for some sauce to go with it , not even the sauce was good just tasted like regular BBQ sauce. Roast beef Wellington was better but didn't have that wow factor for a signature dish. Made reservation and mentioned that it was for a bday prior to dinner, but no cake served. Definitely was not worth the money."
1,"So happy to have found this restaurant, it was the complete package for night out. \n\nFirst, the decor welcomes you in and sets the mood... \nBeautiful lighting, check\nMiro artwork, check\nBeautiful bar area and classy place settings, checkity check.\n\nNext up, the food and drink. I ordered the Paella de Pollo and a number of Tapas. Everything was delicious and came out hot and fresh from kitchen. No overwhelming spices and heat in these dishes--the flavors are more subtle and carefully prepared. Pre-dinner rolls were not the best, but I did not want to fill up on that anyway.  There was a decent wine selection and full bar for drinks.  Drinks have nice flavor but are not made strong, so if you are a booze hound, you've been warned.  The prices are medium-high, not outrageous for a restaurant in this area.\n\nFinally the entertainment. This is just an added bonus that takes the restaurant to the next level.  You can enjoy Spanish guitar and Flamenco while dining? Yes. And it is fantastic.  Be aware, some people come just to enjoy the music, so there will be people hovering about the tables during the performance. It can get a bit crowded near stage (bordering on claustrophobic).  And while I enjoyed the atmosphere-some people might not. But if you love live music and the energy that comes with it, you wont be disappointed.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit or three. Muy bien!!"
0,"While I was staying at the HRH Tower, I won a meal voucher at Mr. Lucky's 24-7.\n\nWe weren't really planning on using it, but on the last day, we decided to check out their breakfast menu since it seemed like the most convenient option at the time - we had very little time left before we needed to leave for SoCal. \n\nSince I was attempting to cut my calories and focus on consuming more protein-heavy meals, I ordered the  \""Gambler's Special,\"" which included a bowl of salad, an 8oz sirloin steak, three jumbo shrimp, and garlic mashed potatoes for $7.77. For the size of the steak I got and the jumbo shrimp, $7.77 is definitely a steal.\n\nDid it taste good? Was it quality food? I don't know. It was definitely a little on the oily side, but I did appreciate that the shrimp was not overcooked. As far as the steak is concerned, It seemed like your regular USDA Select cut of meat, and was a little on the tough side.\n\nOverall.. my expectations were very low, and appropriately so."
1,The food was really delicious! Compliments to the chef! I loved the chocolate malt! :)\nThe atmosphere really reflected the 1950's. I love how there are hula-hoops in the front; so fun! The staff was very friendly. Our waitress was super nice.\n\nI would recommend to a friend! :)
0,"What happened to the Mirage Buffet that I remember from years ago?  We had dinner at Cravings because we were watching a show at the Mirage during our stay in Vegas.  There was no wait for the dinner buffet priced at $29 per person and we were shown to our table.  \n\nThe buffet has been remodeled since my last visit and it isn't good.  I felt like I was dining in a square shaped school cafeteria and the servers also looked liked they worked in a school cafeteria.....all they were missing was a hair net, lol.  \n\nThe buffet stations are located all along the four walls of the restaurant and the seating area was in the middle.  No ambiance at all...disappointing.  Our server, Mildred explained all of the buffet stations....seafood, Italian, American, Asian, Salad, and Dessert stations.   \n\nMy dinner buffet consisted of the following:\n*  Cold Cracked Crab Legs - They were frozen and were defrosting in the buffet container.  \n*  Shrimp Cocktail -  Nothing Special\n*  Steamed Mussels - Again, nothing special\n*  Sauteed Fish Fillet - Salty\n*  Sauteed Broccolini - Fresh and delish!\n*  Salad - Made to order and tasty.  There were also a couple of types of pre-made salads which were fresh.\n*  Roast Beef - Dry and overcooked.\n*  Desserts - Cafeteria looking desserts....enuff said.\n\nMy dinner buffet at Cravings was disappointing.  I only enjoyed my salad and some of the vege entrees for $29....plus, the setting was like a mess hall.  I wouldn't return for dinner again.  2 Stars."
0,"This review is rated on shopping at this location not boarding or grooming. First of all the prices at PetSmart in general are to high and keep going up. I only go there because they are the closest for me.I purchase my dog food at Pet Supermarket because it is $3 less per bag. I will probably start purchasing all my cat at dogs needs at Pet Supermarket. Where to start? It is always chaotic in that store and why must the dog trainer be in front of the store by the registers? If the training is not up front they are up and down the aisles making it difficult to shop. I thought they had a little area off to the side?  I don't recall every having a great shopping experience here. One time I was going to purchase a large cat tree and 2 male employees watched me carry it to the front and never offered to help. I found out it was not the one on sale so did not buy. I carried it back to where I found it and the same 2 employees watched me, again never offering to help. The location of this store does not help after you search forever for a parking space you would hope to have a good experience and reasonable prices to make it worth your bother."
1,So easy to stop in and get a quick coffee
1,"Rave is ok, but it is usually very crowded on the weekends. It is located in a mall so that is to be expected. I have seen many movies here and I have never had any issues. The inside is always clean and the employees are attentive.\n\nI have also been to several midnight premieres here and they are also very well organized getting everyone in and to the correct place in an orderly manner."
1,They have the BEST springrolls---not fried!  We also love their pad thai---spiced to your palate.
0,"The Short Story:\nThe management is unfriendly and unapologetic if their staff makes mistakes.\n\nJenna, the lead bartender, trains the bartenders to intentionally pour the draft beer with extra head so as to give customers less beer (I've heard this is because of a bonus system the place uses for management).  Her personality is abrasive and in general she is not pleasant to be around.  If you see she is the bartender (she is a tall woman with shortish hair and tattoos), I would suggest getting a table instead of sitting at the bar.\n\nI used to be somewhat of a regular here, but the attitude of the staff (management and bartenders especially) is so rude and unwelcoming that I have no desire to ever go back again.  There are plenty of other businesses in the immediate area that will actually appreciate my (and your) business.\n\nIf you want pizza on Mill Ave, you're better off hitting up La Bocca (across the street) or try Slices (on 6th street). You could also go around the corner to Oregano's on University Dr."
1,"This is one of those special bookstores staffed by real live writers and that fact, rather than membership in any particular trade or professional association, is what lends a bookstore credibility."

1,"*****This place calling itself Bachi Burger may throw some off it's Bao meets, Boba, meets grillarama****** \n\nI wish these guys had got in before the Subway on the corner of the building it's a much better spot. The interior is really not to my liking too stark and boring. They are new so this may change but it really seems like it was the look that they were going for. The staff was nice though the waitresses seemed nervous and uncomfortable it's all new so I am looking past all of this. I had the Kalbi burger it was really good I'm a kimchi fan so it was right up my alley. This thing is messy as hell in a good way 4 napkin minimum. My only wish on my burger was that they use a rougher cut of Kimchi. The salt and pepper fries are solid they toss a few jalapenos in for effect as well. On the drinks side they have a good selection of beers although they are a little up there in price if I'm paying 7 dollars for a Sapporo it had better be a large format bottle. I will definitely go back if for nothing else to tear through all the Bao selections and have an order of fish & chips. One note, the buns are a little sweet and may throw some off, I thought they were great and very fresh."
1,"In L.A., you see Mexican fast-food-ish-type restaurants who feel the need to offer you not only Mexican, but burgers and fries, too...at Acapulco, however, they've traded burgers and fries for sandwiches. I'm not really sure I get the whole Mexican-Sandwich Fusion concept, but I thought the food was pretty good nonetheless.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Cheese Quesadilla Lunch Special, which was pretty scrumptuous...and was actually quite a lot of food, particularly for lunch (which I love, cause I'm always complaining that lunch portions are too small...). The plate was kind of piled high with quesadilla goodness, and it came with a nice, big side of guacamole (I love guacamole...). The quesadillas themselves were dripping with grease a little more than I cared for, but besides that, no complaints...they tasted great (lots of cheese and chicken) and were especially good with a little guac smeared on top...mmmmm.....\n\nI'm sure I'll be back here again."
1,"Ugly Cakes Bakery's sweet treats are to die for.  I am a sucker for sweets...but not just any sweets.  I know what's good and what isn't.  The minute I tried the Carrot Cake I thought I died and went to heaven.  But it didn't end there.  Then I tried some cookies...and then some fudge...and 'tis the season for Pumpkin Rolls!!! I wanted to cry when I ran out.  \n\nSeriously -- not only are the treats amazing and baked with some major TLC, the souls behind the company are treasures themselves.  Awesome branding, awesome concepts, awesome food, awesome people.  \n\nHighly recommend them to anyone -- even if you dont think you like sweets, you'll like theirs.  I promise!!!!!!"
1,"First off, this is not a car wash..it is a car experience for both you and your car!\nNever have I seen such care go into a car cleaning. It appeared the car was doubled washed, even the gas door and cap were washed and dried. This wasn't a special wash but the standard care every car received. \n\nDon't be in a hurry, or bring the soccer team with you. It isn't that kind of place.  I'm sure the employees wouldn't mind but the Client's in the leather covered couches waiting for there cars might. \n\nNow, let's talk price, they probably spent 40 minutes with my car. Two to 4 people working on my mid sized car at all times. The price $20.00! I don't think they charged enough...Plus, check in on Yelp during your stay and get $2.00 off. Can you say BARGIN :-)\n\nMy car wasn't this clean when it was picked up at the dealer."
0,"Worst service after. Mailman said he delivered my package even though I never relieved it. I was told i should have insured it.  Why should i pay extra to insure a package when ive already paid to have it shipped? usps is a scam and apparently are allowed to steal packages if there\n isnt any insurance. ive filed a claim through him and was supposed to get a response back last week. Every time I try to call the post office, the line is busy."
0,Arrived at 9:30pm the place was 90% empty but we still waited almost 15 minutes before a server even asked us what we would like to drink.   I had always avoided Joes but it was the only place open so we gave it a chance.  Slow service mediocre to lousy food.  Need I say more?  Will not be back.
0,"This review is strictly for the portrait studio. One word..CHAOS.\n\nI received a gift session and I was more than happy to get my daughter's first Christmas cards done. It was a mad house from the second we stepped into the studio.\n\nI understand it's the holiday season; I get it..really I do. But booking a session at a certain time, should fall within that time-give or take 10-15 minutes. NOT 90 minutes after that time.\n\nI had a 5 month old infant with me..and lets say she wasn't happy sitting around, waiting for 90 minutes, to get a very sour, overworked, and probably really tired photographer.\n\nNo guidance, no instruction or attempts by this person to work with my kid. Plop child on this dot, snap picture. Yes my daughter was fussy..but YOU guys were late..what happens? I ask if I can feed her, only to learn, that our slot has been taken and we have to wait again. WHAT?!\n\nNow, our second photographer was a thousand times better which is why I added another star. He really did all he could to get our daughter to smile without seeming angry or bored, or upset. But like I said, 90 minutes with a child waiting, and your not going to get a happy baby in pictures. The person who then tries to pick poses and templates with you was just not...professional. She was suggesting the most horrid pictures possible. Nightmare!\n\nI stuck around because it was a gift, and I was not going to be ungrateful, but I will not be using this studio ever again."
0,"First time eating here. Lunch today, not impressed. Had the chicken ranch with fries. Not the best cut of chicken. Nothing outstanding that would want me to come back. Others in the party had burgers. Nothing to write home about. \nJust average."
1,I really like this place and feel lucky that it's the only Razzos that open up out of Texas. I come here for the reasonably price crawfish and stuff shrimp. The drinks are pretty cool. They have fish bowls drinks that can be share with your gf. I never could pass up on their drink on weekend.
0,"I've been to this Subway twice and both times I have been disappointed.\n\nFirstly - it appears that none of the workers behind the counter communicate well (mainly the cashier and the sandwich maker).\n\nOn two different occasions, spanning 2-3 months, I have been OVERCHARGED for my sandwich.  I have to check my receipt and then wait another 5-10 minutes to get my refund.\n\nThe assembly line leaves much to be desired as well.  I did not want to \""go there\"" but I clearly communicate what I want on my sandwich at other subways just fine but the workers here appear to struggle with the English language.\n\nI do frequent other Subways and they are very efficient in building sandwiches.  This one, not so much.  The management here really needs to train their workers better."
1,"A non formal Italian-American eatery with east coast roots and tastes. A busy Friday night we waited about 20 mins for a table. As your seated your are served garlic knots and bread. My first time there in 5 years I went all out. We ordered our favorites: calamari, rice ball parm, chicken parm hero and eggplant with pasta. Everything was good and in true Italian American style it had plenty of cheese and sauce. Service was outstanding! Our waitress was at our table checking on us regularly. We order cannoli for desert to go and to our surprise a dozen cookies"
0,"I'm a local girl serious about my hookah. Me and boyfriend decided to try a new place so we consulted Yelp (of course). Luna lounge was terrible. The staff was inattentive and unhelpful. Our beers were empty for a good 20 minutes before I went to the bar to get the check (no refill needed at that point). The hookah was a tad harsh. We asked for an ice tip and instead they put ice cubes in the tray. When getting our smoke on me and my man like to snuggle close...who doesn't? Impossible at Luna Lounge. Instead of the comfy couches usually seen in these types of establishments, they had uncomfortable individual chairs. My man is only 6' tall but his legs were cramping up. The environment certainly doesn't encourage staying awhile and trying multiple hookah flavors. The DJ played some sort of international music, maybe a draw for some, but certainly not what you want to hear when vibing out is the goal. I will not be back and do not recommend this place for anyone other than tourists staying in the area."
0,"I should have done better 'due diligence' on the front end and maybe never have walked in here to begin with.  It is hard to be a pizza joint in this part of town considering all the outstanding competition in the neighborhood too.  Everything looked pre-made and not fresh.  All the pizzas were preheated with toppings on them ready to go, before you even get there, then they fire it in an oven when a pizza is ordered.  \n\nSince the pizzas didn't look particularly appetizing, I had asked about substituting capicola (which was on another sub on the menu) for the ham on the Italian sub and the server said they were already pre-prepared.  I opted for the barbeque chicken pizza the gentleman at the counter suggested.  The crust was not good; it was kind of like Boboli bread.  The servers were nice, but unfortunately I can not say the same for the food."
0,"Avoid the drive thru.!!!! They never get the order right. \n\nHere is a list of other problems.\n-they serve expired food ..pies with date stamps from 2days earlier.\n-tables are rarely clean\n-drinks are watery\n-employees are not friendly\n-managers don't care and seem to even encourage poor servce.\n\n...i could go on and on, but why waste my time with these fools."
0,"I don't get it.  This does not do bbq justice.  bbq should be at a no-frills joint with limited service, a clear view of the smoker, and paper towels everywhere.  this looks more like a chili's.\n\nOrdered the ribs and tasted mostly the sauce.  Which is okay sauce, but not the main draw when you order ribs.\n\nAlso the service was pretty mediocre to unprofessional."
1,"Only been there once but would definitely want to go back again. All day dim sum! The food was good but it being dim sum, sometimes it freshly made and some if it was probably a few hours old and cold by the time it got to us. Went there early afternoon on a Saturday I think and it was fairly empty and they didn't have as many runners and food going around so it took a while for us to get a decent amount of food on our table. I don't know when their prime hours are but it's probably better if you go sometime around there where they're expecting to have a lot of people, thus more food being prepared and it being more fresh. I'd definitely go there again.\n\nHad two tvs but what they were airing was completely random. The big screen had a soccer game going on and there's another screen up front by the waiting area and that was airing Entertainment Tonight or something."
1,"Best Chinese food around. Grom traditional to thai it is by far the best taste there is. I always start with the lettace wraps. The dtringbeans are wonderful. No matter what dish you order, you will love it"
1,"\""Whoa, what?!  Pinball Hall of Fame?  Are you serious?!\"" I thought when I saw the listing. \""This can't be real.\""  But it was, it was!  \n\nAs a very serious adult type person, I decided to tell one of the coolest kids in my life about this.  After watching about 3 videos of the place, he was absolutely jumping up and down.  This may be an 11 year old's biggest dream come true, and there is no entry fee, no catches or gimmicks, just a whole lotta pinball machines, game machines, candy machines, even a moustache machine for some reason!  \n\nEvery day I saw him from the day I showed him the videos on, he asked, \""Can we go to the Pinball Hall of Fame TODAY?  I have $20 in quarters!!!\""  Tonight, I finally gave in and we made the trek down Tropicana to this nondescript, illustrious wonder of a place.  Upon entry through the door, the place was truly a wonder to behold.  Four double-sided rows (or more!) of pinball games, a solid row of old school arcade games (the original Punch Out, Tetris, and Super Mario Bros - even Joust!), multiple quarter candy machines (Reece's Pieces, cashews, gumballs), and even the claw games you can never really win (but you sure do try!)\n\nWe played Indiana Jones pinball, The Simpsons pinball, Super Mario Bros pinball, Ripley's Believe It or Not pinball, Flintstones pinball, Stargate pinball, and on and on until we had spent about $30 or so.  Lots of the machines had 5 balls instead of just three and extra game deals if you purchased more than one game.  It was fun remembering that if you matched the numbers at the end of the game, you actually won another free game!  We loved the games with multiball and really dug the games that gave you your ball back when you lost it too quickly (happens a lot during pinball, but you usually lose the ball!) \n\nHe found an old school basketball game that was kind of mechanical and cool and a neat shoot 'em up game where you hit moving targets.  We played the last one together for a while and he loved the fact that there were actually moving parts instead of just an electronic screen!  (Ahh, back in the day, right?)  \n\nBy some magic, we made it out with quarters left, big smiles and ran right into a boatload of traffic on the Strip - but, it was entirely worth it.  Highly recommended entertainment and a real blast from the past - especially for us 80's kids turned \""very serious adult type people\"" who remember the good old days when whatever was wrong in your life, a roll full of quarters and a good arcade could make it all better."
1,"The pho is delicious, and the prices are fantastic.  Definitely a hole in the wall and very authentic (not much English spoken here).  Down side is that they don't serve beer (wha?! who doesn't drink beer with their pho?!) but otherwise 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  Will come here whenever we're on this side of town."
0,Horrible customer service. Lines were so long and only 2 people working the registers.
0,The worst place I've ever ate the manager be Littles the employees why you're trying to eat thank God there's an in and out burger right across the street
1,"Well I stopped by the Borgata the other day and noticed Slo Foods Organic Cafe and figured I would pop in for a bite with a friend. Right now, it seems that they are starting with a soft opening and might do a grand opening thing in a few weeks once they get the kinks out. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and will have a market next door where you can buy all the products they use. It's similar to Duck and Decanter, LGO and Herb Box DC Ranch in this regard but the market doesn't look like it will open for a few more weeks.\n\nThe atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing, the place has a nice patio overlooking the a the main square. Since Slo Foods Cafe is new and it was about 1:30p.m it was also very empty. I ordered the Avocado sandwich for and some iced Tazo green tea and my friend had a blackberry or blueberry juice (excellent) and the Turkey Burger. The food was good and I'm sure I'll go back once everything is a bit more set up. The management seems very receptive to feedback and I'm sure if you provide it they would try to incorporate it.\n\nI think this place has potential especially since they are so focused on obtaining extreme high quality organic ingredients. I'll be sure to stop by again."

1,"My wife and I go here about every six weeks or so. We love the pepperoni and Jalape\u00f1o as well as the white pizza with crumbled sausage or turkey on it. Sometimes we add ricotta. We were a little bummed with our most recent visit to find out they no longer have a fully stocked bar. Beer and wine only. The selection of beer and wine is okay. The service is always on point. We found the best way to enjoy the pizza is asking the server to have the cook's leave the pizza in the oven for a little extra time. This way the crust stays from becoming soggy so quickly. Over the years they have added a few locations. I use to go to the one in DC ranch, now its at the Scottsdale quarter. Once went to the Glendale location. All in all the service is consistent across all locations. Great place to pop in for a quick pizza. Don't go overboard on toppings as the cost will add up quickly. Bring the full service bar back to the old town location!"
0,"This gym is awful! They do not play music so it is dead quiet, they keep it so hot that I've actually called down to the front desk while on the elliptical machine to complain, they really don't need to light that giant fireplace when it's 50 degrees outside, they have an entire room devoted to spin but do not have any classes between 11 and 5 and when they do have a class it is hot, humid and smelly from the class before, speaking of spin class, they are so dark and loud you can neither see nor hear the instructor let alone check your form in the mirror or compete with your neighbor. The price for membership is off the charts, the only nice thing about this place are the personal trainers."
0,"My husband and I went here on a Friday morning for breakfast and it was packed. We thought this was a good sign, until we got our food. I had a waffle with bananas and scrambled eggs and bacon. I the waffle was like cardboard. I couldn't eat more than one bite. I ate most of my eggs, but I felt nauseous afterwards. I also ordered hot chocolate which was pretty good, but thats about it. My husband didn't like his food either - an omelet with sausage links.  The plate with the sausage was swimming in grease. He couldn't even look at it, never mind taste it. We won't be back b/c of the quality of the food."
0,"They are on the Banned List. Sorry Tots, I wanted to like you.\nFirst time had the Sheczuan Chicken. It had sugar syrup sauce like orange chicken sauce with added chili flakes. Nasty and missing something. Fried rice was bland and old. \n\nSecond trip had the chicken lomein, again missing flavor and tasted old. Noticed 2 employees eating lunch and they had Pizza from another restaurant?\n\nThere are way better choices around that area, no need to go back."
1,"This place is amazing... had all of my pants hemmed here and they always did a fantastic job at VERY cheap prices. They knew me by name after a few visits, and even let me in a few times after closing. If I needed something back fast they were always accommodating. I even had a bridesmaid dress altered here and they did it for under $50 - can't complain at all!!!!"
1,"If Raku had a location near my house, I would probably go everyday. I'm not kidding--Raku is THAT good. Normally, on trips to Vegas, we usually venture to restaurants on the strip, but after seeing the reviews for this place we knew we had to give it a shot. And boy, am I glad we did!\n\nWe started off with the house special tofu (both cold and hot)---probably the best dish out of all the plates. The texture of the tofu is out of this world--creamy, yet firm with great flavor! If my love for tofu wasn't already beyond the fence, this dish kicked it out of the world! A MUST. \n\nWe also ordered:\nfoie gras- super creamy, melts in your mouth\npork cheek-great smokey flavor\nasparagus- again great flavor\ngrilled duck--slightly gamey and chewy\nchicken breast with crispy skin-SO SO GOOD. not dry at all, full of flavor\n(small bite) chicken and egg-(This is similar to a don bowl, amazing taste and great portion size on top of the tapas)\nkobe steak-it's kobe beef! enough said. \npork ears-crunchy texture and great flavor\n\nOn top of our wonderful dining experience, we also saw Olympian Apollo Anton Ohno sitting behind us!! He was with an Iron Chef contestant and some other people. If Apollo and an Iron Chef contestant eats here, I think you're in good shape to experience a fantastic meal here. \n\nCan't wait to go back!"
1,"Their Panang is so delicious here!  I could swim in their curry... it is so flavorful whether it's red, yellow, or green curry.  They have many lunch specials to choose from, and the service matches the food-- it's great!"
1,I gotta admit i liked this place a lot. The food was really really good. Ive already planned what I'm ordering the next time i go! The counter area could have been a little more productive when it came to helping customers but once you've ordered the service was quick. I ordered the Sin City burger with sweet potato fries and i was so pleased with this meal. I would def suggest this place for a quick bite to eat at a fair price! Super easy to find and alot of parking here...Def check this place out!!!!
1,P2 and you're in pho heaven. They don't rush you out. Toddlers do get place in the corner table but as a parent I can appreciate that
0,They do not respect our flag!!! A business should have more respect for our country and address issues like this.
1,This was a great venue for my first concert at the Joint. We saw Prince on Friday night and would see him from the floor and from the suite. What a show!
1,Both my father and I enjoyed this show a lot. I think it's good for all.ages. If you have children that get scared easily be warned that there are a few scary charaters in a few scenes. But all in all it is visually impressive some acts are breathtaking and the music was awesome. Modern meets chinese. You could tell a lot of hard work and creativity went into making this spectacular show happen!
0,"Terrible Takeout! Do not go!\nI called in my order, simple two omelet, with some fruit and tomatoes on the side. Nothing crazy. So I got thought the extended diatribe on the phone clarifying and identify I understand the extra charges for a side of tomatoes, the cashier says 10 minutes.\nI get to the restaurant about 6 minutes later only to sit and wait another 20 or so, the price of which had never been disclosed to me. $11 per 4-egg omelet. I was a little shocked, but then my order was also wrong, they missed my extras and wanted to charge me even more for simple stuff like an ounce of tomatoes. I'm trying to grin and bare it, when the cashier dashes off without a word to get her manager, because she doesn't actually know the cost of said side of tomatoes. The manager comes out with a half -ass-ed apology and an offer to \""take care of me\"" the NEXT time I choose to suffer through this establishment's shotty service.\nSo now that I've arrived at my office a whole 3 minute drive away, My fruit cup was leaking all over the bag of food. Each meal was luke warm, the ranch potatoes nearly broke a tong of my plastic fork, which we received one less than requested. My crazy chicken  omelet, which is described as \""Loaded with julienned chicken breast, fresh mushrooms and guacamole. Topped with muenster cheese and sour cream.\"" on the website, had flavorless dark meat chicken, and mushy old guacamole that was terrible.\nDon't trouble yourself with this establishment, food should be a delight, not a stressful experience."
1,"I was going to downtown Las Vegas last night for a show, so I decided to stop for dinner at the Bar + Bistro.  I made one error in that it was First Friday in the Arts District and the restaurant has an abbreviated menu for that evening.\n\nI went with two of their tapas plates and a dessert.  I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.  The second dish was their 5 cheese mac and cheese a combination of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp.  The pasta was gigli.  The mac and cheese was very tasty, too!\n\nI rounded out my dinner with a warm chocolate ganache cake.  It, too, was excellent.  It was served with a small scoop of sorbet and it was a perfect ending.\n\nAll things considered, I'd rather have come here on a night when I could have ordered from the full menu, but I had the chance to taste some of their good cuisine.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I enjoyed the decor a lot.  The tables shaped like artists' palettes with a metal well in many.  One thing that got me several times was the thought that I had dripped something onto the table.  When I looked, it was merely some spattered paint when they were decorating the tables.  Every time I looked down, it was a \""gotcha.\"""
0,"Wicked Spoon used to be one of our favorite buffets to visit while in Vegas.  They used to have exotic meats and flavorful dishes unique from other establishments on the strip.  I visited the buffet a couple days ago and was severely disappointed in number of ways.\n\nThe Cosmo decided the original price of the buffet wasn't high enough and have raised their dinner prices to $47 a person.  The price hike wasn't a huge deal as long as they improved their food selections and kept it unique.  Rather, what we saw were dry prime rib, flavorless shrimp balls and lots of generic foods you'd find at any buffet up and down the strip.  The place lost its exotic foods they once had.  \n\nGoing forward, we'll probably skip this buffet as its no longer special and the increase in price really caused a decrease in quality.  Cosmo management screwed up what was once a great place to eat and made it mediocre and bland."
1,"Located in the MGM Hotel.  I came here kind of spontaneously with my family.  We were starving in the area and some Italian sounded good to us.  Service was descent.  Wine/Alcohol options are presented on an iPad, which is unique.  Overall, it's a descent restaurant and I had a pleasurable experience.\n\n\nCRISPY CALAMARI:  It met my calamari standards.  A lot of the calamari pieces came in octopus shaped pieces haha.  \n\nKOBE BEEF MEATBALLS:  Huge meatballs that we split amongst us.  Packed with flavor and it was awesome.  It came with ciabatta bread that is perfect for dipping into the pomodoro sauce.  \n\nSEAFOOD PLATTER: An appetizer dish that has a little bit of everything.  It comes with 4 oysters on a half shell, 4 prawns, half a lobster tail, and ahi tuna tartare.  I loved everything.  The tuna tartare had a kick to it, which was perfect for a spicy lover like me.\n\nFIAMMA TRIO OF PASTA TASTING: This dish gives a tasting of three of the Chef's Favorite Pasta Dishes.  I don't think you'll be full as the picture I took shows the portion size.  I would suggest getting the actual dish instead.  Here were the pastas...\n\n---TRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI: This lobster gnocchi was really good.  You can taste the truffle and the gnocchi is made really fresh.  I understand its popularity!  It was the only one I think worth ordering of the three.\n---AGNOLOTTI: This was beef, veal, and pork ravioli.  I didn't like the flavor of this at all. I can't even tell you what bothered me, but I just didn't enjoy it.\n---ORECCHIETTE: This was broccoli and spiced sausage with tomatoes and pasta.  This was just average and came out just what I expected.\n\nRAVIOLINI:  This was my order of the night and it was great!  Usually ravioli entrees come with three or four fat raviolis and you're left hungry.  This dish came out with a bunch and I left perfectly content.  The truffle cream is amazing and the short rib ravioli is really yummy!\n\nHOMEMADE FETTUCCINE:  This is such a filling plate.  The fettuccine is well made and the creamy basil pesto sauce is good.  The sauce is quite dominant and strong, so a head's up to those who don't like that.  Prawns were big and scattered in the dish. \n\nBAROLO BRAISED SHORT RIB:  The flavor of the braised short rib was amazing.  To me it had a hint of asian seasoning and this is definitely a great choice for those who are craving meat."
1,"Second time for lunch here and once for dinner.  Consistently good.  Nice atmosphere, but can be noisy when busy.  Really like covered outdoor patio."
1,"I checked this place out with friend and loved it! Great atmosphere, best chocolate martini I have ever had made by Courtney, best spinach artichoke dip anywhere!"
0,"OMG! The broiling temperature's in Las Vegas have caused the chef at Nora's to have a meltdown!  When we had lunch today, we asked to have some of the vinegar and oil with our bread basket. The waiter explained that they did not serve balsamic vinegar anymore ( as a side) because the so called chef thought that the AMERICAN balsamic vinegar contained the TOXIC ingredient of FRUCTOSE. Yet, he had no problem serving us the saturated fat meat plate that would eventually kill us. While we discussed this among ourselves that it must be a cost cutting decision, the chef came out and berated us and proceeded to try to explain his philosophy on the reason for eliminating this very essential product served in all Italian restaurant's. He made us aware that to add vinegar to his loss leading cost of $1.75 to give his patrons bread and oil would not be beneficial to him as a business man. Hence, our original argument of cost costing was correct. This nut job chef, was so upset that we didn't by his excuse of trying to save us from making our own decisions about what we choose as ADULTS to put in our body that the he told us to leave the restaurant. I know, unbelievable! He followed and stalked us to the front door making condescending remarks and then blessing us as we left. This chef claimed he was a business owner and chef. As a business owner, you don't make unsolicited attacks against your customers because they don't agree with your bullshit philosophy. I want my vinegar!"
0,"There's no denying that Terry Fator can sing, and its practically tragic that a man with such vocal talent is forced to rely on crappy puppet theater to sell tickets. Unfortunately, crappy puppet theater is really all you get, featuring painfully easy jokes which could only appeal to a crowd too weak to stomach a real comedian, with such unique characters as \""stereotypical stoner\"" and stereotypical homosexual.\""\n\nI was almost willing to forgive the weak comedy, as I truly enjoyed the novelty of seeing Fator croon an incredible range of hits without moving his mouth. Unfortunately, the man completely lost me with his desperate original numbers. Nothing says a \""night of laughs\"" like a song about a kid dying of cancer and getting a horse from Jesus. Holy crap did that come out of nowhere.\n\nWatching people give this man a standing ovation was like watching America die."
0,"PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Once they have your credit card and deposit, they will ignore you and not return your call.  I left over 10 messages and emails because they were late to pick up my car 1 week.  I had to pay storage fees of over $200.  Maria (the owner) answers the phone and pretends she is not Maria.  Several times she did this and did not forward my messages. After calling maria with a blocked caller id, she picks up the phone and plays dumb about being late.  When you confront her, she will curse and go crazy.  She is the biggest liar i have dealt with and not very stable.  If you want to save yourself time, the headache and stress, please use a different company."
1,"Stopped in to grab a bite after Christmas shopping. We got it to go and it was all still hot and/or fresh when we go it home. The portion sizes are generous too. I got the Katsu Chicken with all mac and no rice. I was given a good helping of mac in addition to the good helping of chicken. It was a quick in and out. The chicken was flavorful and tender. The sauce was tasty and plentiful. L and L was as good as any other Hawaiian BBQ I've had in the area. I will definitely be back. The only drawback here is that they don't have Crab Rangoon. Three and a half stars for the missing Rangoon. No half star ratings, but good enough to round up."
1,"I love Treehouse Bakery! It happens to be about a 20 second walk from my house so I love to pop in and bring some delicious treats home. My favorite cupcakes are their champagne and macaroon cupcakes, but the classic vanilla and chocolate are always a great choice too. My boyfriend loves their homemade poptarts as well. If you're looking for a refreshment then try one of their iced teas. They have a selection of 3 herbal teas, locally sourced I believe. I forgot what the tea I got was called but it was minty and delicious!"
0,"Worst buffet ever made in vegas. Basically a rip off ($35 each), with just a straight line of selection. Food was not even that great, the only highlight was the steak, the creme brulee, and unlimited wine. But if you're at a buffet, you want various selection of food not just wine. \n\nI don't recommend this at all, especially if you're starving and they tell you that they're serving \""gourmet\"" food, most likely thats a lie."
0,Not a fan. They emailed me after receiving 650 worth of work to say I still needed 900 more. News to me. When I emailed them back I heard nothing. Hasn't fallen apart in the several months since so I guess it was a mistake.
1,"On short notice once moved into a new house, I called Bryan and he was able to come over and install a few ceiling fans and some new switches to control them and the lights.  Even though some modification had to be done to the wall for the bigger switch he didn't leave a mess.  Laid down some drop cloths and cleaned up before he left... \n\nMy rooms are cooler now and I'm happy about that... nice guy too!"
1,"I was so looking forward our dinner here. I took my husband here for his 30th birthday and I waited for this day like a kid that's ready to meet Mickey & Co.    Few hours prior to our dinner, I ended up having the worst stomach ache and I couldn't even try anything, other then a bite of caviar(YUMMO), a bite of his lobster dish.   Shame, Shame, Shame (on me).\nHe ended up polishing 12 course meal all by himself and walked out of there like he just had the best sex ever. I'm sure it was orgasmic by his reaction. Since I can't speak too much for the food, I will just say their decor was over the top and the service was bit \""smothering\"" to say the least.  Our waiter literally stood right next to our table while we were eating the entire time (while I was sipping on hot water/lemon).  \nOhhhh.. and the candy wagon they brought out at the end. OMG!!!!!"
0,"There are only so many occasions you want to write a review about and this is not a nice one.\nI had salmon and it was dry. Really dry. Rice and veggies were very just stale. Overall I'd rate my dish as DO NOT EAT.\nMy friends had:\nFriend A) tomato soup. Pretty good actually.\nFriend B) Caesar salad - the portion is quite big, but not tasty. Most of the salad was left untouched.\nFriend C) 3 shrimps. Not sure what is the  name of the dish, but there was literally 3 shrimps. The shrimps were ok, but there were only so many of them.\n\nThere are so many nice places on the strip, please be mindful of this one."
0,"I gave this place 2 stars because I liked the antipasto salad.  The rest was the worst Italian food I've ever eaten. Chicken marsala was chicken with beef gravy,  or at least that's what it tasted like. Crab stuffed mushrooms were awful, greasy,  and no crab taste whatsoever.  Marinara on the chicken parm tasted like it came out of a jar. Anyone giving this place a good rating either doesn't know what good food is our they havea vested interest in the business"
1,"After reading reviews of steak houses in the Scottsdale area where my wife and I were planning a vacation, I decided to go with Maestro's City Hall due to the abundance of positive reviews of lack of negative reviews.\n\nYelpers definitely steered me in the right direction as this was one fantastic all around experience! \n\nI have eaten at many high end steak houses in major cities, such as Charlies in Orlando, Del Friscos and W Steakhouse in Vegas, and The Palm in Dallas.  I have no qualms in saying that the Bone In Ribeye (my staple!) at Maestro's was the best out of all of them!  The steak literally could have doubled as a dessert - it almost had a brown sugar taste to the outer crust while the perfectly cooked medium rare center oozed out delicious juices to mix with my Maestro's Potatos (a highly recommended side that is much more affordable then the Lobster mashed potatoes which I decided to pass on after reading yelp reviews)\n\nThe wife had a filet which was cooked to her liking (but not mine since it was medium well, lol) which she also enjoyed.\n\nLast but not least, I didnt see much about this on Yelp, but do NOT pass up the warm butter cake for dessert.  I am not even a dessert fan and rarely even order it - but the wife was in the mood for something sweet and the waitress recommended this one, which was one of their specialities.  Not only was the warm butter cake delectable, but the bowl of home made whipped cream that came in a HUGE bowl could have stood alone as a worthy entry on the dessert menu. It was like eating ice cream. I shudder to think how many calories were in that dessert but it was totally worth it!\n\nI also give the service 5 stars.  I made a reservation for 7:30pm on a Friday night two days in advance via OpenTable. I did take the Yelp advice and call afterwards to ensure that we were seated in the main dining area (good advice as the bar when you first entered was slightly loud, although not as loud as some reviewers seem to make it out to be).  \n\nWe were seated within 5 minutes of showing up and dined in the Main dining area as requested.  Our server was extremely attentive without being overbearing, made good wine pairing suggestions, and really made the experience worthwhile.\n\nOur bill (1 cocktail, Two steaks, 1 side, 2 glasses of wine, 1 dessert, 2 dessert apertifs plus 25% tip) came out to $230 ... about what I expected and well worth every penny! \n\nLastly, this is a nice establishment and we dressed up - but there were people coming in with shorts, baseball jerseys, etc ..."
0,"If you want to get the squirts, order their frittata (which sucked BTW - bland, very little pesto sauce, veggies, hidden by a mound of bitter greens. I couldn't tell if I was eating a salad on an omelette or the other way around).  The cafe latte was good, but small for a 'regular' sized coffee.  I was hoping to have a filling breakfast, butt, in the next several hours, everything came back out..."
0,"Really not the super store I was expecting. Much smaller than the name suggests and too high for my budget. To give you an idea I was there for hair stuff and hair jewelry was $60 and up. Veils were $120 and up. Got a \""how are you doing\"" from a couple of associates which is enough for me.\n\nThis may be it for some brides but I was able to scan the store in ten minutes. \n\nI ended up DIY'ing my hair accents with Micheal's help for under $10. SAS is a great crafters paradise too. It just wasn't meant to be for a budget bride like myself."
0,"2nd visit to this establishment....ordered the pot roast sandwich.  The bread was dripping in grease.  The \""chunks\"" of pot roast in the sandwich were huge.  too big even for a man.  So I took them out to cut them up. Had to saw thru them with the regular knife,  there was so much fat and gristle,,,eek!  was horrible.  The waitress had no emotions whatsoever,  she never came back to table after we were served.  When she came to bring the check I told her about the pot roast and showed her the huge inedible pieces with fat and gristle.  She grabbed the check off the table and left.  She came back about 5 min. later and \""slapped\"" the check down and walked away, not even a word.  We found that my entree had been removed.  \nAlso.....I will never go back just because of the dirt we noted on the window sills and blinds, they were filthy!!!"
0,"Okay, this is hard for me, but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this. I have always been a fan of Big Wa. I have been eating here for five years, perhaps a bit longer. Today may keep me from going back. The food was great, always is, service was TERRIBLE. The server rushed us out as if our business was not important. Before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said \""Okay\"" and picked up our plates. To be fair, mine was empty, but my fiance and my 2 year old \ndaughters were not. That is totally unacceptable, and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time (around 20 minutes). To take my 2 year olds lunch without asking when we are spending $25 at your establishment is not acceptable."
0,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I saw my watch under my seat and needed to grab it. I was occupied with something else. I ended up forgetting to grab it. At the end of  my car wash I then went to look for it. Management showed me the sign that said they were not responsible and told me to file a report (send to corporate who were not even at the scene). The manager (Jose) said he \""asked\"" everyone about it when I physically saw him only ask two people. This is a terrible establishment and they have now lost a customer for life for their lack of honesty. DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE WITH YOUR BELONGINGS!!"
0,"Well I wish I could say the rest of the reviews here about the delivery experience were incorrect but unfortunately they're not. My store experience with Barbara Walters, yes that's her name, as my sales person she was absolutely wonderful and patient as my husband and I shopped for over 3 hours. In the end I purchased over $7000 of furniture at the Scottsdale location.\n\nMy delivery window today Sunday was from 12 to 6 PM. At 9 AM I received a call from the delivery driver to let me know he was ahead of schedule and would be at the house in 45 minutes to an hour. I was actually okay with this because I'm a huge Chicago fan and the bears are playing the Packers today which for anybody who knows anything about football is a huge deal. With the new delivery time I would miss maybe half the first quarter, that I can handle. So I rushed out of my current home to my New home where the furniture is to be delivered to meet the driver. Well it's now noon and still no driver.\n\nI believe living spaces outsources their furniture delivery. They should seriously consider bringing this in-house even at a higher cost. Because of this experience I will not purchase any more furniture from living spaces. I have a large line of credit and a nearly empty home so this is a loss for them.\n\nThe quickest way to piss off a Chicagoan is to cause them to wait for hours in a home with no television during a Bears Packers game. Once my furniture arrives  I will update the review if I feel any differently. Considering it's now noon and I was called almost 3 hours ago I highly doubt anything will change unless this guy shows up with an iPad with 4G and the game on SundayTicket already streaming."
0,"So glad we purchased a groupon here to try it out. Upon arriving we waited 10 minutes at our table before asking a busser to see who our waitress was supposed to be. \n\nIt seemed 5 different people took care of us, which in some restaurants is called teamwork, here it was disarray. \n\nThe tables were so close in their side room that we felt like we were sharing conversations with people we didn't know. Also, our steaks, while cooked to order, lacked flavor.\n\nOn the good end, we loved the setting. The decorations and mood was nice. The fries were good, the seasonal beer was great (3 dollar draft at happy hour) and the baked potato was outstanding.\n\nWe probably won't be back, but it'd be worth trying if you find the right deal or like their menu options. My hope would be that our service experience was an outlier."
1,What can I say except WOW!!!  A client who is moving out of town and will no longer be bringing her dog to Arizona Pet Resort for Doggie Day Camp brought us pastries from Essence Bakery and Cafe.  They are the best pastries any of us have ever tasted!  Do yourself a favor and head over to this gem of a Cafe.  You won't be sorry unless you get there so late that they are out of pastries!
0,"Meh, I had better services else where.."
1,"Came here with a group of us for work based on a recommendation from another co-worker.  We were not disappointed!  Portion sizes were MASSIVE!  Presentation was great!  Taste was on par!  The prices were really great too...which was a welcome surprise on the Vegas Strip!  We got a tower of Fried Green Tomatoes to share - it was presented over a watermelon in a way I'd never seen before, and obviously fabulous.  The server brought us some biscuits and honey which were warm, fresh and delicious.  I got a burger and it was great.  One of our party got the Fried Chicken - everybody around us ordered it as well, he said it was wonderful.  \n\nEverybody left happy, full and with leftovers.  If you're looking for a hearty meal on the cheap definitely come here!"

1,"It tastes pretty decent for your average Chinese takeout.  I was going to give it 3 stars because the delivery took an hour when my estimated delivery time was for 35 minutes. However, the serving sizes are very large for the very affordable prices! Not to mention the large soup size for only $1.50! For a family of 6 we ordered 4 soups and 4 entrees with plenty of food leftover, thus earning it another star."
0,"0 stars. First of all my friends bought a table with 2 bottles of Grey Goose and a bottle of sky this past Saturday for $1,400 and the service was great until some bachelorette party with 14 girls sat next to us. (I'm sure it was a comped table because I only saw one bottle of sky the whole night) The bouncer was extremely rude, he was a big husky  guy with glasses dark skin tone who kept coming back and forth to our table threatening to kick us out because the bachelorette party was complaining about us, yet wouldn't tell us what they said. \n\nAt one point the bouncer and the manager came to our table and said we had too many people at the table when at max there was 11 people, again we had 3 bottles and the other party had 14 people and 1 bottle. I told them this and they walked away without saying anything. They came back again saying that the bachelorette party was complaining, yet again wouldn't tell us what they were complaining about. My friends always purchase bottle service and we've NEVER received such poor customer service from a club and from bottle service. We were being threatened to get kicked out constantly the whole night. I'm never coming here again and will let all of my friends know and urge them to share this post on their social media accounts to warn others from wasting their hard earned money! Don't buy a table at this club!!! There are so many other clubs in Vegas that offer excellent service, especially for bottle service. Oh and apparently you can't take videos or photos per the bouncer who said it was the club's policy and at one point the bouncer grabbed my hand with my phone and pushed it down in order to stop taking a picture. If a club has this type of policy in effect this just goes to show what they don't want released to the public."
0,"I'm a local so maybe its not appealing to those like me. \n\nCouldn't take the crowdimg, no room to dance anywhere. A bigger guy like me, can be very uncomfortable. \n\nI have XM so the music does nothing to me, but I guess the Top 40 stuff is good for those who don't listen to a lot of music.\n\nSorry, I don't care if its the strip....I cant get with $11.00 watered down cranberry and vodka. You'll never win with that. \n\nMaybe one day there will be a club on the Strip not so pretentious and overhyped."
0,"I hate to review based on one experience but I will not be returning. Maybe if I lived closer, I would give another try. This was not a pleasant chill experience.  We started with the crab won-tons and frankly did not like them, the flavor was as if the cream cheese was left out too long and I hated the addition (even though it was a drop) of sriracha sauce on top. Then the soup, a Thai staple, Tom Yum, the broth tasted like sugar was copiously mixed into it. Too sweet for my palate. For entr\u00e9es we had the basil classic and the sai bai fried rice, both were just very bland nothing to remember . And last but not least I like to rock out with best of them and I admit the music that was playing was aces but way too loud. The service was OK but almost awkward, definitely was missing that certain appeal that can make or break a restaurant.  It seemed like the bar patrons were front center and the restaurant took a back seat but I usually don't go to Thai places to get my drink on. Wished it was better."
1,"Good local owned business, small on the inside but seems to be able to cram a lot of liquor in that store."
0,"Service was absolutely horrible.  A group of women came into the bar on a Saturday night to grab a drink and we were all charged gratuity at the bar!  I've never heard of this before, I think most bars should expect to have separate tabs as you order your drink separately and the time it took to get a drink was beyond lousy."
1,"I've been going to Temple for about a year now. My boyfriend and I frequent this place about once a week for after work drinks and grub. \n\nIf you're a smoker and patio aficionado this place is for you. The patio is large with plenty of seating and even has bags. There are TVs on the patio but you're better off going inside to watch the game since there's a bazillion TVs inside. In the summer they have misters which don't really do much, but they're nice for a quick cool off. In the cooler months they turn on the fire pit. The patio seems to be in some kind of transition right now. Last week there were new round picnic tables intermixed with the old furniture - not pretty but hopefully its temporary. \n\nThere's a wide range in the types of people you'll see here - families with kids seated next to Affliction bro types is not unusual. Really, everyone is welcome. They have a moderate crowd on weekdays and a somewhat larger crowd on the weekends. The only times I've seen it busting was on St. Patrick's Day and for UFC fights.\n\nThey have good selection of beer and wine (pretty pricey) and can mix up all kinds of cocktails. Happy hour specials are great. When you order shots, be sure to specify if you want it chilled or room temp because they will come chilled. (I like my whiskey warm) Unfortunately, despite specifying I've gotten my shots chilled. Which brings me to service...\n\nThe service is spotty, hence the 4 stars. Some nights our drink orders are taken as soon as we sit down, other nights we have to flag someone down. But once you get the server's attention they will continually check up on you and are prompt with the bill. (I HATE sitting around waiting for the bill when I'm ready to leave) With the exception of the shots, they always get your order right.\n\nI've tried a lot of their menu and everything has been good, some things are better than others but I've never had anything inedible.I particularly enjoy the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and French Dip. Their portions are generous (great for splitting!) and they serve tots! Tots people! Crunchy, baby hashbrown, potato goodness! \n\nI'm surprised at the negative reviews since I've always had a pretty good experience there. It's not the be-all, end-all of sports bars but it does the job and get's it done well."
0,"As far as casino hotels go, this one isn't the best and surprisingly the majority of the hooter's girls here aren't even that special or sexy.\n\nI keep coming back for the guaranteed 24/7 $3 blackjack tables that are always fun for me to play at.  I swear I could play for days on end if people don't pry me away."

1,"I feel like I've been transported back to the 90's every time I visit this place, and I love it. I'm pretty sure it's the last video store standing, and I hope it never goes away! They always have everything I'm looking for, new or old, and their \""5 movies, 5 days, $5\"" deal on 1 year+ old movies is a great deal! Everyone who works here is friendly and helpful too. I'm a huge fan of Video Paradise!"
1,"3 words - Chocolate Almond Croissant. Not just chocolate, not just almond but BOTH! Together in an unholy, delicious union! This made my morning a delight. \n\nI went back for lunch the same day and had a wonderful chicken pot pie. It's not the usual huge pot pie you might find in the freezer section; instead it's a smaller, lighter, flakier, tastier version. It's served with a very simple salad of greens lightly dressed with vinaigrette in the French manner.\n\nI liked it because you don't leave feeling like you have a lead brick in your stomach. The best way I could describe it is - elegant comfort food. Now go get one of those croissants! \n\nNote - they are closed on Mondays. Those days I have to make do with a cardboard protein bar. Sigh."
0,"Stayed here two months ago on a get away for my anniversary. My boyfriend and I are not super big partiers but figured an affordable vacation to Vegas to see some shows and have fun was in order. We got to the hotel and it wasn't too far off of the strip which was great. Our room was decent. But we had the strangest thing happen, and were not happy with how it was handled. We picked up some things to drink on the way to the hotel. There's a key to lock your fridge, which we had a bottle of vodka in and some beers and we didn't lock it. We came back to the room on our second day there, after only having two or three drinks out of the bottle, we opened up the fridge to find that it was almost empty. This was after our room had been cleaned. It wasn't like this was expensive alcohol but we decided to let the front desk know. You would think they would want to know if someone that works for them may be drinking on the job or taking anything in general. After we let them know the next time we opened the fridge on the next day (also after housekeeping had come) we noticed the vodka all of a sudden had doubled. We let them know it had been tampered with again and then they sent up a security person to our room. Now, I can understand that 99.9% of the time people probably drink it and forget and complain because it's Vegas...and that happens. But that was not the case, I was that .1%. The response we got from the security guy is that we had drank the alcohol and we just forgot, and he said that multiple times. I did NOT appreciate that. It may be silly but that's telling me I'm a liar. We were not asking for anything free, and I am still un-amused by that response. They offered us a free breakfast after we first had mentioned it to them which was lovely...until we got back later in the day and they had messed with it again.  Had we even the littlest doubt that we may have drank it we would not have been complaining. Maybe you have a housekeeper that likes to drink on the job...ever think about that? Won't be back. All it took was an interest in the issue we were having and not telling us it was our fault and it would've been just fine."
0,"Want to go to a free show?  Honestly, I was asked that at least 50 times in two days.  It was so bad that I had to find a different casino to gamble.  The rooms are alright, but I wasn't planning on being in the room that long anyway.  Food was good at the steak restaurant .  \nCharges for room is misleading.

They made an extra $40 on bogus fees, but lost out on the $1000 I lost at a nearby hotel.\nWon't be going back to what use to be my favorite hotel in Vegas.\n\nPs. Do not do a late check out.  Something like $20, so u think.  Then u get ur bill and see resort fees tagged on.  My previous day room charge was cheaper than My late check out.\nSad things are so corrupt!"
1,"The only place I'll buy my pet supplies from!  I'm always more than happy to buy from local places, but this one has the most friendly, laid-back employees I've ever seen.  They're not even more expensive!"
0,This has been one of the WORST customer service experiences I have ever had. The funniest part is that it was Clean Freaks manager Ross! I have no idea why Clean Freak would ever have Ross deal with customers. My car was wrecked by their store and he had the never to be rude to me about where I wanted MY car to be fixed! I will never go there again and hope people learn from what I have gone through!
1,"I went here during the middle of the day this past weekend, NOT at night, so I can't comment on how it is as a club.  Upon entering we were given a tour of the place, which I recommend to anyone stopping by.  After being awed, we chilled at the outdoor area.\n\nIt was a great place to kick back and chill, and it had a nice view of the strip.  The drink menu was over the top, and one of my friends got really buzzed thanks to the bartender messing up the drink order and making an extra martini (I was surprised that they actually gave the extra drink to us).  However, be sure to watch your tab; they automatically tagged on a 20% tip to my friend's bill without him noticing.\n\nWe weren't here late at night or during any huge games, but I highly recommend it as a stop to kick back and enjoy a few drinks away from the smoke and flashing lights of Vegas.\n\nFor a few moments, at least."
1,Our agency has ordered delivery from this restaurant several times.  The food is always delicious and healthy. We love this place and will keep ordering from there!

1,"Banh Mi - Vietnamese sub sandwiches, via French baguette (yum!)\n\nPlace - small, tight, only two tables for seating area. If you need a place to sit and eat your sandwiches, you can sit on the bench, outside the shop by the non operable water, by the fountain. \n\nFood - the banh mi #11 is good (steam pork meat). This time, I got #12 which is the same as #11, but longer, almost a foot. I normally don't like p\u00e2t\u00e9, but with my Vietnamese sandwich, I had to have with it.  It just enhances the flavor of the sandwich, with their beurre (lard) --yummm!! They do a good job with the sandwiches here, it brings me close to home in Houston. \n\nService - they can be quick as can be. The only gripe I have is that they do not take sugar cane orders, 30 minutes before closing!  I thought they close at 6:30pm, but the hours now is that they close at 6:00pm daily. Cash only, no exceptions -- had to go to an ATM."
0,"I was pretty disappointed in the size of this location. It's super small and had a really small selection compared to other BevMo locations I have visited. It's a shame because the staff wes super friendly and helpful. I may come back just because this is closer to my house then Total Wine, but only if I want something very common."
1,"Come here for a quickly prepared, delicious meal. I've been here a few times, and I am a fan of their pad see ew, curries, and pho. However, I think that while the pho broth has good flavor, it is also heavily garlicky, so I would recommend adding more sriracha or lime juice to counterbalance the flavor if you're not a big fan of garlic. In general, it's not the best Southeast Asian food I've had (I grew up in New York City), but it holds its own. The cons are that the ambiance is lacking and the thai iced tea comes in a bottle instead of being made from scratch.\n\nDaily specials ($4.99 lunch and $5.99 dinner) as of today are:\nMonday - Pad Thai\nTuesday - Fried Rice\nWednesday - Basil Chicken\nThursday - Yellow Curry\nFriday - Pad Ke Mao"
0,I would never buy clothes here but I did try to bring 25 new jerseys here and they said they couldnt take them because they would just get stolen. I paid $100 each and they offered $0. They have one knock-off for $35 on the rack. Not my cup of tea.
0,"We chose to go to Tully's II instead of going to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \""Please Seat Yourself\"".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""All You Can Eat\"" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"", not \""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"" or \""come back and have a meal on us\""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town."
1,"Local friends took us here and given the location we were skeptical.   As others have commented the service was a bit disorganized.  But as an east coast sushi snob the food did not disappoint.   We ordered a range of rolls and sashimi offerings (standard stuff, california, spicy maki, tuna) and a noodle dish and all were above average.  The bill with beers for 4 was around $100.  No one left hungry.  Do not be put off by the strip mall location.  This is the real deal.  By the way I have to wonder about the \""Panda Express\"" review."
1,Smaller portion than it in the town square. More rooming but long wait to get the food

0,"If you didn't tell me this place was not RA sushi I probably wouldn't know the difference.  Moira Sushi is located in Central PHX and not a lot of my friends know about this place.  I thought I stop by to check it out.  The ambience is pretty hip and cool, but besides that the food is okay.  What I do appreciate is they have beer from different Asian countries which is a plus.  Service was good nothing to complain about but nothing to be amazed either.  If you feel thirsty and need to just chill - stop by  for a while.  Enjoy!"
1,"We live down the street from the restaurant. It's one of our usual dinner joints. It is a Mom & Pop place, but food it great. I recommend the \""THIN\"" crust pizza. We usually have the large antipasto salad with house dressing. It feeds 4 people! The garlic bread is the \""BOMB\"". We use the private room, in the back, for all our special occasions, it's perfect!"
0,"I've eaten here three times. The first time, our server didn't know what toro was. Umm... For realzies? Outside of that, service was acceptable. Sushi was okay.\nThe second time, the service was slower than a geriatric slug. It was stupid ridiculous. Sushi was okay.\nThird time, service was acceptable and sushi was okay. Why did I keep going back? The second time, the wait at New Zealand was too long. The third, my friend convinced me to give it one my try. Hmm."
0,"Thought we'd try this place after passing it for years and reading all these glowing yelp reviews....we waited at least 5 minutes after walking in to be acknowledged.  Seemed like forever.  After being seated, it was probably 10 minutes before we were able to make a drink order.  Without a wine list.  There were 2 servers that I saw in the building, that's it.  No manager, no busser, no bartender.  These 2 were working the entire restaurant.  Keeping that in mind, still was disappointing.  Food was good, but very slow coming.  Service was even slower.  We could have come at a bad time, but it was during the dinner hour and there should have been more help.  Wine glass was empty for quite a while, and I had to flag our server down for another.  Didn't feel \""attended to\"" in other words.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as I am in the hospitality business too, but things could have been much better...."
1,"They had me at Jazz flute. The whole newer, nicer waitress doesn't hurt either."
0,"Went for breakfast last weekend - arrived about 10 to a packed restaurant but managed to find a couple of seats at the bar. Ordered some pancakes, the house Ncounter omelet and a couple of drinks from the coffee bar.   We were told by the bartender to go fetch our own silverware and water. Our food arrived prior to our drinks and my omelet was REALLY cold - like I mean the broccoli was still slightly frozen - too bad considering it's their house specialty - the hashbrowns were also undercooked and the cream cheese glob was just overkill on the omelet.  Our coffees finally showed up, bu they must have run short on milk since there was a two inch gap at the top of my cup.  Fortunately, the pancakes were pretty darn good.   Needless to say, we won't be making the drive from Phoenix again any time soon..."
0,"Give me a break Caesars Palace, to charge almost $30 for a Captain n Coke and a vodka club soda? Screw YOU. That is OFFENSIVE. We would have stayed and bought multiple rounds before the show started but instead we left. Getting raped once is enough. So we left and went very early to the shania twain showroom. Bought two more drinks for pretty much the same price. I am all about making money but this is so OFFENSIVE I will never go back to your property."
1,"Sometimes the luck of the Irish in me comes in handy. On my most recent visit to Vegas I stayed, practically for free, at the Hilton Grand Vacations Club because my best friend's folks own a time share here. Thank you to the Myers family, hollah!\n\nThe suites can easily accommodate 2-4 people. They offer a full kitchen, big fridge, dishwasher and washer and dryer. The place is as luxurious or more than my usual favorite hotel, the Venetian. In particular I was crazy for the three nozzled shower wall! The pool is perfect for lounging, but not so perfect for scoping as the crowd was mixed between older timeshare types and random kids like us. One other important thing, even though it's more of a residence than hotel, the employees are very helpful and responsive. A technician fixed an evil beeping noise coming from the kitchen quickly (dishwasher, who'd've thunk?) and the concierge was an angel, guaranteeing entry for three GUYS into Jet after spending an hour on the phone.\n\nThe location is prime, on the strip and within walking distance to Circus Circus or Sahara. This actually comes in handy because cabs rarely show up here, so you're better off taking the 5 minute walk over to Clowns R Us to get a ride to your evening's destination."
1,"These people are great, hard working, and very trust worthy. I would trust them with my house any day."
0,"I dread going to the post office! Especially this location, there is always a line of 10-15 people and this line does not move fast. Be prepared to wait and don't go if you have other things to do. If you have no other option, clear your schedule, wear some comfortable shoes and take your ipod so you don't have to hear all of the ridiculousness going on around you."
1,"Yummy bone marrow, and oysters. Nice classy place, and great service."
0,I read the reviews. Heard good things. Was excited to try it. It was just ok. Wouldn't return. Pretty limited menu. Disappointing selections. Split the chopped salad and Reuben. Meat was very fatty and huge chunks. Hard to eat.
1,We are now addicted to rock fish. The first bite leaves your mouth swimming in a silky fish in a light soy sauce.  Ok so we ate 5 hours ago and are jonesing for more. On a more traditional taste\nChow fun noodles with black beans sauce and beef. Or the salt and pepper pork chops. Wonder how they will reheat!!
1,"Glad to be back in AZ to try some more of the Henry's!\n\nAs I remember it from last school year, the menu isn't exactly kind to the Chinese illiterate (including myself). But ask the servers and they'll be very helpful with ordering your food.\n\nKitchen in the back seems clean, and it's run by real Chinese chefs! I mean, literally, they don't speak much English. That has got to be legit.\n\nFor the price and ambiance of the outdoor-style tents pitched up indoors, I love coming here to gorge on some authentic Chinese food.\n\nBest part-- Opens until very late."
0,"In my opinion, Wolfgang Puck has seriously over-expanded.  I want to try Cut sometime in the future; but the fact that there is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant around almost every corner has made it a very low priority for me.\n\nThis slightly casual offering is located right in the middle of the MGM Grand casino floor.  You can actually see gaming tables and slot machines from your restaurant table (kind of like people watching, gambler watching).\n\nThe restaurant itself is very comfortable.  We went for lunch during a kind of dead period.  I'm not sure if it would be different experience at nighttime when there is more activity.\n\nI went with one of their pasta dishes, which was just okay.  Not horrible, not great.  Someone ordered the crab cakes, which were actually miniature crab cakes (perfect for sharing).  The crab cakes looked better than they tasted.\n\nPrices weren't too high.  All-in-all, you could do worse in Vegas, but this won't be a repeat visit for me in the near future."
0,"My family and I decided to give this place a try, especially seeing what great reviews were said on yelp. We got there during the lunch hour, for a table of 8 we had to wait 45 minutes which was understandable. When we were waiting inside, we noticed the buffet option but opted to order from the menu since the lunch buffet looked basic. When the food arrived, we all agreed that the food was delicious but many other Thai restaurants down the street offer the same great taste for half the price and double the size. Food may be great but their service was horrendous. For a restaurant with such great reviews, I was surprised we had to wait 30 mins for water and made many, many attempts to gather a waiter's attention for our check. Our party left unsatisfied and made a quick stop at Mcdonalds because we were still hungry. Based on price, portion, and service...I wouldn't return or recommend this place which is why I give two stars."
0,"Bottom line: Not every person who speaks French qualifies as a artisan bread maker. If they try to sell the baguette and tarts in Paris,  I'm pretty sure that Parisians would throw the baguette right back at them.\n\nThe \""European Gourmet\"" sign on their window need justifications."
1,"My sister and I ate there on Sunday night.  We had a coupon for a buy one get one free meal (which is always nice).  Neither of us eat much seafood (I know why did we go to a seafood place?? BOGO)  We both had the same thing, the tenderloin.  She had hers well (which is just criminal if you ask me. :) ), and mine was medium rare.  Mine was perfectly cooked.  It had a nice wine reduction that helped up the flavor.  We ordered the risotto because I love it.  I thought it was really well made.  It was cheesy and wonderful.  \n\nOur server, Peggy, was very helpful.  She checked on us frequently but wasn't overly aggressive or anything.  (You know how it is, there's a perfect balance between asking how you are doing enough and just being annoying - she got it right).   She answered my questions about the food.  \n\nAll in all I thought it was a really good meal."
1,"Easy 5 star...here's why :\n\nThe pizza is awesome.  These are huge NY style slices...definitely need to be folded.  Crust is thin and yummy...toppings and sauce are good.\n\nI am a HUGE pizza fan, of all shapes and sizes, and my entire life I've been a pepperoni lover...fan...connoisseur.  But after a visit from Sabatino's, my life has changed LOL.\n\nYou gotta do their sausage topping.  It is amazing!  It is slightly sweet, full of spices and flavor.  This blew away their pep topping, and made the slices.  OMG great!  See if you agree!\n\nThe other reason why this place is an easy 5 star spot....the prices are stupid cheap.\n\nI felt like I was robbing this place.  $7.99 for an AYCE cheese pizza, garlic knots, pasta, and salad?  And no, this isn't some ghetto or nasty buffet style food spot (don't let the \""food showcase\"" scare you away...they don't serve that food to us!).  It is an extra $1 to get toppings, and an extra $2 for any way you want em.  So for $9 we got all this food!  And yes, the AYCE is all day.\n\nSince you already know how good the pizza is, I will fill in the rest.  The knots are pretty good, not mind blowing, but good.  The pasta is ok...but I won't bother with them again.....I have become jaded with excellent pasta from Italian spots in town.  The salads I didn't touch..but the company said they were ok.\n\nThey also have 2 slices + drink for $5.99 or something like that.  These slices are like 4 regular pizza place slices.  \n\nService is also pretty good.  The server was friendly and refilled and requested often enough.\n\nYes, it is worth the drive.  Give it a shot!"
0,"I have literally cried over this meal 3 times in the past 24 hours. Maybe a little dramatic, but I had huge expectations. I may very well be Gordon's biggest fan. When I was planning my October vacation I specifically chose Vegas just so that I could have dinner here! To say that it was a let down is a huge understatement. \n\nWhen we arrived I was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant. It's beautiful! We sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs. I should note that I made reservations several months in advance. They really do fill up, so know that planning well in advance is necessary here. \n\nI knew it would be a long relaxing dinner. I was excited for the whole experience. This was just slow though. We sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approached us. I was dying of thirst! Don't get me wrong, our server was wonderful. I just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours. I was falling asleep at the table. \n\nThe presentation of the steaks is really cool. I've never seen anything like it. My mind was made up months ago though. I knew I was getting his signature beef wellington. It would be a decision I would live to regret. \n\nI started with the onion soup. It was really good, but not hot! I got the feeling it was not served to me right away. It was almost as cool as room temperature. My friends soups/salads were served perfectly though. The salads looked to be the way to go. \n\nThe beef wellington was awful! I ate about 25% of it and then threw in the towel. I guess I'm just not a fan of the baked meat? It was tender but I just couldn't get over the off taste of it. It literally tasted like I came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven. The pastry fell apart and didn't stay on the meat. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be though. I just sat there wishing I had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead. \n\nWe did a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts. Both were good. Those are hard to screw up though. I do regret not trying the Mac and cheese. That sounded good. \n\nI had been looking forward to dessert here for months! Timing was an issue on this one though. By the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed! No joke. I couldn't keep my eyes open. We had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back, but threw in the towel and went to bed. \n\nIn the end I received over a $400 bill for a dinner I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities. At least I have that memory. I won't be making the mistake of ever going back."
1,"This is a neat little place really close to the ASU Tempe Campus. They have several types of modern style ramen. For those who are confused, this is not a place where they serve you instant ramen! This is homemade ramen noodles, good broths, and vegetables, meats, or eggs etc.\n\nThat being said, this place offers a variety of ramen broths as well as other dishes such as Japanese cury and udon. They also offer several appetizers you can find at many other places like gyoza and edamame. As a plus, this place also serves good quality boba and several different Japanese beers and sakes!\n\nIf you are from Japan, this is not the greatest ramen you will ever eat, more an American twist on Japanese ramen. But, for being so close to campus and being so reasonably priced, it's not bad. I find this is more of a comfort food kind of place.\n\nThe environment is casual, definitely geared towards the college students. There are some TVs that usually showcase some sporting event, and the music is upbeat. I go here with my friends all the time and the wait time to receive your food is pretty short, I would estimate ten minutes or less. Overall, I recommend it, it's pretty cheap, about $7 or $8, and I come back often."
0,Meh. Mediocre at best. Service was horrible. It took 20 min to get drinks and then we were asked if we would like to order appetizers.  I may have enjoyed the food but I was turned off by the service.

0,"Extremely disappointed.  The food was not good.  The service on the other hand was very good.  It's just ashame that the food was nowhere near the service.  We will not be back.  A word of advice, if you order the grilled chicken salad,  tell them to put more beans and not to load your plate with lettuce."
1,"What this place does, they do very well! Perhaps I should say he does well. I've been in a few times and each time it's a friendly Italian man. The place is authentic. Like a little piece of Italy. The espresso has a bold and smooth flavor and in just a few ounces - like an espresso in much of Europe. The Gelato is the big feature though. It is so creamy and smooth. It has become my go to cold refreshment."
0,"I have visited this place several times in the past. They have a decent happy hour and daily specials. But after my last visit, I will never be back! \n\nA couple of friends and I stopped in last night for some late night happy hour sushi and drinks. The service in the past has usually not been the best. However, this time our server, Tony, was actually on point.\n\nI ordered my usual Fire Cracker dish and a friend ordered the chicken gizzards. His food was okay but he literally pulled out about half a cup of slivered garlic pieces. WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC!! Mine tasted fine as usual so not too bad there. Our bills were a reasonable price for all we got. So we left fairly happy with our experience. \n\nThe reason I am giving this place only 1 star is because of the torture I went through after getting home from dinner. I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had to deal with in my life. I had to make a trip to urgent care this morning after being glued to the toilet all night! \n\nThanks a lot Saketini!! I won't forget this experience for quite some time."

I do try the different types of eggs benedict though, and today it was salmon.  food is as good as usual, but I need to say the service sucked this morning.  it took 10-15 min before I even had coffee in my cup.  Then i had a meeting at 9am, figured asking for the bill at 8:25 would do it, but with only 15 min left to get to my meeting I brought my credit card up to the front to pay.   A bit disappointing.\n\nTakes Amex."
0,"This place is not what I expected. I expected a hipster bar with a decent selection of beers (it says ales) in a funky but cool building. What I got was an alcoholic bar with a shit selection of drinks and beers, and a bunch of 60 year olds who had been drinking alone since 'Nam ended. \n\nThis place is grimy, dirty, and kind of scary. There were a few charachters who came in through the front door and scared the crap out of everyone. There was a guy smoking in the bar and the bartender didn't ask him to stop. It's just a shit hole."

I don't remember exactly what we or I ordered, but I do remember enjoying the food and having a very tasty dessert. \n\nBeing at the Venetian last Saturday night and preparing myself for a long night of partying, I decided to go ahead and have another fulfilling and delicious meal at the Grand Lux. My friend and I ordered calamari, duck potstickers, and beef and shrimp, and pudding for dessert. The calamari, potstickers, and combo beef & shrimp meal were all good, but as far as the bread pudding goes, I've had better. \n\nThe combination of the good food and an excellent server (sorry don't remember his name, some Filipino guy) made our dinner experience at Grand Lux a memorable one again. I will surely come back next time I'm in Vegas."

A fantastic exhibit. \nPhillip Curtis: Widely influenced by Mr. Gogh (you may know him by Vincent Van...), Curtis' work is laid out, revealing his struggle with colors while painting his amazing segue into more complex strokes.  \nRickie Gonzales: My talented, driven and adorable bf....wide eyed and reeling from the art erupting around him on walls, floors and out of doors. What a lovely afternoon spent with an artist, absorbing art in a museum I had minimal expectations from.\nI would like to dress up the security team a bit from wrinkly, stale, beige polo shirts to black suits perhaps. The gift shop staff, while friendly, could certainly speed up the service a bit. \nBut my love for the Getty, the Walker, the Guggenheim and Met in NYC is open to a friendship with our PAM."
0,"There are much better choices in uptown Charlotte!  Let me start with the good...the front desk staff. The three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. Great customer service!\n\nNow the bad...stains. There is no other way to describe everything in my room. Multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter. The bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that I kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant. Every, yes every, bath towel had a stain (either black or yellow). There was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past. Even the shower curtain was stained. Then there was the hair dryer. It was sooooo sticky that I didn't even want to touch it. It appeared to be covered in about 15 years worth of cheap hairspray. \n\nI can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon, but come on people!  How about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now!  \n\nLet me be clear that I think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given. They just need a better starting product!"
1,Haven't been here in a long time but when we did go it was AWESOME! Fresh Fresh Fresh and TASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait to go back!
1,"I've only eaten here once. I thought the decor could use some improvement. And when the chef came out front to talk to other patrons about how he was going to repaint & spruce the place up, I was glad. He never stopped at our table to say hello or introduce himself even though we were the only other diners in the place. While I found that to be a bit offputting, I'm glad I didn't let it spoil my experience because...\n\nTHE FOOD WAS AMAZING. Gorgeous presentation, amazing flavors, fun textures. Everything was designed to please all of your senses AND make your taste buds come alive. \nMy friends & I did the tasting menu for $89 a person. Two vegetarian & two regular. They brought out a total of 10 courses & I'm not kidding - every single thing was to die for. I'm very picky & wouldn't rave about the food unless it was worthy. The veggie tasting menu looked incredible & I was jealous I didn't get to try some of those options as well!\n\nWe started off the meal with a complimentary glass of lemon seltzer & crushed raspberries - to open up our palates. We also had ordered a few drinks from the bar - which were fabulous. The Ginger Julep was a favorite. The wonderful wait staff then proceeded to bring out our dishes in a perfectly timed fashion. Some of my dishes included lobster & some kind of apple concotion with caviar, beef tartare with kiwi & nuts on top & lettuce cups to wrap them in, crab in a flavorful broth and... ok I really stink at describing the food, lol. I can't remember what everything was but each dish was complex. Masterfully combined flavors, textures & colors. The food was so beautiful, we hardly wanted to eat it (but we did!). I wish I could give more thorough descriptions but it was amazing. We had several dessert courses & the best was a cheesecake \""pudding\"", covered in freshly sliced cherries, a japanese herb whose name escapes me & some edible flowers on top. I could have eaten 10 of those! We were also given homemade chocolate truffles after dinner. \n\nThis is not a place you go to if you want to stuff yourself with typical American fare (not that there's anything wrong with a burger & fries!). You don't go here if you want to spend $10 & do an all-you-can-eat thing. When I see peopel complaining about portion size or price - it's obvious they didn't do any research into this restaurant before choosing to dine here. The food is complex, fun, delicious & truly unique. It's an experience. It's expensive for Pittsburgh but in NYC, a restaurant like this would charge $200+ for the same tasting menu. If you can go here for a romantic night or a special occasion, I simply can't recommend it enough. \nI will be back the next time I have a special occasion to celebrate"
1,"Just plain good.  I stopped in at Ceasars Palace location in the Forum for a quick lunch.  I am addicted to the Iced Mint Green Tea, and usually start with the Tuna Tartare.  For a non-sushi restaurant, it is not surprising to get a bad order of tuna that has been sitting around just a bit too long, but Cheesecake Factory has never let me down.\n\nToday I deviated from my usual Garlic Shrimp Pasta, and tried the Enchiladas.  3 nicely done tortillas filled with chicken, and smothered in melted cheese, with a side of beans and cilantro rice.  Great fuel for the long walking distances in Vegas!"
1,"What a great place! I wasn't sure if I was going to like a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant. I was skeptical. I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised! My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the \""bacon guacamole\"" which was tasty. Next out was \""tempura unagi roll\"" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the \""crispy pork belly roll\"" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the \""Lobster & Crab Dynamite\"" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, \""where the cool people hang out\"" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu."
1,"GREAT PLACE!!!\n\nDidn't have high expectations when I came into this place. Reminded me of se\u00f1or frogs in most Mexican cities. The inside is nice, mix of dive-pub look. After a few pitchers we were shown the upstairs. That's when this place earned 5 stars. Amazing selection of whiskey and beer. Bartender was knowledgable and easy to talk to. I don't like nightclubs so this is more me speed. Check it out"
1,"My buddy showed me this joint, said it was the best around. I have been coming here 2 to 5 times a week since,\n\nThe spring rolls are a very good choice for starters, always fresh and tasty, not thrown together like some places!\n\nThe pho is great! Very tasty broth and an excellent amount of options to go in with it, from chicken to beef this place is great!"
0,"The food is expensive, and the service was mediocre.  It's like going to a mediocre noodle shop in Chinatown, but with (a much) heftier check because of the decor and location."
0,"Intimate restaurant seats about 70. Neat but a bit over priced, steaks were not great, and $70/ person for 2 sodas 1 bottle of average wine with the meal and no desserts. We wouldn't go back."
0,"I wanted to like this place and based on the reviews honestly expected much more. I typically love *authentic* Mexican restaurants because of fresh ingredients and overall experience. I headed into Taqueria Allende for lunch and got their four taco plate; two beef and two shredded beef (maybe I should have diversified a bit). When my tacos came they looked good, were packed with some great looking traditional fixins but unfortunately that's where it ended. The beef tacos had an old musty flavor to them and the beef itself wasn't flavorful (beyond the unpleasant musty flavor) at all and was pretty dry. As for the shredded beef, eh, just as unfortunate tasting. The shredded beef wasn't as dry but the flavor still wasn't cutting it.\n\nMy cousin got the torta which he described as one of the least favorite sandwiches he's had. The beef on the torta was the same as what was in my tacos and didn't have nearly the proper amount of beef compared to the size of the sandwich (waaaaay too much bread, no meat).\n\nAll in all, an upsetting experience. There are bunch of other better restaurants in the area so I'd say try those and drive right past. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I've only had what I've mentioned above. Typically if I'm going to give a place a negative review I at least give it a second shot but honestly couldn't bring myself to go back here when there are so many better options out there."
0,My first...my last...my nothing! Placed order and waited over an hour to be told they lost our ticket and to keep waiting. Five other tables of people who came after us had already ate and left. The server and manager offered to comp our water and iced tea. Ha ha! Really? No thanks. Never again!  What really sucked was that we told the server this was our first time there and was really looking forward to it. Brutal Service!
1,They are at the Fresh 52 markets and make some amazing vegetarian food. We are addicts and need our veggie fix weekly. Besides being amazing chefs they are amazing people.  They are both into Yoga and healthy living as well as a nice dose of Physics. Anyone who knows who Brian Greene is rocks my world.  Some of the small biz in town only use Facebook so here is their page. http://www.facebook.com/vegoutlasvegas?sk=info
0,"I'm giving it a star but really this was as bad as it gets.    Pricey, terrible food and not even worth it on a Groupon.   Beware..."
1,"I love Audra!! Not only does she do an amazing job, but I just love HER! Shes so easy going and funny! Haha! \n\nIve been going to her for many years now and even followed her from her last location. I'm so confident in her work that I don't even care to look in the mirror afterwards. I always know she makes my brows look great! \n\nShe's definitely gained a forever client and friend! Thanks, Audra, for being the best! :D"
0,"I can't rate any lower than this unfortunately. I WILL NEVER rent from THRIFTY ever again. My fianc\u00e9 left his hat in our rental car. Realizing this as soon as we got to the airport, I rush back to the rent a center. Only taking a half hour from when we dropped off the car to getting back there, I talked to the biggest IDIOT, JOSE, who didn't even bother to ask about the hat's description, only the car.\n\nI waited 25 minutes for him to go check the car only for him to come back and ask what color the hat was. After yelling at him, we spoke to a manager who didn't have the key to the lost and found and the person in charge of it just so happened to be in a meeting. What a coincidence. \n\nI made a claim with the place and was told I would get a call the next day. I never did. I called twenty times and left 6 voice messages. Always went straight to voice mail. Why hire people to do a job if they can't even do the simple task of answering a phone. It's obvious that a worker stole it because the cars go straight to cleaning before going out for rent again. A worker even admitted that workers steal phones that customers leave behind. If you don't claim your items after 30 days, they let the workers take what they want. That's what I was told. \n\nThis was a brand new San Francisco hat that is hard to find in the Bay Area where I'm from. DO NOT RENT FROM THEM. Workers are rude and careless and get paid to stand around and pick their ass. Pay the extra money for somewhere else"
0,"Naked Pizza sucks. \n\n1. I called in my order, told them it would be pick up. Went to pick up, they couldn't find order & turns out it was currently being delivered to my home. They were rude & blamed mistake on ME and would not refund any money. They left the pizzas at my home & I got home 8 minutes later to a pizza on the doorstep with a confused delivery girl, asking me to pay (even though it was already paid for). She had to call the store to clear up mistake (meanwhile, it's not 6:40p and my pizza was \""ready for pick up at 6:10p- so it's now cold). She left, we were extremely pissed and Naked did NOTHING to make it better. \n\n2. Opened the now cold pizza. On a large pizza, there were probably 9 pieces of sun dried tomatoes, which looked like it needed at least 30. Obviously, a way to save money. On another pizza the pepperoni created so much grease it looked un-appetizing. \n\n3. Pizza tasted like death. Crust was gross, toppings were burnt, blah. Have you ever eaten a cold naked pizza? Don't. \n\n4. After feeling gross from eating blah tasting pizza & thoroughly pissed off for having a ruined Friday night (should also mention we had friends over for a diamondbacks game- and EVERYONE was disgusted & now HATES naked with a passion) we called Naked. Woman, young manager was extremely rude. After a long (5 minute) phone fight she finally refunded our money. \n\n5. Great marketing idea, but just disgusting. \n\n6. Honestly: dominoes (gross) or pizza hut (sick) or even frozen pizza taste ten times better."
0,"I have been to other GBK locations (London) and was in the mood for a great burger but I was so disappointed! I typically would have given the other location I visited 4 stars so I had expectations. I ordered a buffalo burger. \""Sorry, no buffalo today.\"" So I said I'll take a regular burger with cheddar. Plain. No sauces. No salad. No toppings. And an order of sweet potato fries. \""Sorry, no sweet potato  today\"". Ok, onion rings.\n\nSo I wait for what seems like an eternity for my burger (and the place only has about 4 tables with customers...mid afternoon) and the burger is wrong and the onion rings are burnt. The burger has lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayo and salsa. I send it back and it returns less than a minute later. I asked the waitress if they just scraped off the toppings, to which she answered no but when I lifted the bun, I showed her the remains of the salsa. Walked out without eating lunch. Won't be back to this location."
0,"I went to Caf\u00e9 Salvo with my family while visiting from New York. It looked OK (with reservations) from the outside, and the d\u00e9cor on the walls was charming (but NOT the plastic tablecloths). \n\nThe menu looked OK, but when our food arrived, it was TERRIBLE. The pizza was greasy, my sausage rolls was third-rate, the tomato sauce on the tables came out as pale orange ooze with NO tomato taste, and the cold drinks were tepid. I was laughing even before I'd reached half-way through my meal, knowing already that this would rate as the Worst Caf\u00e9 Experience Ever. We didn't stay for dessert, even though the cakes in the display cakes looked OK. \n\nNOT Recommended!"
0,"Wow... You guys have OFFICIALLY hit a new low! First, you pulled a massively sneaky pete by tricking my fiance into a 2 year contract by offering a $100 promotion (and of course, forgetting to mention that accepting the promotion would mean a contract), then, after visiting the store, and calling several times to speak with your utterly incompetent reps, he finally managed to get the account canceled - double and triple checking that everything was completely paid. Now, mysteriously, several months later, we get a call from a COLLECTIONS agency stating that we owe AT&T money. When we called you guys to find out what the hell was going on - your unfortunate excuses for reps A. Couldn't find the account, and B. Upon finding the account didn't have any good excuses or reasons for not notifying us of an outstanding balance (especially since we made more than enough efforts to make sure that everything was 100% taken care of). Not only did we get a major attitude from not only your reps, but the sassy \""supervisor\"", but now we're also having to deal with some collection agency to get this taken care of. \n\nPLEASE SPARE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH AT&T!!!!"
0,"I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.\n\nBut with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.\n\nI am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /"
1,"The perfect place for day drinking and brunch on a lazy weekend, Maizee's benefits from an ideal location right off the rail and not far from shopping up the Camelback Corridor. Give me a San Tan Devil's Ale on tap and the Tangy Turkey wrap any day of the week. The Ancho Salmon Salad is also the cat's pajamas. \n\nBeyond the reliable food and casual atmosphere, Maizie's delivers on service, which in this town is never a given."
1,"I do like this place they actually make the tortillas and chips there and they dont use hydrogenated oils.\n\nThey use milk in the refried beans instead of oil.\n\nThe one at North is very trippy it has glowing magenta mushrooms on the walls. Very acidy, weird.\n\nI liked the cream cheese burrito thing but I got it not deep fried. \n\nPretty good a bit pricey but the portions are huge so share.\n\nIt truley is family owned my brother is friends with the owners son. I think 2 or three families own it. \n\nIt is the best mexican food I have had soo far.\n\nBut still not amazing"
1,"I really enjoy this location. Service can be hit or miss but I prefer it over all of the other locales.\n\nPros:\nVegetarian friendly\nFood is consistantly delicious \nOutdoor seating, weather permitting\nSpacious with upstairs seating\nClean \n\nCons:\nService (see above)"
1,"This place is a must for tourist and locals alike!  The Fireside Lounge is ideal for playing kissy face on a date night.  If you are bringing the family, then eat in the main dining room.\n\nGreat late night dining!"
1,"Short review for a short visit to the new Casa Reyna restaurant attached to the fantastic grocery store located upstairs/next door. \n\nWe stopped in for some chips, salsa and tacos after a long drive to town and experiencing the Incline. We sat at the bar since it was in between lunch and dinner and no one was really there. The chips and 2 salsas (salsa roja and peanut/guajillo) were pretty awesome. The roja was spicy and fresh and the peanut/guajillo was sweet and savory at the same time and a nice change of pace. The chips were fantastic. Thin, super crispy, practically perfect and made from scratch in house. \n\nThe tacos were solid but inconsistent. The corn tortillas were fresh and tasty and doubled up on each taco. Carnitas was easily the star of the show with plenty of seasoning and properly cooked with slight crisp and very tender meat. The lamb barbacoa was well cooked but didn't offer much in the way of flavor or salt beyond the meat itself. Definitely needed some spice in there. The least successful was the lengua which was unfortunately chewy and lacking the the luscious texture I love in great tongue. \n\nPleasant interior feel, very clean and comfortable. Good overall experience and I'd highly recommend stopping in to give them a shot."
1,"Wahoo!  They have a location in Vegas!!  I used to be a regular in various locations around SoCal... so when a friend mentioned this place recently opening up... I had to pay this place a visit.  Unfortunately it's location is a bit obscure... you wouldn't really run into it randomly unless you live in the area.  Google it and try it out.\n\nI like the fish tacos and the maui bowl... but mix it up and find your favorites, there's plenty to choose from.  If you can't decide, let the bartender or server order for you :)  \n\nThey've got video poker machines at the bar as well as Thirsty Thursdays! (1/2 off draft beers...Sam Adams please.  Always a good choice...)"
0,Nice furniture and a knowledgable friendly sales person but very dishonest delivery information.  When we said yes to the salesman on 5/28 he said they would deliver on 6/8. Seemed like a long time but OK. Then we went to pay and they say they can't deliver until 6/12. 4 days later their customer disservice staff calls to say they won't deliver until 6/18. \n\nWhen I call to complain to the salesman he tells me their prices are sooo low they just can't keep up. We went to Mor and got delivery the next day.
1,"What a great little place this has become! I've stopped in here a handful of times for a few beers and occasionally a bite to eat (they typically have a food truck on Thursday nights). It's a small place but they have a nice bar and some tables and couches to sit on. I've caught the \""house\"" band, Deadman's Banjo, a couple of times too. Lot's of fun. They've got 2 TVs to watch the games and Rob & Joe really know their stuff regarding beer. A nice place to be a regular."
0,"I -had- to try Five Guys tonite, and well....I'm glad I did, for many reasons.\n\nYes, I'm an In-N-Out gal, there's nothing better than a Double-Double, animal style, no tomato and the fries WELL done. HEAVEN.\n\nPros: Five Guys had -one thing I liked: The cajun seasoning for the fries. Mainly hot paprika, and salt, but it was a very enjoyable flavor. It all went downhill from there, sadly.\n\nCons: A -greasy- burger, no matter how much the propaganga on the walls tells you otherwise. (the little reviews/write-up from mags, all along the walls. The one i'm referring to it the article nearest the bathroom.) The meat has very little flavor. The \""juiciness\"" they brag about was just oozy grease, so be warned! The toppings I chose: grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, pickles and mustard. I ordered the bacon cheseburger, for those of you curious. The mushrooms? They use -canned- button mushrooms; those godawful slimy, discusting things with little flavor but of what I like to think of as ASS. A BIIIGGG thumbs-down for using such a gross item; it took away from any potential tastiness of the burger, and I ended picking them all off, after 2 bites.\n\nThe fries: Wow. TOTAL let-down, but for the seasoning. They were soggy, limpy, greasy, PARTIALLY UNCOOKED, and the worst french fries i've EVER had in my life. They also cook them in peanut oil, so they have a unique 'tang' to them that I did not care for in the least.\n\nIn-N-Out has NOTHING to worry about, this place isn't even -close- to being a contender for a good burger joint!"
0,I am only giving two stars because of the actual vet herself. Jade Tenberg was the first vet in four years to spend time talking to us about Gidgets skin condition. That's another story though. We are thankful to her for actually caring about her condition and our talking to us about our options. It is the front desk that is ridiculous and not just one time but every single time I have ever had to call. If you make an appt. I highly recommended calling to confirm what day and time they actually scheduled you for. I would also recommend calling to confirm what they put down for the reason for the visit. So far I have had to correct them almost every single time. The other issue is the check in and check out time. They are sooooo slow and have no idea what they are doing. Bansfield should be embarrassed. As far as the wellness plan it is over priced and a scam. You are better off going to a regular vet not inside of a Petsmart. Today was the final event and I am calling to cancel my plan with them and finding a different vet.
0,My food took 50 minutes to arrive. I was at a table of 2 and it was a Wednesday afternoon. Such terrible service. It even took us a while just to get our table.  When our food came our soup was luke warm and the sandwich wasn't even hot. Honestly. So many better places to go when in the strip. I'm very disappointed in the service and the product. I won't be going again.
1,"The food here is reasonably priced with huge portions that only I seem to finish when I go with my friends. At the one in San Diego, I always got the cheeseburgers, but then I saw Man Vs Food and that \""Andy's Sage Fried Chicken\"" thing is just too good to pass up every time I go now.\n\nBe prepared to wait in line for a long time. Keep in mind there is a casino literally an escalator ride below you and you're in Las Vegas so if you can't keep yourself occupied for 45 minutes, you need more help than a good meal can provide."
1,"First time staying at the Mirage, and I was very happy with the experience.  Awesome pool, cabana at Bare on the first day, ridiculously fun bartenders at Kokomo's every night that kept our party going until (gulp!) 6 in the morning...not to mention Carnegie Deli *right there*.  The RhumBar is killer, and the spa will help you \""detox so you can retox\"" right up there with the best of them...We literally had everything that we needed right inside the hotel, and we appreciated that there was no smell of smoke anywhere we went.  \n\nRooms were comfy, and soundproof! Did not hear any of the outside noise that other yelpers here have complained about.  \n\nPool service was great, though I docked one star for the non-hotel guests that seem to make it in.  Club promoters seem to have no problem, though we can't really complain about the club comps that they provided our group.   Still though, makes you wonder.  With the pool that packed, they would do good to make it a bit more exclusive..."
1,"I am definitely a fan.  Their tacos are big and very tasty.  I really love the steak and the al pastor tacos.  Their meat tastes so good and this is hard to find at most taco shops here in Las Vegas.  With 2 tacos you are good and the tacos are served with beans, cheese, 2 corn tortillas, and if you want at an extra cost, sour cream and guacamole.  It's my favorite taco shop with Tacos el Gordo :)\nThey also have fruit juices that are very good, the mango is delicious."
0,"There are so many \""all you can eat\"" sushi places in town to go somewhere that the service fails. I do like their rolls but whatever, it's all the same rolls wherever you go-rolls with a bunch a different goop slathered all over them in different combinations, I'm not dumb. \nThe guy who works there, the waiter, owner, whatever has the personality of a mackerel!\nThe staff there and at their other location near Rhodes Ranch, have terrible personalities. They do not say thank you when leaving or entering. When I go there I feel like I am intruding on their time. There is a place called Sushi Koma on Flamingo and Durango...I will just drive there next time....(it's farther) but at least, those people appreciate your business.\nNo more Inaka for this girl...and all the people I take. It's not worth it. I go out for the environment as well as the food. I literally left there the last time like I did something bad."
0,"Well, here I am trying to write a review for a pizza THAT STILL ISN'T HERE. Ordered it 90 minutes ago. Calls to the place for the last 45 minutes have received a \""it's on its way\"" remark. I'd LOVE a phone call from the owner giving me a reason to give their business a second chance.\n\nYou know where I live, because you left your door hangers on my property as if to say, \""Here! *you* throw this away instead!\""\n\n\nEDIT- THE PIZZA IS HERE! and it's cold."
0,"See my review under \""dairy villa\"". I will never go to this place again."
1,It's great to walk into a gluten-free establishment with no worries about cross-contamination. So many choices. The lime-banana bread was excellent. Great smoothies too!
0,This particular location was terrible. Half of the menu did not exist and they stopped serving sushi. We walked out. The other location is awesome.
0,I have come here a few times and each time has been hit and miss between items on the menu.\nService was usually decent.\nWait was usually long in the drive-thru.\n\nTonight was the last time though.\nI only went there because I got a coupon here and there.. no more.\nThe dude was rude on the intercom totally rushing me and being annoying.\nI get up there after waiting forever and he only gives me half the discount because he swiped my card before I gave him the coupon. He didn't tell me either he just tried to sneak it. I had already told him when I ordered that I had a coupon and he could have asked a manager for help. He was still rushing me out of there even more since he knew he was being sneaky.\n\nSo my wife got the 5 piece chicken tenders... I only thought it was chicken because it was labeled as such. It smelled like straight up chemicals. It tasted the same. Like urine chemicals........\n\nI wanted to get my money back but didn't want to go in there and I was just over it. I am pissed to have wasted $6 on chemical chicken and the loss of coupon though.\n\nThen I had 10 mins to shop at SuperTarget because Carl's Jr took so long and it was almost 9pm.\n\nDone.
1,"I walk by here too often and love all of the waffles they offer.  \n\nget the waffalonia sometime and add on nutella, ice cream, speculoos spread, whipped cream, strawberries and bananas.  Its best shared with one other person; their waffles are always a pick me up for me."
0,"The only reason this place is getting two stars is for their service.  My boss wanted to order from here last week and their menu was not working online.  I called and asked if they could fax it and their fax machine was also not working.  They had someone deliver a menu to my office (they don't even deliver food).  That's a good start!  Or so I thought.\nNot sure if everyone is drunk when they review this place or what but the food was horrible.  No one in my office was satisfied with their food.  I ordered the Supreme Tostada Nacho and it ended up missing half of the things that are listed as being on it (fried jalapenos, avocado lime salsita, cilantro, etc).  It was some bland beef, bland fake cheese and a little real cheese on top of greasy chips.  Not sure how they can pride themselves on their nachos when I could get better ones from Taco Bell.   Another co-worker got steak street tacos - she said they were bland and nothing to write home about.  The wings were also not very tasty.  \nSo much for a new lunch spot downtown for us...."
0,"How can you screw up on Boned in New York twice? Come to Delmonico's.  Medium means Well Done.  No pink what so ever.  And they even cooked two steaks. \n\nIs your steak fine? After all your friends have eaten? Yes.  It's fine because I don't want to wait around for you to screw up anymore.  \n\nOnly saving grace was the bourbon.  \n\nBasically, screwed up on steak.  Luke warm coffee.  Oh hell, might be a bad night, but my five other friends had good dinners.  Didn't want to bitch and spoil their evening."
1,Really cool place! The bar was as impressive and unique as the drinks it produced. The food was followed suit in creativity and taste. The deconstructed banana split was amazing. I would be happy to return.
0,"The reviews for this place are good. Not sure if we went on a bad night or what. I liked the margarita... But they are very pulpy. Not everyone likes chewing their drink. I had the carne asada burrito. I think it would normally be good, but the meat was too charbroiled and left a burnt taste in my mouth. The chicken enchiladas were very good I was told."
1,"Stayed there for a few days for work and had a great time. \n\nPros - Nice rooms, super friendly staff (except the man in the gift shop who was strange and kind of rude), food was excellent in the restaurant, Starbucks onsite and of course, the outdoor hot tubs.\n\nCons - There's not really much around the resort except for other resorts.\n\nAs I was there for work, I didn't pay for it so couldn't say whether it was good value or not."
0,"When I sat down I noticed my tiny plate had old wasabi crust on it,but no worries I was politely given another one.Well I liked this place because It is a really convenient area. It's a great place to come  after shopping with your friends. The sushi (I think it was called the Mango roll) I got tasted like salsa. the bento boxes are filling and have authentic Japanese flavor. I have had better sushi compared to this place. The only positive thing about this place is the area."
0,"I went to Vegas for a birthday party weekend and some of the girls wanted to get manis/pedis.  The price for a mani/pedi at most spas on the strip is pretty ridiculous, so we decided to try an off-strip place instead.  First, this place said they could take six girls right away when we called but we arrived we had to wait almost 30 minutes for two of us to even be taken (and they only took two of us at a time, so we were there for a very long time).  They only had two other patrons in there at the time but there were a total of four people working, hence our long wait time.  Then, once I finally got seated for my pedi, the person I had barely did anything.  My toenails were clearly not even and I had to tell her to go back and shape them.  I also barely got a foot scrub and massage as she was so busy trying to up-sell me on add-on services.  Next time I will just pay the extra money and go to a nice place on the strip, or get a pedicure at home before heading to Vegas."
0,"Got my nails done here and by the time I got out the door I needed a fill in   What a scam. I went to get my fill the next Saturday and they asked me if I wanted them thick like this again.  Half the time I was getting them put on the guy was watching what was going on behind him.  I went to Dolly's across from sky view high, had them done and it's been a week and they still look great. I think I'll get 3 weeks out of these AND they look totally natural not like little blobs of acrylic on the tips of my nails."
0,"You guys have to be crazy!!!  The point system is ridiculous.  25 points for the lowest level bed, $16 for 25 points, was told the cheapest possible solution for me to get 7 visits on the cheapest bed would be $90!?!?  Are you serious??  Why would you make the lowest level bed 25 points?  This is marketing gone wrong. I called a competitor down the street, $25 for two weeks unlimited.  Rachel H. things sure have changed since your 5 star review."
0,"We were visiting Charlotte for a couple of days and were relying heavily on Yelp to lead the charge for dining - but this time it let us down.  \n\nThe Bad: I'm not sure if we were there on an off night or what (quite possible when looking at photos from other reviewers) - but the food just wasn't good.  Given the reviews - we were very surprised.  We started with cornbread and biscuits for the table - they had little flavor and were so heavy and greasy that when we ordered our meal we said no thanks to the bread option.  I ordered fried chicken w/ mac&chs, butter beans & collards.  The greens were good - but that was pretty much it.  The chicken was dry, the mac&cheese had the same old-oil taste the bread had and the butter beans were okay for being out of a can, but nothing special.  A friend order a Salmon special and she said that was good so I wish I had ordered that instead.  \n\nThe Good:  Service was good.  Attentive and friendly server took care of us.  The premise behind the restaurant is fabulous - giving back to the community.  But I would have rather given my $$ directly to their cause than spent it on the food."
1,Staff was so friendly and they did a great job shaving down my girls. I'm going out of town soon and I think I'll board my dogs here too
0,I will bet my money that the fish is frozen!! It looks like those frozen breaded fish sticks that you get out of the box...remember when you were a kid?\nThe salad was fine but the dressing I swear was the Kraft stuff - which is ok if that's what you want......somehow I was wishing that we stayed home.\nThe quality of the meal was pretty disappointing at best - so I dont remember anything else.
1,"Love this place, great atmosphere, best fish n chips and great happy hour. The vibe is laid back and on the weekends there is live music, great place to grab a beer after work!"
0,"I was pretty disappointed in my visit to the gladly... Definitely a fan of citizens public house, but not so much on the gladly. \n\nI brought my husband here for his birthday about 2 weeks ago, we just moved to the area. I ordered the filet and he had the pork chop. Standard cinnamon-y/ apple flavor really not impressive. My steak was over cooked, the flavor was alright.... For the price of the meal, there are so many better options in the area. It was truly a let down, cph is sooooooo good!"
0,"It's not bad, but there is nothing that stands out, either. Breakfast was fine, but expensive. Service was fine. It's okay if you are staying in the hotel, but 100% NOT worth a special trip."
1,Our house loves Paradise Bakery but over the years we've found out that they aren't that consistent with their food. We go to two locations either this one or the one in Chandler Fashion Center. We've found out that the ones in the malls just don't have the exceptional food like the ones that are outside of the malls. \n\nIf you grab the paradise pasta salad from the mall even though it's good they don't put the added touch of shredded cheese on the salad BUT if you go to a store that's not in the mall they add shredded cheese on top of the paradise salad which all in all makes it better. I just wish that their food was the same from location to location.
0,"Very disappointing stay.  After a very slow and sloppy check-in process (e.g., she wrote my rate in the key sleeve rather than my room number) I went to my room where I discovered they were assigning me a \""roommate\"".  In other words, the room they gave me was still occupied and someone was actually in the room.  So I had to go back to the front desk for a new room.  When I told her what happened she asked \""are you sure\""...?  Room itself was fine.  However, the bathroom had a smell that immediately brought me back to the boys locker room in high school...a smell I never thought I would be exposed to again.\nBreakfast this morning was another folly.  The restaurant posted it opens at 6:30 am.  At that time there were 7-8 hotel guests circling like vultures waiting to be seated.  The hostess would not seat us until she counted her bank and got her station ready.  So we waited 10 minutes for her to count her pennies...\n\nManagement needs to look in the mirror and get their act together."
0,"So extremely disappointed. My mother booked two nights at the Stratosphere for a much needed couples week-end with my husband. She used Expedia. Cus we Expedia the Stratosphere kept telling us we booked with a third party and to work details out with them. Expedia said to call hotel and request room type and preferences. When I did I was told hotel did not have our reservation from Expedia yet and call back day before.  When I called a day before I was told rudely we were in the \""old un remodeled part of the tower in two queen bed and it was to late to make changes\"". Once we got there we did get one queen bed but very far from the pool and with a horrible view of the rooftop of another building and depressing North Las Vegas. We ate diner at Mac gross -the most pathetic attempt at a steak house. Gross. The pool closes at 7. There is only ONE POOL and it's full of kids in clothes. Sunday we slept in. Skipped brunch an decided to have dinner in the tower at 11:00pm. Everything was closed (with exception of the diner) club 107 had only 4 appetizers available out of the entire menu. None appetizing. By the way... We had to pay $15  per person per day to. Use the facilities as a guest of the hotel! WTF?! That was $90 extra for a gross kid filled jacuzzi and a pool that closed at 7! A restaurant that closed too early to enjoy and a stinky old room with a debtor easing view. No wonder 7 people have committed suicide here! We should have stayed in Laughlin!"
0,"The food is So So, but my husband and a coworker got the Oysters to start with  and the two of them ended up with food poisoning!  \n\nThe vegetarain options on their set menu are not great.  Their risotto was not cooked enough, i know risotto is supposed to have bite, but this was ridiculous i was chewing forever!  \n\nThis year i told the company not to bring us back here! Maybe I will go to Sirio instead... so much better!"
0,"I am actually writing this review having gotten off the plane after travelling for 12 hours (when the flight should've been more than half that time) on my first and only encounter with Spirit Airlines. I totally regret not having read the reviews before booking my flight - cheap fares are definitely too good to be true with this airline.\n\nEmbarked on a flight from Las Vegas to La Guardia (NYC) airport, via stopover in Detroit.\n\nFound out a few hours before my flight departed that there was a charge for carry-on and check-in luggage - $100 at the gate if you don't buy it beforehand! Daylight robbery. So I paid $40 for my carry-on, but when I arrived at the airport asked if this could be refunded as my luggage fit inside the 'test' compartment at check-in. The service attendant basically waved me away and told me I'd have to pay as it was 'outside the dimensions'. Whatever. \n\nDeparture time was 8.12am. After arriving at the airport 2 hours before the flight departure time, and upon arrival at the gate we were told that the flight was potentially overbooked and that they were seeking volunteers to take a later flight. This was the first scare. However the flight ended up departing approximately on time. Too good to be true? Read on.\n\nArrived in Detroit for a 'brief' stopover. Original time of departure was meant to be 4pm. Passengers were told nothing and it was only until I checked the departure screen that there was now a 2 hour delay, scheduled for 6pm! Went back to the lounge and then was told that the flight would be departing at 5.15pm - no reason was given for the delay.\n\nAll passengers boarded for an anticipated 5.15pm departure. It was only when we were all seated and waiting in the tarmac that the captain decided to tell us that La Guardia airport was closed due to bad weather in NYC. Funny though, that a fellow passenger called out that her friend was departing on a Delta plane at the same time and on the same flight leg, yet her flight was not delayed? The attendant did not seem to know how to respond to this. She called the captain and the captain's best line was that the weather was bad and was causing delays everywhere. Not sure if this was true but after reading MANY negative reviews about Spirit on Yelp, it seems that this is not the first time they have acted dishonestly and used the weather as an excuse for their sloppy practices.\n\nTo top this off, we were then told we could not disembark the plane (since we didn't know if our flight would actually depart due to the so-called weather problems in NYC) and if we chose to do so, would not be able to re-board! The attendant also let us know that Spirit would not be giving out free snacks or water for the delay, and that they would have to 'seek permission from the company first.' What the hell!? This was now beyond a joke. In my entire experience of flying, I have never encountered such unprofessional level of service by an airline. I don't understand how this company is still in business! \n\nAfter waiting on the tarmac, we finally found out at 6.30pm we were able to fly. We landed in NYC at 8.15pm, nearly 3 hours later than the original arrival time of 5.45pm. \n\nIf we really want to stop this airline running altogether, I'd suggest lodging a complain with DOT. I even Googled it and there's an actual website on how to shut down Spirit Airlines!! Check here: http://www.spiritairlinesfacts.com/how-to-shut-down-spirit.html\n\nNever flying this airline again!"
1,"The rolled chicken quesidlia is epic good, almost too much to eat in one setting."
1,Awesome Monte Cristo! Staff is super friendly. Yoli's Cafe is so good that I had to make a yelp account just to write a review and recommend it. 5 stars all around.
1,"The best, fresh donuts ever.  Heaven in your mouth.  Soft, delicate, sugary sweet glaze. Never shall u eat Dunkin donuts again."
0,"The technicians do a good job, but the customer service is poor. Appointment times are not kept and though they advertise walk-in service, they aren't appreciative of them as they will make a walk-in wait much longer than estimated & are dismissive to them. Too bad, great location & fairly nice salon."
0,Much like a cattle drive....they charge a ridiculous fee to have ur flight changed...only fly when i need to. Customer service was not helpful.
1,"AMAZING!! Came here for lunch around 3pm during the week. Great timing, no wait and was seated at the counter that looks into the kitchen. Very tiny place but so good it doesn't matter. My girlfriend and I started with tempura green beans and crispy chicken skins!! Both SOO good it looked like a lot but we ended up finishing it all. For our main course we got a NY steak and a burger. Sounds pretty simple but the was it was prepared was awesome! Our seats allowed us to talk to one of the cooks so it made the experience pretty cool. We ended up leaving only paying $25 each since we split it. Only $50 for all that food! I left full and my wallet was happy as well. I will be back to try the thee awesome things on the menu."
1,Nice place to hangout with gf :)
0,"People keep saying how this place has the best burgers. Well not so for veggie burgers. Seriously, Denny's veggie burger is better. The patty was dry bland mush."
0,"VERY poor customer service, Only reason i am using them and stuck using them is the fact that it is very close to my house and it was such short notice that i needed one, prior to renting my unit I tried to go there twice, both times they were on lunch break, a third time i went there and they were closed (even though their hours online said they should of been opened) and I had to do it through the kiosk which the people i spoke too were not very helpful at all, \n\nSo I get in, and I'm about to move my stuff when the storage unit I had just rented already has a lock on it and is rented apparently, I took it upon my own hands to take the one that was next too it being there was no lock and nothing in there, they still have not fixed it on my account after, calling them and letting them know they've messed up and need to fix my number so they don't screw me over, just emailed them about it again, \n\nThrough out all the problems, the worst was the fact that since i reserved the unit online there was a promotion first 3 months would be 50% off (which is why i did not want to get the unit via kiosk because they wouldn't honor it) the property manager Christine said she would give me first month free and second 50% off, basically ripping me off because the first month is free for everyon"
0,"We have been eating at Monti's since the late '60s, often walking to an ASU football game following our meal. Back in those days, you could count on good service by experienced people and quality food. We don't understand why that has all changed. Rather than older staff who knew their craft, many of the servers are young and seemingly untrained. After a less-than-great dining experience two months ago, we went again last night, to give Mont's another chance. The young woman did not understand our drink order, our meat was tough and not cooked to order. The veggies were very good and people stopped by often to ask how we were doing, but for the price of a steak these days, I expect more than a perky waitress and a historical landmark."
1,Food was absolutely amazing! So glad we stumbled on this little gem! Hubs got the corned beef hash and I got the huevos a madrid (with shrimp and salmon)... Absolutely delicious! Also got a warm welcome from who I assume is the owner. He had great recommendations on what to try. And drip coffee was an awesome locally sold bean. Definitely recommend!!
1,"Rebe Homes team was a godsend when I needed to short sell my house during my divorce. They linked me with both legal and tax experts and educated me throughout the entire process. During the 13-month process Beth Rebenstorf kept me informed regularly as the team jumped through endless hoops and navigated the bureaucratic red tape. It was an arduous process but the Rebe Home team made it as painless as possible for me during this major life change. I've bought and sold at last six homes over the years and this was by far the most comfortable transaction, despite it occurring during a major upheaval in my life. Beth and Rebe Homes are professional, experienced and dedicated to their clients. They always put my needs first regardless of the bottom line. Beth and Rebe Homes went above and beyond traditional real estate consultants to successfully close the short sale of my home in Laveen. I'm eternally grateful to Beth and Rebe Homes for achieving success in a situation I thought was impossible. The next time I plan to buy or sell a home, Rebe Homes will be the first call I make!"
1,I frequent here from LA about 6 times a year and I was happy to find a good Korean restraunt in Matthews.  I love their spicy noodle seafood soup. Must try.
0,"I expected this to be good because their regular restaurant in Scottsdale is good.  It was early morning so the Irish Oats sounded good.  Not sure what is Irish about them (I was expecting Irish Steel cut) as they really seem like normal Quaker Oats and definitely were not Irish Steel Cut).  They were severely undercooked, and barely warm.  The wait staff was quite friendly and helpful and immediately offered to replace the item with something else, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one.  So the repacement was eggs, bacon and potatoes.  The dish seemed like it had been prepared well in advance and had just been sitting.  It was not very appetizing.  I gave two stars instead of 1 because they tried to make it right and I appreciate that.  Perhaps translsating from an upscale restaurant to an airport concession is not easy.  Not sure."
0,"Horrible - absolute crooks in the service dept.\n\nAsked my wife to take our hybrid in for an oil change.  She had a coupon, but they said the 0W20 that the car takes is a \""bit\"" more expensive.  To the tune of the oil change costing 65 dollars after they had already done the service.  The car doesn't even take a full 4 quarts and they are using that basic honda filter.  \n\nHow do these clowns sleep at night?"
0,"So this place was a BUST! I guess after the Pinball Hall of Fame, my expectations were too high, and if you have ever been to the Pinball Hall of fame, although awesome, that's not saying a whole lot! The games were nothing special and the whole place seemed like a huge waste of space. They have it set up to look sort of like a club and a bad one at that! Half of the place taken up with giant booths for bottle service, except no one was getting bottle service and then there is an empty dance floor. Making it even worse, it was a Saturday and they weren't even trying to rev up the place! Of course it would't have really mattered what they did, because the people that came there to play video games, were there to do just that! They weren't there to get down on the dance floor or to get bottle service! \n\nStick to the Pinball Hall of Fame! At least all that money goes to charity"
0,"Nice ambiance. Waited 30 min for table...no worries for Friday night and no reservations. Saw waited twice...asst manager stood in as \""waitress\"". Ordered baby back ribs for a child and an adult, both plates came out cold.\nReally only saw waiter!!"
0,"I went in hurr and i was like, i am going ti get myself some nuggets. Ya girl gotta have nuggets and fries. The service was slow because there be a lotta people. The lady gave asked me what kinda sauce i wanted and i say \""sweet & sour\"" snd she say \""k\"". So i went in mah car and i ate. And i say that the nuggets were soggy and bland , the sauce tastes bad and the fries were nashty because they were also soggy and bland."
1,"This is a very cute shop stocking plenty of Russian dolls, charms, key rings and other Russian themed gifts. The shop is very well organised and everything inside is very sparkly and a little bit different to usual gift shops.\n\nMy mum really likes Russian Dolls and there were a few in here that really caught my eye. The dolls on offer vary in size and you can get dolls as small as keyrings right up to large focal point pieces. I got a really cute plastic Russian doll last year called Barbara, she's super cute and although designed for babies puts a huge smile on my face whenever I see her wobbling about. I was a little disappointed that these cute dolls weren't on offer here but I guess they focus on the more traditional Russian gifts.\n\nIn addition to Russian dolls there's also jewellery and Faberge style eggs on offer too."
1,"This is the best Mexican food on this side of town.  The Pescado Eufimio Zapata has a wine based sauce, with Spanish olives, that is the best I've ever had.  They also have decent priced lunch specials on weekdays."
1,"So far this has been my go to for all things eggalicious.\nThe food is fresh and tasty and the service is pretty consistent.\n\nI highly recommend the \""La Casa Potencia\""  which is a protein packed dream.\nGrilled chicken, egg whites, fresh veggies and beans on the side.  Tortilla too if you're a wheat-eater.\n\nI just moved to Phoenix a few weeks ago, and I have been here at least twice a week.\n\nI should probably order something different next time!!"
1,"My visit was only for the front counter where they have the different food, etc that you order, basically the deli area. A lot of exotic selections and basic stuff like pizza too. It was crowded because Sundays are when the students get their food for the week from here. The prices for the deli were decent. Had the shish taouk for less than 5 bucks and it wasn't bad!"
1,"I called Affordable German today to get some info. I work on my own car typically, but I was having a coolant leak and asked these guys for advice. They gave me expert advice and told me what was needed, and quoted me for the service if I couldn't handle it. Thanks guys!!"
0,"Only once. Never again. Although the food tasted great, I waited 45 min after my entire family finished their meals. The waitress even took their plates before I ate. When my dish finally arrived it took all of 10 seconds to finish. Smallest most expensive dinner I have ever had."
0,"My fiancee and I stayed at HRH last May. We were pretty stoked since we were coming from a fresh, long winter in Montana and were looking forward to some R&R. However, customer service here does not allow for R&R. For some reason the phone became this insane issue on their part, the pools were randomly closed at the discretion of whomever. The people working in HRH are clearly annoyed by the people who frequent the resort because getting help was an issue. Overall, we will give it a 2 star because we liked the rooms and the pools (that were open). However at this point in our life, saving a few bucks is not worth the commute back and forth to the Strip, customer service was hardly good, plus the crowd is much better at several spots we found during our trip - clearly, our next time will be best spent elsewhere and this June we are headed to the Cosmopolitan. HRH failed to live up to the hype and we recognize this."
0,"Yeah sorry guys this place is not cool enough to charge a cover even on weekends. I only went in cause a friend insisted it was the place to be, not the case. Expensive watery drinks and so smokey you could hardly breath. Stayed for two drinks then went next store to the piano bar and had a blast there. I guess some people like these little divey arts/trash/hipster scene but just not my thing."
1,FREE UFC.\nAbove average bar food.\nSpeedy service.\nIdeal layout for starring endlessly at favorite sporting event on TV.
0,"The good:  Hostess was sweet, busgirl was on her game, people watching from the bistro table outside the door to the restaurant while eating was fun.  Side dishes and drinks were decent.\n\nThe bad:  Waiter was half-attentive, my prime rib was entirely too large a cut and I swear mooed as it was set on the table, my honey said the NY strip was \""the worst steak I've ever had in my life\"" - he didn't even eat half of it, it was that bad.\n\nThe ugly:  The price.  Over $200 w/o tip for us to eat steak there that neither of us could palate.  We had been warned by an employee not to bother to eat here.  We should have listened.\n\nSummary:  Wouldn't go there again.  Why pay high-end steakhouse prices for inedible food and a waiter that could care if you have a drink or not?"
1,"Yes, this place is super cool.  Super tiny; but super cool.  Try not to go with a large group or the seating will be awkward.  Their menu is really awesome -- more a lunch-type menu with sandwiches and soups.  If I remember correctly, they had a seafood soup that was only served on Fridays and it was delicious!\n\nYou can get a really decent meal with smoothie and all for around $10.  Their servers are cool and the decor is so very Montreal."
1,This place is amazing! They have the best acai and pitaya bowls in town. Their servings are very generous compared to most places and they have great service. Try this place and you won't be disappointed.
0,"We just moved here from the Midwest and have been staying with my daughter in her apartment in Mesa while we wait to move into our house. I was recommend by a friend who knew the receptionist that worked there. \n\nWe have a 21 month old pure bred collie who just had all his shots before we came to this area! He caught a virus from the dog park at the apartment complex. They never called me back with his fecal exam test results! I paid at the time of our dogs appoint for prescription dog food and two prescriptions for him. I got for prescription at the appointment. They said they would call me when the prescription dog food and the second prescription came into their office for me to come and pick up. They never called! I called. I went and picked up the dog food. Five days later the second RX still never came in and still no phone calls from them even though I was calling them . Finally, I called and asked for my money back from the second RX that I never received. They even sent me a postcard saying my collie need his shots after I gave them his records from our vet back home. We found another Vet in Chandler who we are much happier with who calls us back, has the prescriptions in stock. Gilbert Veterninary Hospital called me and wanted to know if I had requested them to get my pets records from their clinic. I just told them yes? You would think they would get a clue on how they treated me and my pet! Some people really treat their animals as part of their families and you don't take their care lightly! I'm glad this wasn't a child but it was my child with four furry paws! I think that are out just to make money here and just want to rack on the charges! The other vet also told me my Rocky could keep getting this and told me how to prevent it. Where Gilbert was telling me if it happened again that it would require additional testing and was probably colitis! I found out the virus was going around between the other dogs in the apartment complex!"
0,"If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would. There was no line or cover and I now know why. I was out with a group of girlfriends for a girls weekend and wanted to find fun nightlife. Landed at this place and AWEFUL doesn't begin to describe it. They bump loud dance music with no dance floor and have incredibly rude staff. Waited 20 minutes at the bar to be passed up for drinks by the same bartenders multiple times with no acknowledgement. When I stepped in to flag down the bartender after waiting for so long, she gave me a rude glance and continued to pass me and others by. Extremely disappointed - spend your time and money elsewhere and save yourself the trouble!!"
0,"Jason was great - drove all the way from the valley to N Central, Phoenix 2 times and we learned so much from him.  He's the only pest guy I'd ever used.  The treatments worked too.  \n\nNow I've moved out near where his business is located (E Mesa - same ZIP CODE even) and he won't return my calls.  Got too big for his britches, I guess.  Wish I hadn't talked him up to my friends and family - its embarrassing when he doesn't return their calls either."
0,"The worst club I've been to in Vegas. I've been to Rain, Moon/Playboy, Ghostbar, Tao, Tryst, XS, JET, Pure, Tangerine. Prive is by far the worst.\n\nThe bouncers are extremely sketchy. We were first in the general admission line and they moved our group out of the line into a different line for no reason. They said this line wasnt being used that night, yet they let everyone behind us stay in the line (probably because we were a group of 6 guys).\n\nWe wait 45 minutes total to pay a $30 cover charge only to enter the club and see it ENTIRELY empty. The DJ was playing very cookie cutter playlists- nothing even remotely original or cool at all. \n\nSo we wanted to leave and come back given that re-entry is a pretty standard thing in all vegas clubs. However, not for Prive. Prive decided there's NO RE-ENTRY. So unless we wanted to scrap the club idea for the night, we were stuck there. \n\nWe tried to embrace it for a bit. But theres no clear cut dance floor. The area that would in other clubs be the walkway to the bathroom was in Prive the dance floor. And did I mention there's NO RE-ENTRY. \n\nWe left and had far more fun drinking in our room and gambling with the english deficient Pai Gao dealer. \n\nBottom Line...Stay away from Prive. If you want a good club experience, I highly recommend XS, Tryst, or Pure."
1,"This is a nicely appointed, well maintained and clean spa. The men's facilities are on the small size...when compared to the spas at Bellagio, Mandalay or Cesar's Palace. But it's sufficient. Actually nice if you just want to relax and be alone. \n\nI had a massage and gents facial- both very good actually. Prices are on the high end but normal for Vegas strip hotel spas.  \n\nThis is a nice place for sure. Just sleepy."
1,"I hired Brianna to do hair and makeup for me, my mom, and my six bridesmaids for my September 2012 wedding.  Brianna was very professional and accommodating given the number of women she had to prepare in a short time frame, and definitely remained calm under pressure.  I did a hair and makeup trial with Brianna a couple of months prior to the big day, and in between the trial and the wedding date, I completely changed my mind as to how I wanted my hair and makeup.  No problem for Brianna!  She was very understanding, and based on the trial, I completely trusted her to do a great job executing my new vision.  I love, love, LOVED my hair for the wedding, and I was most impressed by the makeup she did for each girl and my mom.  She was able to work with each to achieve the looks they wanted, while still maintaining consistency across the whole group.  The pictures turned out fabulous!  I highly recommend Brianna to other brides!"
0,"Awful just awful, I gave them my car Thursday night at 4, I was informed a part needed ordered they would call me when finished, I called them the following Wednesday confused on why it was taking so long, I was informed it was done Friday and he thought he called me to tell me, I will not be going back, just crap service!!"
0,"Crowded, mashups, girls all wearing the same clothes, horrible booze (like poison-you horrible), $12 drinks, $450 bottles. Not my scene but the club was pretty/well appointed. Many floors. Might be someone else's idea of a fun night, but it definitely wasn't mine."

0,"This place isn't my kind of place, it's a little ghetto... LOOOOTS of super sweaty people, its hard to go anywhere without getting my feet stepped on. We stopped here during our club crawl. Bathroom smelled like really gross cigarettes. Not a quite corner anywhere in case you lose a friend :-( The dancers they hired don't really dance, they just move slowly in poses or fan themselves, it's odd. We had free champagne at the bar but it wasn't very good. Creepy creeps follow you around here :-/ I think my friends had fun here, but this is where we got separated and our search for one girl in our party started."
0,"The players club change their rules when they feel like it. It's funny how I receive an email for \""new member promotions\"" on the 27, it's good for 7 days, I go in on the 2nd and they say it's when they \""sent it\"" not when you receive it. They do nothing to rectify the situation and don't give a shit. I'll take my presidential status elsewhere.  Ridiculous."
1,"This is a Great Neighborhood Hangout. Came here multiple times for business functions and the service has always been top notch. Customer service is Great and the menu selection is GOOD. I came in on a friday for lunch with my wife and kids and they loved the place, truly a neighborhood hangout whether you are with friends for a good beer, burger and music, co-workers, a function or with your family.  Thanks Naber's for always going the extra mile with Great Customer Service.\n\n                                                                                                 - Anthony with Mava Consulting"
1,"I came to 8 1/2 & Piranha to start the festivities for my birthday weekend Friday August 23rd. It was a good decision! The draw for my friends and I was the $20 all you can drink offer I recevied via text message. Great way to get the best bang for our buck. We recieved a plastic cup and a bracelet for our drinks. I had no clue that I was suppose to keep the cup and threw it away after my first drink. The bartender gave me a new one and told me to hang on to it because they reuse it for the drink special. Ok cool. My friend was not so lucky. He was told that he was going to be charged for a full priced drink because he didn't have the cup to refill. Kind of lame and frat boy partyish. My friend found a cup and all was well. The staff, one bartender, on each side of the bar seemed totally overwhelmed and not over friendly but not super rude. Just meh I guess. The rest of the staff was amazing. The drag performers shut it down. Pleasent surprise. I was brought out for my birthday by the queen and given a shot. Hells yes. The dj was amazing. We danced our asses off. Twerk They played some great mixes. Perfect. I don't remember wanting to stop because the music sucked so props to the djs. Overall, I was happy with my choice to come here. The crowd was cool, not that it mattered, because we owned the dancefloor, LOL. The decor was cool. Laidback and chill. We wore shorts and did not feel out of place. Major props for drink special, dj's, and the drag performers. Minus for the bartender being meh. Minus for the bartender's bangs. lmao. But I would reccomend this place for sure. Oh yeah, security staff were friendly too. I hate when clubs hire dicks for security."
0,"It was our first time there. The service was great at first and then it got worse as the night went on. Our drinks and appetizer came out pretty quickly but we had to wait at least 45 mins for our entrees to be served. We should had said something when the people at the table next to us sat down and got their food before we did. When our food finally arrived it was lukewarm. We ate a few bites and took it home to heat it up. We told the server about it and she didnt say much about it and just said she was sorry.  The sad part about it ! It was our 33rd Anniversary.  The food was tasty but cold. I might give it another try, maybe happy hour would be good. Very Disappointed!"
0,"All things outdated & in need of renovations. The casino/lobby/hotel was empty! It also had a funny smell to it. The shops on the lower level were just as empty and some store fronts did not have any businesses occupying them. In one of the gift shops, the saleswoman was beyond annoying. Once you looked at something, she proceeded to tell you the price, even though it was already marked or had a sign hanging. She tried to make small talk, but really only took minutes off my life. If the prices weren't so cheap, I would've walked out sooner. Maybe she is part of the reason no one was in the store, they're too busy running away. The pyramid lights up at night, which is neat, but that's the only thing it has going for this hotel."
0,"What the hell?  I have never experienced a restaurant go down the toilet so fast.  Its like a bad night in mexico.  Service sucked, but the food sucked more.  if by chance you want the blandest food this side of england, this place is for you, but if you want any form of mexican fare, you'd be better off going to taco smell, and I am no fan of fast food, whether it be from north of the border or farther north of the border.  I used to be a big fan of the Aunt, but I can confidently say I will never, ever give this place another try, it was really that bad."
0,"This is very unusual for me to not like a restaurant this much, I swear!  However this was such a disappointment, that it will be some time before I feel the need to go try another restaurant at Aria.  Especially since this the second time dinning there and both places have been mediocre at best.\nI will take some of the responsibility though, for having a bad experience, because we we're in a rush to get something to eat before Viva Elvis.  I had quickly searched before we left the house just to get an idea of what type of restaurants there was to choose from.  Being that me and my fianc\u00e9 visit Thailand at least once, every year, we really love Thai food.  Therefore, I was excited to try this place, eager to replace my last memory of the English pub that wasn't exactly delicious.  \nWe started off on a bad foot, I admit, by being in such a hurry and it only got worse from there.  I had to basically argue with the waitress on how spicy I wanted my food.  I know I'm a round eye, but what kind of scale goes from 1-10 with 2-3 being medium, huh?  We always order around a level 7 at all our neighborhood Thai places and it comes out perfect.  So after a few minutes of bantering back and forth with the waitress, I finally get to a level 5 on our papaya salad and curry.   \nWhen I ordered peppermint hot tea with the food, instead of earlier when she came for the drink order, the look I received spelled trouble.  They served green tea, instead of peppermint, and then it took quite awhile to finally wave someone down so I could get it fixed.  Then the food came out.....Ugh!\nThe papaya salad was seriously the worst I have ever had!  Not spicy at all and seemed to be missing an ingredient.  The curry was also very bland and thank goodness I decided we need some veggies at the last minute because they were really the only good thing we ordered.    The street vendors in Thailand could definitely teach these cooks a thing or two.  \nLike I said, I hate focusing on the negative, but save your money and go to a small neighborhood Thai place like Jasmine or Archie's, where the food will be authentic and the service friendly!"
0,"First let me say I am in the restaurant business. That being said I HATE to give poor reviews. In this case I have no choice.\nWhen i first walked in I thought : GENERIC Bennigans. Those of you old enough to remember Bennigans restaurants will understand.\n\nTHE SERVICE\n\nSara our server was good. She was very polite and genuine. I appreciated her service. She was the only bright spot.\n\nTHE FOOD \n\nGENERIC, lower quality,  I completely understand that the franchisees in these types of business have zero to next to zero input as far as suppliers and food quality. They are buying a cookie cutter type operation with brand standards and operations set in stone. It takes an act of congress to create any real substantial change. This is NOT a reflection of the franchisee who I do not know. The food was lower quality product to start with so how much can they really do with it. The presentation was ho hum at best.  I can not stress enough the GENERICness of the food. The food was a total dissapointment.\n\nTHE AMBIENCE\n\nMisses totally ! A trip to Wal-Mart and you could buy 90% of the decor. Unimaginitive and showed lack of any substantial design other then put it on the wall and it will be a sports bar. Pictures, jerseys, pennants, and TVs do not make an environment. It felt empty and hollow. \n\nOVERALL\n\nDont bother. You can do better many other places. I am sorry to say. I do not know anything about the finances behind the restaurant However, if it is not going to be supported as a losing entity Beef O Bradys days are aleady numbered."
0,"Maybe it was an off day or something for this place..  Stopped in for lunch today, it's a Saturday.  Place is in a strip mall.  Decorations are something you would see in party city around Mardi Gras time, (pretty cheesy).  Service was nice and friendly.  Now lets get down to the food part of this.  \nI'm very hesitate to say but I must, it wasn't good.. Yes I've read the other reviews but I've been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I don't think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldn't taste any spice at all on anything.  Food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile.\nMy husband and I ordered the Boudin Balls for an app.  Now those were decent.  I ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Po'boy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half., sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish, it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Po'boy, it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips, ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them.\nI felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his, first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage, it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.  \nSo yeah.. not sure if it's what we ordered or what, but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley.\nP.S.  My husband ordered Tea, it's wasn't Louisiana Tea, nor sweet as they make it in the south... would have been nice to have been given the option for sweet tea!"
1,Excellent food but pricy.
0,"really disappointed in my last experience.  lost items i had won because they claimed there was a credit card issues on a card i had used with them many times before that had no chance of being declined.  probably 75% of the electronics i have purchased here have been unusable.  a few deals to be had, but like all auctions this is buyer beware.  out of probably 30 laptops purchased there, not a single one has worked without a large amount of parts and work.  cell phones are usually reported lost/stolen."
1,"Housed in a small three story building in Old Town Montreal's touristy cobblestone district sits Creperie Chez Suzette (CCS) \n\nI sat myself inside CCS and found it quaint despite the bustling streets. I think that the French country decorations added to the quaintness to it. I sat at a table at the front of the restaurant near the open windows to people watch. It provided great entertainment while I waited for my order.\n\nIt serves crepes in hardy sizes, sizes that I've never seen before, even in Paris. I could barely finish the first one. Admittedly, I had a small salad before hand that may have damped my eating capacity.\n\nCCS is moderately priced for a wide variety of crepes from vegetarian to the rich and dangerous sweet filled crepes sauced in chocolate, saddled with ice cream and filled with fruit - strawberries or bananas."
0,"When i was in Vegas, me and my friends wanted to eat good so we tried the Ruth's Chris here on Flamingo down the street from RIO.  To start off, my roommate Eugene wore a wife beater shirt and they would NOT let us in!! I was like \""wth??\""....Even i was wearing a beater as well but because i'm a girl, it's acceptable and for him it's not?? Whatever...anyhow, Eugene ended up wearing one of my girly fuschia cardigans in!! LOL!! it was SOOOOOOOO funny!! they let us in and us 4 ate there.  The girly cardigan was stretched beyond belief but it was fine with me because i was going to throw it away anyhow.  The host sat us down with a dirty look.  What a snotty girl.  Don't they want to make more money??  Anyways, i ordered their filet mignon and it was not even done right, i asked for it rare medium and they thought i was retarded until i explained it to them.  At first the waiter kind of snappy with me and said \""we only do it medium rare, that's what you're talking about, correct?\""....i said to him \""i want it more rare than medium and that's why i said rare medium and not medium rare\"".  I think he got offended or something.  I'm no chef by any means but i told them that i would like it about 125-130 degrees farenheit if that makes it easier for the chef.  I said it in the most genuinely and sincere way but i still don't think he appreciated me telling him. LOL, whatevers...i was having a good time watching my friend act gay with my hot pink cardigan on. hahahaha, The steak turned out whatevers.  Service was rude, food was overpriced and not even made close to my liking.  The one in Orange County is SOOO much better, they actually care about their customers and the chefs take pride in their cooking skills.  We left them a good $25 tip for our $100 bill, but i also left a lil note letting them know that they should lighten up a bit ;)  Oh, and if you're the owner/manager at this specific Ruth's Chris and you're reading my review, tell your host that works there on sunday nights that i think she needs to take a break and relax already!!! ::))"
1,"I've stayed here a few times.  Always consistent. Service, rooms, restaurants and casino are all A+.  We had a lame experience at Sea Blue but that was it."
0,"Never. Again. *hork* \n\nI have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! \n\nA few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. \n\nPOSITIVE: \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and chipper. \n\nNEGATIVE: \n\nBut alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the \""shot glass\"" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. \n\nThe waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... \n\n1) we never got our edamame, \n\n2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... \n\n3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. \n\nPOSITIVE: \n\nShe took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. \n\nNEGATIVE: \n\nNo apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. \n\nAlso, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. \n\nAnd finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... \n\nPOSITIVE: \n\nFor the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last)."
0,"Restaurant is beautifully decorated and has great potential.  However, the food needs work.  The hummus was some of the worst I've had...very bland and pasty.  The falafel sandwich was ok, but also lacking in flavor.  The chicken shawarma was drenched in nutmeg, making it the only flavor that you could taste.  The eggplant appetizer was the only bright point in the meal.  Although heavily drenched in oil, the flavor was good.  The service was good and pleasant.  I was so hoping for a delicious middle eastern restaurant close to home.  The search continues..."
0,"Went with friends this weekend.  Couldn't get the bartenders attention or one of 3 waiters (or 2 waiters and a bus boy) if we set ourselves on fire.  The place had maybe 12 people.  We told them after 15 minutes why we were leaving and they said, \""we'll, we don't have a hostess today.\""   Why would that matter??   We weren't greeted, we didn't have anyone take our drink order, and nobody gave us menus in 15 minutes.   I will not try them again."
1,"Have to say up front, the fact that this place moved to a new venue is a blessing and a curse; on the one hand, the neighborhood it's in now is much safer (an important factor for people like me who have to walk back to a car alone in the dark after these shows), but it's now further away and parking can be harder to find. Life gives and takes, I suppose...\n\nNow, to the meat of this review: while my favorite place for cheap improv is actually Pittsburgh's Friday Nite Improv show, I'm still fairly fond of Steel City Improv Theater. Pittsburgh has an amazing improv scene overall, which I didn't actually realize until speaking to the folks here almost a year ago. Steel City stands out from the local crowd in part because of its emphasis on long-form improv (doing a longer, \""themed\"" comedy show, as opposed to what amounts to a three minute stand-up piece in short-form) and also because of the classes that it offers. Seriously, locals - if you're looking for a place that actually has classes for improv, this is the place to go; I've only ever heard good things about the classes, and a couple of my friends who took them have moved on to form their own comedy group.\n\nAlso, the people who work or volunteer here, and the people who come through performing, are all kind, polite, talented folks - an absolute joy to talk to and to watch, even if the shows don't go quite as well as we want them to. You can just tell that everyone is having a good time - the most important part of a comedy show!\n\nAll in all: can't say I've ever had a bad time when I've gone here, even if I'm not always a fan of \""long-form improv.\"" I say, look up some show times, schedule a dinner date and head here for some entertainment one night - you won't be disappointed. A note to parents: realize that these shows are performed by adults, for adults, so unless you want your kids repeating swear words all the way home, find a babysitter. Think of it as a great excuse for a date night.\n\nBy the way, bring a few bucks to pay for the tickets ($5) and for some cheap beverages (alcohol's available) and snacks."
1,"I don't usually give five star reviews, but this place really went out of their way to treat us well at lunch.  I wasn't expecting much from a place connected to a mall, but the menu was diverse and the beer selections were excellent.  We started with the cajun calamari which was good and then the large and fresh entree salads were brought out.\n\nI ordered a pizza which was brought out by the manager who said it was too burnt for their standards, so we could have it if we wanted it and they were remaking the pizza.  How often does a restaurant have enough integrity to fix a mistake before the customer even asks?  They brought the second pizza later and it was top notch.\n\nSam Adams Cherry Wheat on draft, a good pizza, and superior service.  A winning combination!"
0,"Stayed here for one night because my boyfriend and I were going to a concert at the Joint and didn't want to deal with the traffic and having to drive home (we live in Henderson, just outside of Vegas). We stayed in a pretty basic suite in the Casino Tower. It was just overall a pretty bad experience. \n\nCheck-in was easy and the guy at the front desk that helped me, James, was really friendly and helpful. When we went to check out on the tv, it said their system was down, but we called the front desk and they let us check out over the phone which was convenient. However, the room itself was not very clean when we got there. There was dust everywhere. it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned or stayed in in weeks, possibly months. There was even what looked like a blood stain on the curtains. \n\nThere are signs all over the casino and hotel that says \""no outside food or beverage allowed\"" which is just plain ridiculous if they're going to charge you $8 for a bottle of water in the room. We still ended up bringing our own food and some drinks from home, but once we ran out of water, we were pretty much screwed. We ended up just drinking water from the sink. \n\nThe rooms here are not in any way shape or form soundproof. Once the concert was over and we had eaten, it was already about 2am. We were so tired, we just wanted a good nights rest. Not going to happen at this hotel. First of all, it is very close to the airport, so planes were flying right over us and it was SO LOUD. I know this isn't something the hotel can control, but it just shows how terrible of a location it's in. Also, in the room we had, the window was looking onto the rooftop of the casino and there were incredibly loud generators running all night that kept waking me up. We could hear people throughout the entire night walking and talking in the hallway. \n\nAlso, the location of this hotel is not amazing. This is a part of vegas that I would NEVER go to alone and I definitely would not recommend leaving the hotel if you decide to stay here. It is not on the strip and it's a further walk from it than you would expect. If you stay here but want to go to other casinos, you better take a cab or have a car. \n\nThe only positives about this hotel is the decor and the Joint. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from Hard Rock - modern with a punk influence and the Joint was awesome! A great intimate venue (but the drinks are extremely overpriced - $7 for a very small cheap beer like shocktop - you could buy a whole 6-pack at the CVS across the street for that much!)\n\nBasically, just don't stay here unless you're looking to party hard in your hotel and piss everyone on your floor off. The staff doesn't do anything about parties and loud music in the suites. I've had a few friends get suites just to throw parties and you can hear the music all the way down the hall, but staff never said a word to them. They obviously don't care about the customers in suites that are actually trying to get some rest at 3 in the morning."
1,"Yes at times the level of service may fluctuate depending on how busy they are but it hasn't stopped me from coming back again, and again nor has it stopped my kids from requesting it on family night!  You cant beat the prices and the wings and drinks are always fresh and pleasing.  You can come hang at the bar and even do a lil karaoke. Or you can bring the fam and watch a game on any one of the hundred tv's on the walls.  My favorite drink is the \""Liquid Marijuana\""  and my fav wing flavors are spicy honey mustard, asiago parm and bar b que HOT! Matter fact Im about to go eat there right now! I love this place. Maybe the problem is YOU, ever think about that? LOL #some people are just hard to please"
1,Pretty good food... pretty authentic its expensive but its vegas so win some money and pay... haha.... I'm really chinese so I can tell you that the food is good but its lacking in MSG. Its not as msg filled as most asian places so it tastes good but not like china-town. Most people should like this...
0,"The zoo is ok, and has become nicer over the years. For a zoo, which caters to little kids, there sure is a ton if walking between exhibits. Very poorly planned if you have kids under 3 who want to walk. I would suggest heading west to the wildlife world zoo. My kids much prefer that zoo over this one."
1,"I rated this doctor's office a 5 star office because I absolutely adore Dr. Stewart. I have been seeing him for over 20 years, since I was a child. He has seen apart every member of my family also. He has taken the time to get to know each of us. It is so nice to visit a doctor that already knows and remembers your family history, medication, and medical conditions. I have seen other doctors, due to insurance changes over the years, and been so upset by my experiences. Now my insurance choices are based solely on whether or not I will continue to be able to see him! He is hands-down the best doctor in the valley!"
0,"Horrible Horrible! First I was \""given\"" tickets to get in. Only reason why I would go to a place called \""The Bank\"" to dance and drink. Got there thinking that there would probably be a long line, but that was fine since I was there with my girls and we would have fun anywhere. We get there and there are two lines and a third \""line\"" that was basically a crowd of people \""begging\"" to get in. The bouncers are totally rude and think their \""sh&t don't stink.\"" They totally pick and choose whoever they want to get in. For some reason only couples were getting in. You would think that they would want more girls there (3 of us) since all I saw getting in through the \""reserved table\"" line were guys. \nThe following is what was really made us leave. So one of the bouncers told a couple to go to the front of the line and they jump over the rope to get into one of the \""real\"" lines and he told them \""I didn't tell you to jump the rope you never jump the rope you were to just (push) yer way to the front\"" of the \""fake\"" line. Then he said \""now you have to wait\"" and closed the line off with the robe....  MY JAW DROPPED!!! WTF! IS THIS SECOND GRADE??!??!? Then a minute later another bouncer came back and lifted their \""time out.\"""
0,"I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I want to support independent \""original\"" restaurants here in Madison.  And I had a $10 coupon.  So I thought the fam and I would give it a try.\n\nThis may be one of the worst restaurants in Madison I have been to.\n\nComplete tourist trap.\n\nThe service was poor.  Our waitress was nice enough but just sloppy in general.  A table of two sat down 15 minutes after we did.  They waited atleast 10 minutes before one of them flagged down a waitress, who came over, asked for their drink order.  They ordered their drinks and appetizers.  Neither came within 20 minutes.  They got up and left.  I felt absolutely horrible for them.\n\nWe ordered two kids meals, I ordered the fish fry, and my wife a tilapia.  I did get a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was the only decent tasting dish, but that's probably because it had a stick of butter in it.  My fish fry was easily subpar, my wife's dish was cold and very bland.  My kids.... liked their french fries and chicken tenders (what kid doesn't?).  \n\nThe view here, if you can call it that, isn't that impressive, even though they label themselves as \""Madison's only lakeside restaurant.\""  \n\nI will never go back, unfortunately.  This place seems very much like a tourist trap with mediocre food at above average prices.  *sigh*  And I just read the Madison Magazine's \""Best\"" and this place was voted #3 for seafood!?  Just goes to show that that Magazine is not about objectivity but about \""who can get people to vote the most.\"""
1,"Love their products (massage bars are my absolute favorite), love this store. Kinda miss the former tenant, medium-rated fro-yo place, but super glad that the store is more convenient- love the Fashion Show mall (located in between Forever 21 & Starbucks, lower level, sort-of reverse triangle shape), as compared to the Mandalay Bay casino's shopping center (er, I mean hallway). Came here for a couple things a couple weeks ago: henna & massage bar (use this as moisturizer because my skin is super dry). Quick visit, but the employees were helpful, nice, and also use the products too. What's not to love about natural cosmetics, not tested on animals? \n\nAnyhoo, it's a little on the small side (a nice use of space, BTW), but you can still find all your favorite Lush products. I would so love to spend a considerable amount here one day, but for now, I'll make my purchases small as christmas is around the corner...wink, wink."
1,"Love this place!!!!  They have pizzas under $20, pastas in the $20-$30 range, and nice meals $30+.\n\nA friend came in from Cali for a convention so I took her here to eat. IF you get a little later reservation, like 8:15 8:30, and sit by the window or on the patios you have an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains, they also go off more often after 8 or 830 like every 15 minutes.  Which is just awesome.\n\nMy guy friend got the Halibut [priced around $50] which was fantastic! In fact, it was better than mine. I got scallops on top of risotto cakes with beets and Brussels Sprouts [I would never have eaten this dish when I was little] anyhow it was good, but I would def order the Halibut next time :). I had meal envy.\n\nMy Cali friend ordered Salmon on top of risotto, I don't eat Salmon, but it looked good. She cleaned her plate than quickly mention she was def going to have to hit the gym when she got back home.  We shared a bottle of Russian River Cab too which was amazing!  She loved this place and said next time she came in town she was going back. Score 1 for me!\n\nI was a little sad b/c they used to have this 'rabbit 2 ways dish' and they changed it. Keep in mind this place was the first and last time I've ever eaten rabbit and it was to die for. So they do update their menu."
0,"HORRIBLE service this time around!!!\nand it was by Marcus Schultheis \""Store Manager\"" and \""Area Manager\""??? really???\nZERO customer service skills.\n\nI had purchased items there on 5/2013 with a salesman named Moon, I had a great experience so when I had more mattress needs I went there. I was told he was at another store.\nI asked if he could help me but he was busy with another customer and took my name and number and would call me back.\nThe evening passed...\nNext day I was driving by the store at 4:30pm and decided to stop by.\n\""Marcus\"" acknowledged he took the call with no aplologies for not returning call.\nI asked about what I needed and he pointed it out.

1,"Amazing!!! Anything I've ordered has been so good and consistent every time!! From the hummus /fresh pita  to the lintel soup or my favorite Greek salad with chicken swigmira , I've yet to be let down!"
1,"I didn't stay at their hotel so this review is for the casino. As far as casinos go, Planet Hollywoods one is okay. It's clean looking and dealers are fairly friendly. Not sure if this is a plus or a minus, but out of all the casinos I visited, this was the only casino where all the dealers were dressed slutty, in bustiers and thigh highs. Other casinos has some dealers dressed in that way but not all. That didn't really give off a good impression upon me. I lose money at this casino...but my first win in vegas was here..too bad it wasn't a great win haha. \n\nI love how Earl's Sandwiches was 24/7 and they also had Miracle Miles shops connected so it's super convenient."
1,"I just found something else incredible about Ranch Market, and I'm going to have to up it to 5 stars as a result. Wednesdays are special produce days, which means that tons of different produce items are on special for 3 pounds for $.99. Yes, my friends. $.99. \n\nI had seen the special pricing advertised on the flyers we get every now and then, but had been hesitant to make a special trip there in case the produce was bad-quality or ran out after, say, 10 am. Well, I went today around 1 pm, and I can tell you that the produce is neither bad-quality or gone after 10 am. There were tons of the special advertised items, and 90% looked super-fresh. \n\nI left with 2-3 pounds of bananas, tomatoes, peaches, key limes, and avocados, all of which cost me a mere $5.62. And just think - just yesterday, I spent $2 for 3 tomatoes at Whole Foods. I'll definitely be back at least every other Wednesday to snag some of these special deals."
0,"Really sloppy place and badly managed. She prepared our three bagels on the counter that had a LOT of crumbs from various different bagels/sandwiches on it. She dropped one bagel with salmon cream cheese upside down on this counter, and it clearly picked up a lot of crumbs - you could see the polka-dots. Then she didn't bother wiping the counter (ICK), and made another strawberry bagel, then a pumpkin bagel on the same crumby counter. Used one knife to cut all the bagels, didn't wipe between. So our bagels had a combo of poppy seed, everything bagel, odd sweet flavor in the salmon bagel, disconcerting savory and pumpkin in the strawberry bagel. Two of us have had diarrhea this afternoon. FIND A DIFFERENT PLACE TO GO!! THIS ONE SUCKS"
1,"The only dim sum I've had in Vegas, but it's done well at Ping Pang Pong! Okay yes, the name is pretty ridiculous and stereotypical to Chinese people, but don't let that turn you off! This place is pretty legit.\n\nA lot of reviewers mention that the wait is pretty crazy, but I've came here on weekdays only and never had to wait for a table, so maybe it's only crazy on weekends?\n\nAll the dishes we've had were good, but we've only came here for dim sum, so I'm not sure (but curious) how their other food is.\n\nService is decent, which I'm used to at Chinese restaurants, so it's good enough for me!\n\nKind of shocked that this place was noted as the 'Best Chinese Restaurant of 2011'. Is nothing good in Chinatown then? Haha."
0,This review is for the restaurant side of the business. Brought the family here because we had heard good things about the place. When you walk in you're immediately hit with cigarette smoke. It was like standing near a huge ash tray it just was nasty. Because the bar is separated from the restaurant they're are no waitress in the restaurant side. We had to wait more than 5 minutes for someone to show up. We almost left but finally a waitress showed up and  seated us. I ordered the steak dinner and I'll just say I wish I would've ordered something else. The steak tasted like it was cooked on the street out back. Really tough and just tasted rank. I asked for medium and got super well done. My wife ordered the same thing and asked for medium also and hers was more done than mine! I can't comment on the rest of the food because we don't plan on going back. I have heard the bar portion is a lot better but I don't know personally. Just for the smell alone is enough for me not to go back.
1,The place is beautiful and the service was great. The lunch menu could have had more pasta dishes in my opinion. Food was good but nothing I would go back for and the eggplant lasagna was a bit salty. Overall it's a nice place to check out at least once but a bit overpriced.
1,"I don't like regular pizza, so this my pizza place of choice.  The Bo-Diddley is great.  The service is good and the staff works hard, but looks like they enjoy themselves.  The pricing is a tiny bit high for what you get, but I still make two meals out of one pizza, so it works for me (no one else I know can make two meals out of the pizza...so if you've got a healthy appetite, don't expect leftovers.)  Pass on the garlic cheese bread, unless you've got an incredible craving for it...it's just average.  The salads are good."
1,"I went here for a work holiday party.  We had rented out the whole space, so I can't comment like the below people did on the normal crowd or decor, but for a holiday party, it was awfully nice. \n\nThey had waiters walking around with appetizers as well as a table stuffed full of interesting items - chicken curry and date kabobs, black bean dip on homemade tortilla chips, pot roast brushetta (a personal favorite), tiny crab cakes which were very tasty and scallops which were the worst of all the things I tasted.  They were definitely frozen and kind of cold. \n\nOf the champagne cocktails, I had two and was really pleased.  I had the Perle 75 which is served with St Germain's elderflower liquor, gin, cucumber, lemon and champagne.  It was refreshing and I don't say that I am a gin drinker.  The other was the Rose Bud - st germain's again, grapefruit juice and rose champagne.  It was very pretty and very tasty.  \n\nIt's not the type of place that I would normally go - I am more of a beer drinker or a classic cocktail - but it was interesting.\n\nI kept checking out the LED's that people seemed very bothered by in other reviews.  Personally, I thought they were festive.  There were also circles of LED's on the ceiling that were very pleasing.  And like most of the other reviews, the wait staff was immensely attentive and very friendly."
1,"the scene: las vegas\nthe players: michelle, ryan, scott, natalie, aaron, cameron, haley & maya \nthe occasion: best friends trip, halloween, the SF giants in the world series\nthe mood: euphoric\n\nso i've been to vegas more times than i can count. sometimes up to several times in one calendar year. what can i say, there is no place like this town.... no place.\n\nfor many years now, i've been an extremely satisfied patron of the venetian hotel. when i find something i really love, i stay with it. i'm loyal that way. this particular vegas trip was a last minute soiree though, and i let someone else take the reigns in planning it. well, high fives to cameron. he chose the wynn, and it was a great choice.\n\ni never use this word, but the feeling you get when you walk in their front lobby is, opulence. everything is lush, the design is smooth and flawless. it feels like las vegas, but with more panache. \n\nthis was a very special trip for us. first, this was a vacation with my nearest and dearest friends. my SF gang, my posse, my tribe. my best friends in the world.... (yeah, i know you guys are gonna read this, and i love you fucking hyenas more than life itself) \n\nthis was also halloween weekend AND.... this is a very big AND, the giants were going to be playing games 3. 4 and 5 of the world series while we were there. as natives of san francisco, and all of us die hard giants fans, our schedule would obsessively revolve around these games.\n\ncameron talked us into \""resort deluxe panoramic view\"" suites... which means floor-to-ceiling windows and sweeping views of the vegas strip. yeah, i've seen it all before, but the view from our rooms just felt extra magical. especially after a few bottles of champagne before heading out for the night... you're all dolled up, the flashing lights glittering below you. it just sets the tone for the whole evening. the rooms were immaculate and offer cozy beds with fancy linens, a separate seating area with couches, a dining room with table, marble-rich bathrooms, remote controls for the lighting and drapes, etc etc etc. the works. service was top notch.\n\nthe rest of the hotel is exactly what you would expect for vegas. nothing is overlooked or spared, down to every snazzy detail. we spent a ton of time gambling in their casino areas, delightfully nursed our hangovers by their pool with our kir royales, partied like frat boys at XS and blush, dined like royalty at bartlotta (my second time there) and crawled back to our rooms at the break of dawn with nothing but an amused smile from the service staff.\n\ncameron got a big, wet sloppy kiss for being such a great party planner. it was a trip i won't soon forget. do i still love the venetian hotel? definitely! will i stay at the wynn again though? absolutely!\n\nviva las vegas baby."
1,"I enjoyed lunch here the other day.  Service was spot-on, and my panini was delicious.  I was also nicely surprised - the decor and atmosphere at The Cove are really very nice....as well as spotless.  Next time, I think I'll try one of their salads for lunch....they looked sensational!\nAnd by the way, earlier the same week, some friends and I had lunch at The Herb Box at Southbridge. This was my request, after hearing so many people rave about it.\nFood, no complaints....nothing to rave about, though.  Service -terrible-inattentive-took forever to even get water glasses!  Side-by-side comparison...The Cove is BY FAR superior.  I don't go out of my way to be a negative reviewer....but if you have a choice - you'll have a better meal, and a much more pleasant experience if you try The Cove."
0,"We went here after reading many stellar reviews and hearing from friends that it was the best food in town.  First things, first the waitresses and hostesses were not very pleasant.  They hardly welcomed us in at 6:30 on a Sunday.  It was about 85 degrees out and the building doesn't appear to have AC which was clearly ticking them off, but as people who are trying to help them make money for the evening I was put out by their attitudes.  We decided to dine outside where our smile-less waitress continued to bus the table next to us.  Rather than taking the previous diners full glasses of water back to the kitchen she chose to hurl the water into the street while we were eating.  Now I know this isn't a fancy restaurant but along with the sour puss she wore the whole time we were there I found this to be rude.  The food was decent, but one of the entrees was over cooked.  When we didn't ask to box it she asked if there was something wrong and I told her the beef was really really tough.  She said she would take it off the bill and did, thankfully.  When I went in later to drop off the check she did finally come out with a little personality and say that she tried our dish and it was awful and that she was sorry.  All in all there wasn't anything that would encourage me to come back."
1,Like its sister casino the Green Valley Ranch this place is a cozy and modern away from the hustle and bustle of the strip with reasonable prices.  \n\nI love the location it has a palm springs feel to it and you really are not overwhelmed you can actually relax and spend time with family.
1,"Tiki Ice is a small stand in Town Square Las Vegas, near the central Childrens' Park area.  They serve delicious, natural frozen fruit treats that are quite inexpensive, and they strive to be environmentally conscious in their business model.  \n\nApparently a student-run business, all the people who work there are friendly and offer free samples of their wares.  With compostable cups and spoons made from plant starches instead of plastics (oil!), and entirely reasonable prices ($2 for a scoop!), I highly recommend it."
1,"If you aren't looking for Cafe du Jour, you just might miss this hidden gem of a restaurant located on East Carson Street in Southside.  I'm always surprised by how many of my friends who frequent the Southside have never heard of this place.  In my opinion, Cafe du Jour is one of the most outstanding restaurants in Pittsburgh.\n\nI've dined here several times throughout the past year, and the food is consistently fantastic.  Admittedly, I've always ordered the same thing...the roasted eggplant rolled with fresh mozzarella and topped with creamy pesto.  Always delicious, always prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients.  The appetizer crepes are wonderful as well.  \n\nWhen I dined here for my birthday last year, I finished my meal with a piece of the flourless chocolate cake...it was beautifully presented and even came with a birthday candle!  Perfect ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant for a romantic evening or special occasion dinner.  Keep in mind that the place is BYOB and cash only.  Reservations are also highly recommended, as the dining room is very small and intimate.  In the summertime, they have an outdoor patio/garden area that is very pleasant to dine in.  If you're looking to try somewhere new for dinner in the Southside, put this at the top of your list...you won't be disappointed!"
0,The food was excellent! The wine coolers could've used a little better explanation on which ones were sweeter. Service was terrible the waitress forgot to put our order in and then asked us if we ordered and once we told her it was with her she told us she forgot. No comp for anything. She said she was sorry but we sat there an extra 20 minutes for no reasons and it wasn't even that busy. She seemed more into socializing then remembering orders. If the food wasn't so good I would never go back. The pizza was incredible and the donuts were to die for.
1,"Soga Restaurant just opened a few months ago in an upstairs restaurant location.  Their specialty is shabu shabu, a cook your own food items in a grill or soup hotplate. However, their lunch menu has some really tasty items that are under $10 - good for the student State Street crowd. The shabu shabu can be shared among 2-3 people. \n\nI ordered their tomato egg drop soup - it was really huge, and came with a side of steamed white glutinous rice. Others at my table ordered the shabu shabu of which there are dozens upon dozens of combination ingredients (mushroom, thin sliced beef, water chestnuts, Chinese veggies, etc.). Another person ordered their garlic eggplant dish which seemed better than average.  Service was really good.\n\nThere's a bar in the back and I can see how the vision for this place was for it to be a late night, classy restaurant with nice curtains, nice tables and chairs, with a nice second floor view. I'm definitely coming back here to try their other items.\n\nThe lunch food reminded me of the much praised Sezchuan restaurant on Park St, Ichiban, but with the geographic advantage of being on State Street."
1,"I spend way too much time in coffee shops..  Being a student I often find myself going to one when I need to get out of the house (too many distractions) and get some hard core reading in.   I've been to the big chains and you can find me pouring over books in out of the way cafe's.  I've been to hipster joints, shi shi posh pinky finger up when you sip espresso places.  I've seen the highs and lows.  So what puts Grouchy John's heads and tails above the rest simple they care.  From the drinks to the way they treat customers they just care.  I've been here a few times now, and have just decided to up my frequency on today's visit.  Things I have noticed on my stay here firstly they seem to know their customers, now I'm not just talking drink preference any average Joe can do that, but they truly seem to know them and like them.  If I weren't the jaded individual I am I would assume that they're inviting some of their customers over for Sunday brunch, as they seem like old time buddies.  Now am on that level of chummieness with the staff, no, but that did not stop them from walking to my table and asking me if I wanted a glass of water. I know there is somebody out there saying, \""well whats the big deal with that\"".  Well it is a big deal.... when was the last time somebody did that for you?  In fact I have seen them treat everybody with that same level of thoughtfulness and respect.  Now if this doesn't convince you to give them a try then let me just say this board games and star wars.... now if you don't like any of those things I think you're better off getting a coffee from the gas station because you sir are dead inside."
0,"Don't even think about being late to your appointment!\nLet me preface this by saying I am not a big fan of suddenly slimmer who owns Rio Wax. I used to go there quite often but after being treated so rudely several times, I decided to spend my money elsewhere. \nI purchased a groupon for Rio Wax & was excited that Danielli opened her own place because she was the only good thing about suddenly slimmer. Of course everyone else feels the same way so it is nearly impossible to get an appt with her. The first few times I went to Rio Wax, I had as much of a pleasant experience as one can have when she gets a wax service. The people were nice, I was satisfied with the results, it was kind-of pricey but overall worth it. \nThis last visit reminded me of being at Suddenly Slimmer all over again. I scheduled an appointment 3 weeks in advance as I prepared for a vacation to Cabo. I called on my way to let them know I would be 5 - 10 minutes late since there was an accident by my house & I would have to go a different route. The girl on the phone told me they may not be able to hold my appointment because they had back to back appointments. This surprised me considering I was doing the courteous thing by calling ahead & it was not something I had any control over. She put me on hold & came back & said that would be fine. She failed to mention there was construction on Indian School Road & you could not make a left turn onto 32nd street. Anyway, by the time I made it through that mess, I was a whopping 7 minutes late. I walked in & apologized. The receptionist then proceeds to tell me the esthetician may or may not be able to complete my entire wax. I nearly dropped my jaw. I don't know about you but I have sat in that waiting room plenty of times because they were behind & never once complained & this was the answer I get for being 7 minutes late! If this was such a problem, then offer an alternative time. It wouldn't have thrilled me to have to go back later but it was better than offering me a partial wax!\nI voiced all of this & reminded them that there are plenty of other salons in this city. \nI'm in the customer service industry & I understand things don't always work out the way we would like & it is not always easy to accommodate everyone but at least find an alternative solution. If you look at Suddenly Slimmers reviews, you would think Rio Wax would want to build a better name for themselves."
1,"Having lived in New Delhi as a child for 4 years, I have always been on the lookout for a good Indian restaurant in the States, wherever I have lived (I even found a good one in Fort Wayne, Indiana!).  For most Indian restaurants, the trend is to put out large tubs of curries and tandoori chicken made with ready-made pastes.  With pre-made pastes, it is impossible to get a fantastic Indian meal, it must be made with fresh ingredients, from scratch (even down to making your own cheese).  It got to the point that I could not scratch that itch for the authentic tasting stuff so I started making it on my own at home.  Just like Mexican food, the best stuff is made at home, not in the restaurants.  \n  \nHowever, the Tandoori Times bistro came along in Scottsdale and I had finally found my culinary nirvana.  Then as if prayers were being answered, Tandoori Times 2 came to Glendale.  Their tandoori chicken is exactly as I remembered it at Modhi Mahal's in Delhi, as is the dal, nan, mattar paneer.  \n  \nI've read a lot of mixed reviews of TT2 here on Yelp ranging from \""beyond bad\"" to exquisite.  I don't understand this, maybe because most Americans don't know what to expect with Indian food because they either think it's native American food or they've never had it in their life before (most Americans already know Mexican food, whether they like it or not).  One thing about food from India, is that it is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of years.  Mexican food as we know it (tacos, enchiladas, tostadas etc.) is relatively new.  Why is this important to know?  Well, even the rice is different, basmati rice has been developed for thousands of years to get the size of grain and taste:  they CARE about what grain of rice they use, it has to be basmati (Uncle Joe's Brown rice just isn't the same, sorry).  This is the feeling I get from TT2, they know what authentic Indian food is and what it takes to make it and it is no trivial, slap-a-burger-on-the-grill-and-fry-it type of food.  It takes days of preparation to put out the correct recipe and it doesn't come from canned pastes.  \n  \nThis really shows up in the end result at Tandoori Times 2 and makes their somewhat high priced menu worth it if you know what really goes into making good cuisine of India.  Finally someone is putting in the time and effort to making really good Indian food."
1,"Gorgeous during the holidays. There is a massive Christmas tree in the lobby and tons of decor to match. This seems like a really old building but is extremely well kept. The staff are super friendly as most everyone is Pittsburgh seemed. I wish I could have stayed here a little longer but this was a stop on my way to new work. \n\nA solid 6 hour drive to NY,NY from here. Worth staying at."
1,"This took me by surprise!  Now anyone who knows me knows that I like top end places, especially with my lotions and potions. Now I am also a strict vegetarian, so have been trying to only use products that are not tested on animals or have any non veggie ingredients and that the companies producing them are members of PETA (People for the ethical treatment of animals. \nNow that is a big ask and amazingly Superdrug are on this list.  I have been in a few times and I am now using their face wash daily \u00a33.49 a bottle compared with my previous \u00a327 a bottle more expensive brand.\n\nNow I am aware that it doesn't have the plush surroundings or snazzy addresses of its counterparts, I am pleasantly surprised and I have even joined up to their points card.\n\nWell done Superdrug on your good ethics!"
1,Good thing they are expanding to several locations. Try their ready made hummus. My favorite is the spicy chicken wrap which is huge!
1,"The music, ambiance, and vibe are amazing ! Everyone dining is so happy and you can see they are really enjoying their food. My pear endive salad was great and my filet mignon medallion was phenomenal! We were a party if 8 and everyone raved about the food! I have dined here several times and have never been disappointed!"
0,"The first time I went to get a massage I arrived to an empty waiting room. After waiting 15 minutes I was told my appointment would need to be cancelled because they didn't have time. I booked this 4 weeks in advance (the soonest they could get me in)!\n\nI opted to just get a 40 minute massage (for same price, no partial refund) as I drove very far. The massage was sub par. \n\nFor my second massage (which was pre-paid for), I drove one hour in traffic from work.  AGAIN when I arrived I was told the appointment was cancelled!!! This time there was nothing they could do and the receptionist could not give me a refund because she didn't \""know how to use the computer.\""\n\nThey still have my $60 and it's almost two months later! I've called and called with no return call to get my money back! Do not go here!"
1,"Wonderful Pumpkin Batter Pancakes, with the right amount of whip cream, cinnamon and cream cheese...yum! Orange juice full of pulp to fight the scurvy. Boyfriend had the  Meat Lovers skillet...he also rated 4 stars. Only questionable item- dirty windows, they make you look around a little. But next time we're in town, we will be back!"
0,This wasnt great at all. Fried chicken was VERY DRY and hard to eat my husband had the catfish and wasnt impressed at all. The greens however were very good but wont be going back for that alone. Ella Ems in North vegas is MUCH better.
0,"On our last visit here (Never EVER AGAIN), wifey found a Short and Curly in her crepe.  Luckily she didn't eat any of it yet.\n\nEff you, OPH!   NPH Would NEVER Do that!"
1,"Great mid priced, local Mom & Pop italian diner.  I had the $1 slice and $1 off beer on happy hour and it was great.  Affordable for families but loaded with good selections.\n\nI loof forward to returning and trying the pastas - Bob J.'s review of the Gnocchi with spinach and bacon really caught my eye.  Didn't see it on the menu though."
1,"This review is for a visit and not a stay. I thought this was a fun casino here at the rio, it's off the main strip but worth a visit!     \nI liked the I-Bar (we had full table service here for a birthday party so all i could drink was covered and top shelve...even better!!) bartenders and servers were all nice.\nEnjoyed the world buffet, many choices of food here. The buffet attracts crowds here so expect a wait in line.\nThe mardi gras flying floats are a lot of fun, and i had a great time at the rooftop club \""Voodoo Lounge\"" great views but pricey up there.\nAll in all i enjoyed my time here and even left with a little more money then i arrived with,\neven better!!"
0,"If it weren't for the location, there'd be no reason to go to this theatre. \n\nI went this past weekend with my family. Firstly, the escalators were broken and the only open concession was upstairs. We took the elevator. Then, after some indecision, I settled on something to eat - only to find out they don't have it! My dad, always the funny one, said, \""They even have prices for what they don't sell. And pictures too!\"" \n\nWe got our treats, found our theatre and claimed our seats. I walked next door while I munched and waited for my previews to start. The room next to ours felt like a sauna. Poor movie goers. That would suck to be stuck in a 85-degree room on a 105 degree day. Ugh. \n\nBathrooms were typical - no surprises there. \n\nThere are many other BETTER theatres to venture to on the weekend, or any other day, for that matter. I wouldn't recommend this place, unless you're already on Mill, you got your parking validated and you simply can't justify going somewhere else."
1,Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient.  The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!
1,"Awesome!\n\nGreat service, awesome food and memorable drinks.\n\nWhat more could you ask for?  Ate here with the wife and some of our close friends. Everyone had a good time.\n\nFor the quality of food and the service, it is reasonably priced. I had the Tuna and it was absolutely sushi grade.\n\nBTW. if you are hanging out downtown on a weekday,  Chart House has a great happy hour from 2-6 pm on weekdays in their bar. $5 appetizers and $5 drinks. We took advantage of it multiple times while we were in Vegas. Chocolate Martini and Humus Trio are excellent."
0,Food was ok. Some dishes great others lacking. Service was poor. Server non attentive and un-apologetic when she forgot to enter our order. Would not go back as there are better Italian options on the strip.
0,"This was the second food adventure I had while visiting AZ for the past weekend with my friends.\n\nI'm not that big into burgers, but I had to try this place ever since I've seen it on the Travel Channel.  I was a little scared since this place cooks everything in LARD, but when in Rome...\n\nThis place gets a 2 stars for a couple of reasons.  First, the burger I had wasn't that great.  It tasted like a back yard bbq session.  I was expecting a little bit more.  Second, after we got done eating my other friends felt like crap the whole day.  I believe they spent some time with the porcelain seat back at our hotel...\n\nThe only thing that saved this place from the 1 star is the Fries and the Shakes.  The fries are pretty good and its bottomless.  Maybe it was the LARD it was cooked in but the fries had a unique taste.  The Vanilla Shake I had was good.  My friends had the Strawberry Shake and can attest to its goodness as well.\n\nThe best part of the Heart Attack Grill is........THE NURSES!  If it wasn't for them, I would have walked out of this place as soon as I bit into my burger.  Good Gimmick bad burger!"
1,"I. Love. Their. Horchata. It's the best I've ever had.\nTheir tacos are decent, but not to the point that I rave like everyone else. \nI'm so glad they are still in this location. I lived in Melrose for 4 years and saw 3 different restaurants in that building in that time. It's like cursed or something. Maybe it WAS cursed until America moved in? Wouldn't that be crazy?\nAnyway, the staff is friendly. I do think the portions are a bit small for the price, but she's got a following and can charge a bit more.\nI love riding my bike here, pounding down some tacos and horchata, then pedaling back home for a food come nap."
1,"I've stayed at a few hotels in Vegas and The Palazzo has to be my favorite. It's the best of every world...perfect location on the strip with easy access to the Venetian (it's connected) so you have direct access to restaurants, clubs and casinos in both hotels, not to mention access to the Venetian's many pools which is AWESOME. What can I say about the rooms? Well, all of the rooms are suites and they are just gorgeous and VERY clean. Lots of space with a comfy living area for chill out time. Can't wait to visit the Palazzo again!"
1,Rooftop.  \nFriendly service!\n$2 jello shots out of a syringe.  Best thing ever!\nBut it was pretty dead given it was a Friday night.
0,"Straight to the point their food is delicious and deserves 4 stars, but their service is awful/ disappointing. I honestly even wish their food wasn't so good. I've come in on multiple occasions and the waiter/waitresses have been so rude. On one occasion when I asked for water while I waited for my to-go the waitress with a lot of makeup on was talking badly about me in spanish. Awkward considering I understand/speak Spanish. It was to the point where I felt uncomfortable eating there. Service is slow and it's to the point where I feel I need to write this review."
0,"Nothing special. Not a great breakfast place and their Italian dinner items are bland. Went twice. Never again. On my second visit we went with another couple that had an Entertainment Book coupon. The staff wouldn't allow us to sit together and use both coupons. (Only one coupon per table, they said, although that wasn't specified on the coupon.) So our friends had to sit at a table next to us and we shouted at each other to have a conversation. Ridiculous.\n\nPlus their highly touted banana bread reeks of artificial banana flavoring, not fresh bananas; and their special potatoes (served instead of standard hash browns) are like thick, hard, and slightly greasy potato chips.\n\nI don't get the couple of enthusiastic reviews here. Perhaps they have a storied past, but for a Vegas newcomer (two months) this isn't even up to a Denny's standard."
1,"We went to Fleming's on a Saturday at 7 for our anniversary. It was a really lovely experience, though quite expensive. Parking was easy, and there were still plenty of empty tables. We were greeted and seated immediately. \n\nThey offered the regular menu and a two-course prixe fixe. My husband had steak and salmon. He likes his steak quite rare, and it came as he requested. I had scallops, which were done perfectly, and we shared the chocolate lava cake. The cake was quite good, but I've had it done better. \n\nMy husband doesn't drink, so I had wine by the glass. I like that they offer an iPad app listing wines and their descriptions, along with suggestions for menu pairings. The suggestion was spot on for my choices, and though the selection wasn't huge there was a broad selection of choices. The prices are similar to those you see in larger cities, though. \n\nOur server, Mat, was excellent. I don't know that I've had that quality of service in the Madison area before - cheerful, professional, not overbearing, perfectly timed. He pointed out that the scallops have \""a bit of a kick\"" to them, even though this is not mentioned in the description at all. Thank goodness, because spicy food sends me straight into a migraine. He made sure the kitchen left the spice out, and I was able to enjoy my night. At the end of our meal, we were presented with a box of truffles in honor of our anniversary, as well as a gift card to use for our next meal! Mat and these little extra touches are what prompted me to come on here and give a review - that sort of thing needs to be rewarded.\n\nAbout the expense - I think the food and presentation were very good. My only issue is that with places like L'Etoile in town, the menu could have been more inventive for the price, and for that reason I did not give it five stars. I know it's a steakhouse, but the food just didn't make me dream about it like I do some other places. I would recommend this place highly for a business dinner, or place to bring the less adventurous family members, and when you want your meal to be handled with New York City - level professional staff (only friendlier!). I feel like I'm damning with faint praise, and I don't mean to do that at all. It was very, very good, just not sell-a-kidney-to-eat-there good."
0,"Went here for a birthday as a party of nine. \n\nThere was really nothing special about this meal. If I had to choose a highlight, it would be the sweet potato fries, but you can get the same at a lot of fast food places. Of the party of nine, half of the group enjoyed their food, and the other half thought the flavors were nothing special or too strong. My very expensive marrow dish of some sort was very strong, which made for a good first bite, but made it impossible to finish. The restaurant is nice, but the fact that the entire restaurant runs along one of the main walkways to the casino makes it feel like it was squished in there and takes away from the ambiance. There is absolutely no value in this place. I would not recommend."
0,"My husband and I decided to try Barros pizza again after a year of eatting Grimaldis pizza. I love Barros pizza sause, and that is the only reason why I give them a 2 star rating. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza with extra sause and mushrooms on half. I drove all the way home and opened the pizza only to see that it was not my pizza. I called and was put on hold so the manager could be found. The manager came on the line and told me that she would remake the pizza. Once I got the new pizza only to see it was my original pizza. It was cold and soggy. I will not go back to barros again. Its worth it to me to pay extra for Grimaldis. At least I know my pizza will new fresh and I never receive the wrong pizza."
0,"The food was.....  unique.  Nothing like I've ever had.  So; if you're adventurous,  you might enjoy.  \n\nWe went for dim sum. We've been to many dim sum locations. Usually there are many attentive service people offering choices of delicious items.\n\n After being seated with 2 menus ( for the 4 of us) we waited and waited for someone to take our order.   Finally; after placing our menus at the edge of the table and making eye contact with the waitress multiple times we finally had to say \""OK we are ready to order\"". \n\nI noticed other people having the same troubles. \n\nThen, when we needed additional items, the girl who brought our food couldnt understand english. Salt and pepper was a chore to get. Sweet and low for mom was impossible to get.\n\nI wont be back."
1,"Lunch review.  \n\nGiven the location, Gabi could charge more.  I'd be very happy, and very tempted, if Gabi were a local establishment.  \n\nThe quiche was amazingly fluffy; it's the best quiche I've had by an immeasurable margin.  The steak sandwich was juicy and flavorful, with Stilton, caramelized onions, and chive mayonnaise.  Most importantly, the beef was pronounced and tasty.\n\nService was sluggish, despite the relatively empty dining room. \n\nHighly recommended for lunch.  Better than anything I've had in Paris."
1,"This place is by far the best for tacos! It is also open during the wee hours of the morning. Whenever a friend comes to visit I take them here. This place has amazing carne asana tacos and does not lack on quality and the spices are very flavorful. The horchata fountain drink was also amazing. Some restaurants will \""water down\"" this drink and the taste gives this away. However this place has unmatchable BOLD flavor in their drinks and tacos with reasonable pricing."
1,great BBQ great service my fav is tri tip sandwich ribs also great and love the sauces!!!
0,"It wouldn't take much to improve the atmosphere here. For starters, since it's outdoors, how about some summer flowers? Also, the metal chairs are uncomfortable -- seat pads would help. The wine selection is uninspired -- Sycamore Lane and Flip Flop -- and the food isn't great. I ordered the Mediterranean Platter and was expecting fresh cucumber slices, feta, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, hummus and olives. But it only had hummus and an artichoke dip, with pita slices and a small dish of olives. The view of the tree tops is pretty, though. And being outdoors in nice weather is always preferable to being inside."
1,"Prepare to get completely lost and to pay a bit more than you would at another Macy's anywhere else. If you can get past that, this is the ultimate in one stop shopping as far as department stores go, and you will NEVER be able to beat the selection."
1,"Its good, albeit sometimes weird pizza."
1,"My husband and I love this spot! Good wine list although I wish they had some dessert wines. The manager is so helpful with helping you choose a wine, if you don't like it she will bring you wine until you do find a glass you like!\nGet the grilled cheese and the burger!"
1,"This is the place to go for an after work Happy Hour, family feast, birthday celebrations, etc.  We go there 8 times a year for only celebrating special birthdays.  Everyone loves the food and the service is great.  Take a table or a booth, either way, the atmosphere is very nice.  Try their special appetizer platters and if you like margarita's, try their on the rocks ones, really the best in town."
0,"I love the atmosphere,  good music and happy hour.  Service not so good. Bartenders slack in customer service. Messy bathrooms with no toilet paper."
0,"It is frezzing inside and the service is terrible,gave away our order to someone else and then said it would be another 15 min and when we said no they only gave us a partial refund and made us pay for the coffee even thoug we were leaving .they need a lesson in the customer is right"
1,"This is one those \""hidden gems\"" of the valley. Since it's not a chain and it's located in central Phoenix (at Central and Missouri), A lot of people don't know about it. But for my money, it's the best Italian food in Phoenix. I first discovered Aiello's a few years back when I worked a few streets away and they catered a lunch. Since then, I've had their food several times, but a couple weeks ago I actually ate inside the restaurant for the first time. The dining room experience was wonderful. It has a very pleasant atmosphere, and almost feels more upscale than the place actually is (a TV above the bar seems a little out of place, but I won't complain about a chance to catch a game while eating). I had their special that night, which was a roasted chicken ravioli in a white sauce. My only complaint was the white sauce was unnecessary, and a traditional tomato sauce would've been fine (but I think more people are fans of white sauce than I am). All of the times I've had food from Aiello's, I've been more than satisfied. Also, If you happen to work or live by the place, I recommend trying their \""backdoor pizzeria.\"" They bake up to 50 18\"" pies a day for carry out only. My coworkers and I bought a few one time, and they were excellent."
1,Great service. Fun downtown atmosphere. Highly recommended
0,"With so many Italian restaurants competing with each other around north Scottsdale, you'd think each one would be trying pretty hard to get your business. This place wasn't. \n\nThe food and service started out OK. The bread was good. The grilled vegetable salad was pretty good, although the zucchini could have been cooked a little more.\n\nThen the meal went downhill. First, we lost our waiter to his girlfriend and her family that came in to eat at the next table. Then our food came. My calzone was composed mostly of  tasteless cheese and hardly any of the spinach, mushrooms or artichoke hearts that I added on at $1 a piece! It was bland. The side of marinara sauce was also, as was my husband's Pizza Salsa Cruda. The toppings were pretty scarce there too.\n\nI wasn't looking for a super authentic-wow-my-socks-off Italian restaurant. I was just looking for a casual sit-down close to home, not expecting too much more than Olive Garden; but this place was a total waste of money and time."
0,"I was told the burgers where great here......well last night we gave them a try.   I was not impressed.  We order two jumbo cheeseburgers one with fries, the other with onion rings.  The burgers where BURNT to a crisp.  All the favor of the meat was gone. On a good note the onion rings where great.   Please don't burn the burgers."
0,"I came here recently for lunch and thought I had walked in on a dinner theater production, or an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nI was standing in line when the owner started yelling at a customer.  At first, I thought they knew each other, but soon I realized it wasn't an act.  To make matters interesting, he then decided not to honor anothers Blimpie card -- because it was stamped from another location: \""I get nothing from this!\""  \""Go away!\""  I guess there was no sandwich for him, or soup!\n\nDuring these outbursts, some of the customers walked out in confusion.  I just took my sub and left. \n\nIn contrast, the employees all seem very nice and friendly.  But, I'll take a pass in the future and skip the drama. \n\nSorry!"
1,"The $9 Steak special is still the best deal in Las Vegas (for Slot Club Card Holders).\n\nFor the price of joining the slot club (and going through the process of going on a kiosk and getting a slip) you and anyone in your party can get a $9 steak special which includes: a cooked to order steak, choice of potato, green beans, salad, and craft brewed beer or root beer (the root beer is yummy).  This is the type of disappearing good deal on food that used to be a hallmark of Las Vegas and is disappearing.  In addition, Ellis Island also has pretty good breakfasts that range from a pretty good Steak & Eggs to good omlettes (my friend and I both had the omlettes this year).\n\nBest value in Las Vegas."
1,"Yeah, this place has true Edinburgh grit. Stopped off for a quickie on way to hotel and stayed for dinner and the friendly company. If you are wandering down Rose Street, give this place a shot."
1,"Beautiful breakfast this morning! Everything is so fresh and tempting. In the end, I went for the Bircher muesli and was not disappointed. The coffee is of a good standard as well...something I find hard to come by, having lived away from Melbourne for a year now.\nI am planning to go back for lunch at some stage during my Edinburgh visit. The sandwiches looked amazing!"
0,"Terrible Experience! My husband and I bought a Groupon for 4D Ultrasound for this office. They usually run about 100.00, so we were excited to have gotten such a deal at 35.00. We were called in from the lobby almost an hour late, which I understand some times offices can get behind. The US tech rushed us through our appointment. She had no bedside manner and was very brash in her tone. She was jabbing the US probe into my belly very hard and did not once attempt to find another angle. She spoke negatively the entire time and blamed the babies behavior for her not being able to get a decent picture. As I was about to complain how she was so rough with the US probe, the appointment was over. It lasted about 7 minutes. We left with a CD, Two printed pictures, and a sheet of photos printed from the US machine. We got one decent picture. The rest are very blurry. My husband and I were very disappointed and frustrated. What should have been a nice time for our family was instead a joke. I went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager and the lady said she would call someone, but no one came. My husband was so angry that he just wanted to leave. On our way out, we noticed another disappointed couple outside. These were the people had that gone in ahead of us. This was a really bad experience that I will be sure to share with as many people as people."
1,"Despite being MGM's biggest money pit, this place is still accommodating for guests such as ourselves, maintaining a good level of service and having very classy rooms and furniture. Staying in their suites means you get to stay inside one of the rooms they originally intended to sell as a condo, you can tell by the washer and dryer. Therefore, if you're gonna stay in Vegas for more than four days for a convention or what not, definitely try and get one of these Vdara suites. \n\nThe rooms are fairly dark; you can see they're going after a very modern feel just as with the casinos and lobbies of Aria. \n\nOur suite was pretty damned big; a bedroom with one king bed, a living room with a plasma and roll away couch, its own kitchen, and a larger than normal bathroom with a tub, stand up shower, two sinks, and a powder room counter. \n\nWe landed our suite at 180 a night, thanks to Priceline. It's one heck of a bargain, and I think you can consistently land this hotel on that site, as well!"
0,"Don't ever go here.   The oysters were slimy & didn't taste fresh, the mixed drinks were basically non alcoholic which I expect in the store front places but this is not a cheap restaurant.  To top it all off the waiter was a snob & not friendly at all, in Harrahs I wouldn't expect snobby waiters.   Save your money & go anywhere else."
1,"Best place around to watch a mainstream movie.\n\nThe prices are reasonable considering the costs movie theaters pay now to lease the prints. Harkins still has a reasonable matinee price and even a movie that starts at 5:00 qualifies as a matinee. The concessions prices are, of course, outrageous. In case you don't know anything about the theater business, this is how they make virtually all of their money. They don't make anything from ticket sales.\n\nThe theaters are pretty comfortable, and we have always preferred them to AMC because of the reclining chairs. They do a pretty good job cleaning the theaters between shows as well--there is very rarely any visible mess in the theater from the last show.\n\nMy only complaint is that they really need to get on some schedule of steam cleaning the seats. Maybe they do this already, but they need to do it more often. The seats get pretty funky with spills, stains, etc. after a while."
1,"this buffet definitely has a lot of variety.  i thought it would never end haha.  best part is unlimited drinks!  wine/beer included.\n\nit's about 30 minutes from the strip, and $36 plus change for the meal.  guess they just started this last saturday, but...\n\nTIP: if you go on SATURDAY get a player's card (free) and get a buy one get one free meal!"
1,"Sports Chalet is the most complete sporting goods and outdoor store I have ever seen. They have a vast selection of sports equipment and exercise gear. Their Mountain Shop has a very good selection of climbing and camping gear. Although the gear section is not as extensive as REI, the prices are slightly better. And they do SCUBA. \n\nI took my PADI course through a dive shop before I found out about Sport's Chalet's prices. They are FAR less expensive than any dive shop in the valley when it comes to the PADI open water certification courses and dives. The dive instructor at the Tempe store, Dan, leads the dive classes and is highly competent. (I give the dive program five stars)."
1,"While planning our wedding, we realized that we had a bunch of out of town people coming to Phoenix who have either never been here or have only spent limited time in phoenix. We already had our venue for our reception (in downtown also), and we wanted to get a cool hotel for us to stay at that was close. It was between the new Sheraton or the Wyndham, the Sheraton is a very nice hotel also but WAY too overpriced. \n\nWe decided to take a shot in the dark and see if we could get a group rate so that anyone coming from out of town could book a room at a discounted rate. We got in touch with someone there and were able to give us $99 rooms with the wedding couple (us) getting a jr suite for the same price. \n\nThe people there were super friendly and helpful, they even let us take a tour of the room to see what they were like. They were also very accommodating, they even delivered gift bags for us. \n\nI read a lot of the reviews about the hotel and didn't have any of the problems that they did. Yes the halls aren't updated yet like the rooms, but they aren't gross, just a little outdated, and I'm sure they are still working on it. I didn't hear any noise from any other rooms. They only problem I had was that when I left my room, the door would slam shut and THAT was really loud, it didn't bother me but just made me feel bad in case I woke somebody up with it. \n\nOverall it was really cool to stay in this hotel, it made it an even better night for everyone I think they all like the hotel."
0,"I brought in my truck and all my exhaust parts needed to the shop after calling and talking to Russ and he said it was fine, they didnt have much business that day. I talked to Russ and after 4 hours it was done. The entire time I could hear the conversations the mechanics were having in the back, some of which pertained to customers that had just walked in and they were making fun of an elderly woman with dyslexia. Within one minute of driving away my truck clutch goes out. I look under and notice a line had melted to my exhaust they just installed! I called them and they said \"" sorry can't help we didnt touch your clutch.\"" I then had it towed to Meineke for another $150 and they said my clutch had gone out because they never moved the hydraulic line when installing the exhaust. I called performance muffler and all they said theyd do would be to pay for the line since the OWNER remwmbers seeing the line just not knowing what it was... well now that I'm in the hole $1500 for towimg, the hydraulic line, clutch, and slave cylinder. After 3 weeks I'm still talking with the bbb, for the companys name being professional, there service isn't. DO NOT GO!  i had broken down one mile from their shop, 2 minutes after leaving. I spent all my money from deploying to afghanistan for this one project and they put me in the hole $1500 because Russ admitted he was \""in a hurry.\"" I would also like for them to keep their voices down so customers can't hear when they are bashing them in the back. My grandmother has dyslexia and I didnt find what they were saying to be humorous. After all the reviews and positive things people said about this company, I can't believe this is the type of stuff id experience at such a \""professional\"" shop."
0,"I have been in this store quite a few times lately,and cannot believe how bad the customer service is!! It's just unbelievable! I don't know where they find there people,but no wonder there not very busy for such a big store! And there selection sucks! Went to go buy a goose call and they had ONE goose call in the whole store and a whole aisle of goose decoys ummm...I asked the check out person to staple my receipts together and he said they did not have a stapler (but they did two days before that) I said he did and told ME to go to another lane to get it!!   \nDo not shop at this store!!"
0,"I really wanted to like this place.  I consider myself somewhat of a cupcake connoisseur.  Every time I visit a new place that has a cupcake bakery, I try my best to visit it and try a few.  I'm also a home baker, and I make a mean cupcake.  To put it plainly, I know what cupcakes should taste like.\n\nUnfortunately, they should not taste like the stuff that Cake Cafe puts out.  We stopped by one day after seeing a sign on a sidewalk with balloons attached.  After debating for about two seconds over getting cupcakes, we pulled into the parking lot.  Walking in was not a pleasant experience.  The decor reminds me of a twelve year old pre-pubescent girl.  Not a good thing.  There are way too many non-cupcake related cheap gifts cluttering the right side of the decent sized bakery.  \n\nI ordered a peanut butter chocolate cupcake, my usual, and the husband ordered a chocolate mint cupcake.  My chocolate cake was dry and tasted off.  Other reviewers suggest that this is because they used cake mix, and I have to agree. That's probably it. The frosting however, I liked because it was super sweet and peanut buttery. The grainy texture was a little irritating, but the flavor was still good. Opponents of super sweet will not enjoy these. The husband also had a chocolate cake and the accompanying \""off\"" taste. He also wasn't sure if the mint was in the cake as well as in the frosting. He enjoyed the frosting but remembered the far superior cupcakes we had enjoyed at Yummy Cupcakes in California previously.\n\nI may go back here.  It's hard to resist a cupcake when you don't have to make it yourself.  Maybe they were having a bad day when I went.  I am willing to give them a second try.  Cake Cafe, please don't let me down."
0,"Worst marketing in the city. Standing on street corners downtown, verbally harassing pedestrians and littering their pornographic \""advertisements\"" all over town. I don't have a problem with nudity, I have a problem with the cards being accessible to small children- so inappropriate. \n\nThese promoters are annoying as hell, disrespectful, and know no boundaries. If I don't make eye contact, here's an idea: leave me alone. That is not a coy way of inviting you to follow me down the street ten yards and toss papers at my retreating back."
1,"What a great Happy Hour!\n\nWe stopped in at 5 on a Friday and it was jammed.  The hostesses were very gracious and gave us a nice table since the bar was jammed. The crowd was loud, stylish and very friendly.\n\nWe ordered four appetizers, all of which were excellent.  The two most noteworthy were the crab cake which was both huge and just incredibly delicious and an unbelievable steal at $6.00 and the chopped salad that was so big the waiter had to split it onto two plates.  Again, about $6.00. We had some ahi sashimi thing that was very nice and a shrimp cocktail that was the least impressive of the lot.  \n\nThe drinks were excellent and the service was outstanding : professional, quick and very friendly.\n\nVery nice selection of wines by the glass too.\n\nWe rolled out of there stuffed and very satisfied with the entire experience.  Can't wait to go back for dinner.  Highly recommended!"
0,"Someone suggested that because of my incident at your eastern location this morning, I should tell what happened to me this morning. I ordered the the classic today and there was a ROCK in my work potatoes. Luckily I saw it before I took a bite of my food. My husband and I were completely shocked! I showed it to the server and all she chose to do was have my order redone. Meanwhile my husband was completely done by the time I got my second plate. I also had to ask twice for my muffin that came with my meal. Needless to say, it was extremely disappointing breakfast date!"
0,"Employees seemed nice, however the imax was not worth it. The theater was normal and it felt like they just threw on the imax sticker for the extra bucks. Will not be returning unless they renovate the imax. \nEdit: Way too many loud high school kids."
1,"Huge plates.  Great service.  Fried chicken and waffles are the best\nEvery meal serves 2-3 so DON\""T order 1 entr\u00e9e per person unless you eat for free at the Heart Attack Grill!"
1,"So I was out in Scottsdale early on a Thursday night.. where to go? Well we just wanted to be drinking, so I looked up dive bars on Yelp (this being Old Town Scottsdale I didn't expect anything wonderful). Well I was surprised when we ended up at DJ's.\n\nThe guy at the door was half way through Braveheart, so that should tell you pretty much all you need to know about the place. There were about 4 people in the whole bar, a sad little Marlboro dispenser with a tv screen that kept playing ads with cowboys on horses - hello how sad for someone that wants a cigg at the bar! It must be torture for some people.\n  \nThey had a few HDTVs playing golf, so you could see each drop of sweat on Tiger Wood's face - literally you could! I don't really enjoy such things.\n\nWell I ordered a Cran Vodka, and it was standard fair... you know with the cranberry juice, that is unnaturally red... like Hawaiian Punch brand red. Well it was decent, not too strong but not weak I suppose. Then after having been whining earlier about how I couldn't do shots, I did one of Absolute LA. I had wanted to try it since I love Acia. But I usually hate flavored vodka, even blueberry, so it could have been awful. But it wasn't, especially since the bartender shook it in ice before hand.\n\nOverall, we got drunk and they didn't charge us an arm or a leg! A great save, thank you mobile Yelp."
0,WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example.
1,"Luv it, luv it, luv it!\nGreat value, rooms well equipped and modern, having a frig is huge on the strip.  Front desk was top notch, as was the security near the elavator.  Relaxing pool.  Can't say enough, will definitely stay there again!"
1,"We went to our first show at the Orpheum Theatre last night.\n\nI thought the theater was absolutely beautiful. I loved the intricate architecture. It felt old but stately. It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well. \n\n We saw Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. So beautiful, stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really highlighted his performance.\n\nI found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. They brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)\n\nNow it's just wonderful. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. Can't wait to head back!"
0,"I'm sorry to agree with everybody's comment here, it's by far the worst drive thru experience I've ever had in my entire McDonald fan!!   I ordered choc chip frappe and 2apple pie; when I got to the window to pick up my order (which took 35mins) I was asked if it is ok to not have a choc chip in it because they ran out?  What?Really?They should have said that 30mins ago so I could have left and not waste time waiting for me paying full price for half service?? You joking right?If there's zero negative star on here, they'll get it!"
0,"This was my first time here.  I tried the chicken salad sandwich.  The sandwich was very bland and terribly depressing.  I can't believe it.  I was so excited to try this place, especially after reading some of the reviews about the location on State St.  Wrong sir wrong!!  The interior of this location was pretty darn cool and comfy, and the staff was very friendly, but the sandwich reminded me of something you'd get out of a hospital cafeteria.  Blech.  \n\nCraptacular."
0,"Ate here with a $25 gift card from my boyfriends work. We didn't come with any high expectations, other than a free meal.\n\nI knew there weren't going to be many vegetarian entree options, but there were NONE. Oh man, so insert the part where I have to look like a total jerk asking for a frankenstein-style salad with no meat, while the waiter looks at me like I'm crazy when I ask him which dressing is the best.\n\nThe salad was boring and small and overpriced, but it was edible.\n\nWe ordered a Bloomin' Onion for an appetizer. It was actually pretty tasty at first (or maybe I was just ravenous), but the more I ate, the more I could feel my mouth, face, and fingers getting soaked in oil. Ugh.\n\nI left the restaurant feeling kind of gross, but at least the facility was clean and the staff were polite."
0,"I wish there was an option for ZERO stars. Seriously the WORST post office ever. This is the third time this month this has happened so I thought I'd leave a review. We live in a condo with a normal address and for some reason our postman/woman has sent back THREE packages to the original place we ordered from for \""incomplete address\"". Probably because they are too lazy to walk it into the office. Never had this problem before. And had to pay for shipping again due to our mail person being a lemming.\n\nUPDATE: 2 weeks later and they have lost ANOTHER package. Why am I not surprised?!"
1,Great atmosphere and the service was excellent.  The food and drinks were excellent.  Great spot to go to for happy hour.
0,"Don't rent from Dakota / Mark Taylor co.\nThe pool and the area around it are dirty, bathrooms next to pool are rarely clean\ncross your fingers when requesting maintenance, 50/50 chance it will be fixed on first visit. ac units are old suck electricity big time. windows are all single pane cheap crap.\nstove and fridge are probably 15 years old . washer / dryer routinely break down then in maybe 3 days if your lucky you will get a used one as a replacement that might last a few weeks if your lucky. repeat maintenance call omg.. There is better places out there keep looking."
1,My younger child took his first classes there this week. He had an absolute blast! Both instructors (both named Emily) were great with my child.
0,"This is not going to be a fair review. Upfront.\n\nI visited the Margaritaville Cafe on 2/14/11. Apparently someone had \""bought-out\"" the first two floors leaving only the roof-top bar available.\n\nThe line for the roof-top bar started at the top of the stairs and proceed down a hall toward what appeared to be a bus area/kitchen. The stench of stewing garbage in the hallway was over powering. About 20-30 people waited in this line. After 15 minutes, the line didn't move and the same two guys at the front were still there.\n\nWe left. Probably never coming back. Management needed to be doing some damage control and wasn't. It probably would have been tolerable if someone tried to get a couple of drink orders for the line."
0,Not impressed by Fremont. It's just a bunch of casino's and souvenir shops. It's so small too. the zip lining was shut down which is what we went for.\n\nI rather just walk down the strip and not feel so damn claustrophobic.
0,"The food was excellent and the service was superb ... until we got our bill. We were double-charged for the duck dinner (most expensive on menu). When the waiter came to pick up the check, I handed him the receipt and simply said \""You need to check this again\"". I did not tell him what was wrong with the check; he didn't even look at the receipt and immediately said \""Oh, I'll remove one of the duck dinners\"". He had no more eye-contact.\nI truely believe this waiter was deliberately trying to rip us off. We are above-average tippers, and this is a high-end restaurant. He did not need to do it. I went to the restroom to cool off, I was so annoyed. \nI should have said something to the manager, but I don't want to get people fired."
1,"I tried this place for the first time today. I heard about it from a flyer left on my car. I had always gone to spring moutain to get really good Pho, but I was excited to see this place on our side of town. I tried a couple of items, the shrimp rolls in rice paper were wonderful and fresh and I loved the peanut sauce. There was also a selection of different types of non-alcoholic drinks meant to referesh the palate. I tried the ginger iced tea lemonade and it was wonderful I had never had anything like it and can't wait to have it again. I had the special PHO with the satay and it was yummy, a nice spice but not too spicy. The prices were very reasonable and everything was fresh. I can't wait to go back and try the other items."
1,"We went here last week for a Yelp Elite event and it was so amazing, so since we lived right down the road, I thought I would take my husband back for dinner after shopping with me all day!  We went in and it was suprisingly crowded for a Sunday.  We sat at the bar and our bartender Jasmine was so welcoming and sweet!  We started with the appetizer sampler and it came with stuffed shrooms, chicken roll up things, and fried shrimp.  It was all delicious but I think the mushrooms were my favorite!  We then moved to the wedge salad, which is delicioussss!  Their blue cheese is home made and you can tell a huge difference!  \n\nTheir steaks are delicious and seasoned wonderfully.  I also had a nice glass of cab with dinner (and extra 2 dollars and you can get 3 more ounces!)  Overall it was a wonderful dinner and Jasmine enhanced our whole experience.  With her adorable southern accent and her professional attitude while dealing with a....difficult customer...A really great steakhouse option that is close by and really making a splash in the Matthews area."
0,"SHC has the best, cleanest ER BUT if you get submitted to the hospital, it's the worst hospital ever!! \n\nI won't bore you with the many complaints I had during my stay, but if you can avoid being submitted to this hospital, do whatever you can. Going back when I was being taken to the ER, I would have taken a longer trip if that meant I could have stayed at a better hospital. So just ONE of the BAJILLION complaints I have about this hospital is...\n\nThey are under staffed and the nurses are witches. After my surgery I had to pee (sorry if that's TMI) but I couldn't get to the bathroom on my own so I paged a nurse. NO ONE came around for an HOUR. Towards the end of that hour I was paging the nurses every two seconds. Still nada. \n\nFinally, I grabbed my cell phone, called 411 and had them connect me with the hospital, I spoke with a receptionist and had to ask her if someone would please come to my room to help me. It was after that a nurse actually came to help me. Can you believe that??\n\nThere are a lot of elderly people in this part of town too and they probably would have just been left there to crap all over themselves or been ignored. If you have a grandparent or know an older person staying here, get them transferred.\n\nother issues in the eyes of someone on pain meds:\n-they didn't toast my bagel and it made me cry. through tears i said to my sister, 'they didn't toast my bagel!!!' and then i'm pretty sure i through it on the floor. but that parts a bit blurry. \n- they didn't knock before barging into my room in the middle of the night, which scared me and made me cry. through tears i said, 'can you please knock??!!'\n\nissues not related to pain meds:\n- you have to share a room. yuck. my roommate was a farter.\n- the nurses are evil. they don't pay attention to the needles and tubes INSIDE of your SKIN when they go to take your blood pressure!! imagine having those ripped out of your arm bc the nurse isn't paying attention\n-in order to leave they make the head dr or nurse or something check you out. we waited 6 hours waiting for the nurse person while the nurses kept telling us to hold on, it should be soon. and then we found out it wasn't necessary and they finally let us leave. \n- the nurses argue. see conversation below:\n\""samantha- are you in pain? do you need more pain meds?'\n'yes'\n'you must not be in pain if you're sleeping'\n'i'm not asleep'\n'your eyes are closed'\n'ummm, i'm responding aren't i? i'm not asleep'\n'well if you were in pain it would be impossible for you to lay here calmly'\n'can you please stop arguing with me? i am in pain so please stop arguing with me'"
1,"I. FREAKIN. LOVE. PANERA.\n\nI loved Panera since they first started springing up in my old hometown in New York and was psyched that I would have one so close to our new place here in Charlotte.  Funny enough, it took us almost five months to finally stop in.  This location follows suite with all the others, but the service was incredibly friendly!\n\nI always go for the take two option and went for the summer corn chowder and a half turkey sandwich.  What a great deal for less than $9!  The food always tastes fresh and healthy.  My husband, who's never really ate at Panera much, agreed that it was worth coming back for lunch.\n\nMy only sadness was that I didn't realize that you could add on a dessert for .99 to any meal until we were on our way out.  I wish that were more prominently displayed, otherwise I definitely would have taken advantage of it!"
1,"It was Christmas Eve 2010 and of course, we were having company. My sister took me to this place.  \n1. It was busy ( that's a good sign).\n2. staff was friendly \n3. the place is beautiful inside. It's very  relaxing. \n\n I think  we sat down about 15 minutes. We did not mind waiting as it was a holiday.  They called my name. I don't remember the lady that did my eyebrows, but I will next time! I looked good. I was like, OH YEAH!!   \n  For my eyebrows it was $11 . Just a dollar more than what I usually pay and i put money in the tip jar. It was worth it, and so inexpensive for me .  I feel confident and will be going back either this weekend or the next! \n oh yes, and they do take cards, however I'd rather give cash. :)\n\nEDIT UPDATE Nov. 30,2012 : I Still go to this place every 2 weeks or every month depending on funds. Meena does my eyebrows each time and she's amazing. (she does not work on Mondays).  I always look fantastic when I come out and  they service me very quickly. Everything is still nice and neat, service is outstanding, and usually, you are in and out in 15-20 minutes tops."
0,"Really, the only redeeming quality of this garbage airport is the free wi-fi. It gets two stars for that, and that's it.\n\nThe place is huge and it doesn't have any sort of rapid transit to navigate the place. There are just tons of long hallways and those stupid flat escalator things (their name is escaping me, and I'm really tired/pissed at airports right now). We arrived at 9pm and every damn restaurant in the place was closed, so I had to settle for a crappy bag of peanuts for dinner. BLASPHEMY!\n\nThe entire time I was here (2 hours, maybe), I felt like I was in the coldest, most boring, deserted hallway where you could hear a pin drop from miles away; and the airport literally feels like it is miles long."
1,"Lovely experience here tonight! Service was wonderful and was complimented by getting to meet the owner, Lindsey. She and her husband took it over from his family recently (not exactly sure when) to continue the family tradition. Food was tasty - I had pesto pasta and husband had garlic pizza plus a French onion soup and bruschetta. Atmosphere was quite nice on the patio and we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine that was reasonably priced. We had the privilege of talking with Lindsay further and learning about their takeover after getting a summary from the menus which include an overview on key individuals in the history of Bread company, including Lindsay and the original owner, her mother in law."
1,"Best BBQ (pulled pork) we ever had!!!!!\n\nSeveral times a year we head to Charlotte.  Upon arrival at Charlotte Douglas airport, we get our rental car and head to a BBQ restaurant.  We've tried a number of them and this time we were intrigued by what we had read about Sauceman's -- 228 West Blvd.  Oh man, the reviews could not do justice to the deliciousness ( think I made that word up!!!) to the pulled pork BBQ, sauce, mac & cheese, greens and yummy hush puppies.  Oh my gosh, it was out of this world.  We have no need to continue exploring the BBQ restaurants -- we have found our little slice of heaven.  Now if we only lived closer........."
0,"Just left after getting \""The Works\"" car wash. There are water spots all over my windows. The \""vacuum\"" job was not at all good-can't really tell they vacuumed at all.\n\nIs this how they treat people with Groupons? I'd give negative stars if I could.\n\nReally don't want to go back with the remaining two Groupons...."
0,"Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked \""Do I want that to go?\"" Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?"
0,"The upgrade to 2.0 failed. The breakfast  is unremarkable, as is the ambiance."
1,"I recently had an emergency trip I needed to take.  As I was going home to pack I noticed I was getting a flat tire.  I stopped at our local Big O, told them my situation and they had me on my way in under 30 minutes, at zero cost.  It was a FANTASTIC service."
1,"This place is really neat! The food was good, my grilled wings were slightly over cooked but my boyfriend's grilled cheese burger was super tasty! They have a great happy hour and boyfriend loves bourbon. They have some great selections from local distilleries and they have $3 bourbons during happy hour on Wed! We will be sure to check this place out again soon."
0,"The service was ok, but the food was disappointing. Food was very bland and did not have much flavor. I've been to other Japanese restaurants wayy better than this one."
0,Bad customer service. They got my order wrong then they started talking about me in Spanish not realizing that I speak Spanish. $7 burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito. I've lived in El Mirage for the past 14 years and have been coming to this spot and the one on thunderbird for years. This was definitely the last time.
1,The food is great ! The workers here are so friendly.. I go here on a daily basis just to enjoy my day :]
0,"Used to come here to rent one of the electric boats and go for a cruise on the lake... Unfortunately the company In Charge has not invested in keeping the boats up to date and the whole place looks terrible... The boats need major repairs the upholstery in all boats are either torn, ripped  or dirty food stains? The radios are all broken, the one we rented had no working gauges so you don't even know if the battery is charged.\nFor$65 an hour? I expected something way better."
1,"Bought a house and immediately noticed spider webs and crickets all around. Decided to go with these guys when I received a post-card in the mail for $39 for inside and outside. \nThey gave me the time frame of 2-5pm, which sounded awful to be waiting around for 3 hours. But the technician showed up right at 2pm, I was pleasantly surprised. \nHe explained to me exactly what he was using and what it was for and also helped clarify what I was seeing. \nHe was in and out in about 30minutes or less. Very polite. Received a call a day later to check and see how the service was. Then received a letter in the mail with another deal for the full year. \nOnly down-side is the treatment only lasts about 30days where others last about 60 days. But they do offer a 21 day guarantee-if we see bugs return they will come out again. \nOverall I'm pleased."
0,"Service was good... The food taste terrible, feels like the boiling pot in LA, but taste totally different. I ordered the spicy pot, the super spicy one, it's not spicy at all...disoppionted"
1,"Had lunch today...My lunch pal had the BLTA and I had the SW Chicken Wrap.  Thank you so much for using a quality tortilla and not some flavored one that has so much preservative on it that it tastes like wax!!  The chicken had VERY good flavor and it was a good size.  I got the side salad with it and while I feel they were a bit skimpy with the salad, it was still good.  The fries were very tasty!  Crispy and flavorful.  Loved the decor too!  This place beats the heck out of Kneaders.....I am happy to pay $8 for a lunch I am going to like!"
1,"These guys are awesome! They had to move me twice in one month which was a feat, considering my hoarding tendencies. They packed and moved it all quickly and with smiles on their faces. They are super friendly and professional, plus their prices are great. They didn't even complain about the plethora of dog and cat hair that starting whirling around the house once they moved my furniture. I would recommend them to anyone! In fact, I will be moving again in a few weeks (hopefully for the last time) and I would love for them to come out here to California and do it!"
0,"I am basing this rating solely on the service, despite the food being great. Our server was so unpleasant that made us believe that we were on a hidden camera show.\n\n The horrible attitude and random pacing of our food was tolerable until we inquired about two sushi rolls my husband had ordered.  Our server admitted one of the rolls was never made without so much as an apology and then insisted that he had delivered and seen the second roll being eaten and would produce the empty plate.  We had ordered over $120 worth of food and found it odd that he would vehemently insist we were trying to get away with a $7 sushi roll!!  Management offered compensation for our horrible experience, but we declined.\n\nOne bad apple ruined the bunch. Sorry Soul we will not be returning."
0,Came here wit high expectations non of which were meant...  This is one of the spots where the hype killed it. Food was blah and that was not a typo.  No wow factor here..  Flavorless and bland for most of the steam buns which the ratio of protein to veggies way off.  And the all famous duck leg....  This was the worse part of our meal..  Picture a cold tough and unseasoned duck leg smothered with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce..  Other than that the tacky Yusho t-shirts are also something to giggle at..  It isn't Easter anymore fellas.. Very disappointing...
1,"My husband's family took us to a concert at the Jobing.com arena. We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.\n\nWhile the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)\n\nAs for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!\n\nI would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour."
0,Terrible selection and the employees don't know jack about what they sell. Also it's just about as overpriced as it can get. Just go to dick blik or arron brothers. Just anywhere but here.
0,"This place was great about 2 years ago but clearly things have changed. \n\nYesterday on my lunch break I was craving Carne Fries. I ordered them with NO guacamole, ADD extra cheese. I was charged for the cheese too because the total was $10 something. \nI get back to my cube at work only to find that the fries were smothered in guacamole with a less than normal amount of cheese. The carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy.\nNot to mention the cashier was a tad bit cranky AND she never advised me of the fee to use my debit card. \n\nSorry Vaqueros but I don't think I'll be coming back."
0,"My rate is based on quantity, not quality.\n\nWe ordered carryout for dinner and for 3 adults ordered 3 specialty rolls and one regular roll. We were charged $50 and recieved the food and were incredibly disappointed with the size of the specialty rolls. When I called I had asked about the size and the hostess assured me that the specialty rolls were 8pcs and much more filled. Maybe it is because we had carryout but it was nowhere near enough food to feed 3 adults for dinner and we were not going to pay more. We went back with our food and explained our disappointment and they kindly refunded us our money, although, wouldn't you have thought they would stand by their food and try to make us happy by giving us more food to try? At least then there would be a chance of us going back if we liked the food! I am by no means a food or sushi snob but I like to be filled when I eat. We decided to try Simplee Sushi down the road and got more for our money and the rolls were larger as well. She even included 3 free soups!  Will be hesitant to go back to Wild East and will never carryout again."
1,"This is the best Asian buffet I have been to and it is one of the best buffets period. The sushi was fresh and appealing. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. I wanted to try everything, but there was too much to choose from.The $22 price seemed a little steep, but the quality made up for it. We did not even have the crab or prime rib which is a dinner only item. I will return, but for lunch most likely. With the Yelp check in, I received a 20% discount."
1,I'm not even Vegitarian and I dig this place. Went there with a friend and was pleasently suprised. The ice cream is great! Cool vibe.
1,"Awesome!  Great place to people watch, meet new people and have fun.  Great staff!"
0,"I had dinner with some co-workers here last week.  This seems to be a good place to grab a few beers, watch sports and or ride the mechanical bull.  However,  I am not sure I understand the d\u00e9cor as I can't tie the theme together in my mind.  With respect to the food, I would not eat here again.  We had a large group so the $5 appetizers were popular because we knew our entrees would take awhile.   The sweet n spicy calamari was okay but they smothered it in sauce leaving the breading soggy.  I had their sirloin steak with green beans and mashed potatoes. The steak didn't have much flavor so the demi sauce that came with it was quickly used up.  The pile of green beans was limp and the mashed potatoes had too much white pepper in them.  The dinner was so unimpressive; I did not finish it and came home for a Pb & J.  I was also confused by why they have an attendant in the men's room.  So, I don't have a buzz, didn't enjoy my dinner and now I feel like I have to tip a guy for handing me a couple of c-fold towels.  I don't plan on being back on the ranch anytime soon.  I would give them a one star rating but the girl who waited on our group did a good job."
1,"What a cool place! I was hesitant in going at first.  However, my hesitation was almost immediately put to ease!  From the moment we walked in we were met with smiles and wonderful customer service. Not to mention the great interior design of the place.  We had a delicious dinner accompanied by tasty drinks (the bar tender definitely was not stingy on the alcohol) and with happy hour prices all night long our wallets weren't hurting either.  After dinner we spent the rest of the evening in the VIP lounge.  It was really busy with lots of younger kids, so it was nice to have a separate, more quite area to bowl and hang out.  I would absolutely recommend going to Uptown Alley and look forward to my next visit!!"
1,Amazing Pizza!
1,"Absolutely amazing place to eat all the fried food in Vegas and with glutton free, there is no way anyone is getting fat or getting that nasty greasy food in you! Especially here, it is healthy and yet delicious to enjoy all your favorite fishy food out there!\n\nThe moment you wait in land for this craving of yummy fishes, it quinces your thirst with mouth watering aroma smell!\n\nGo there and Enjoy!"
1,Nice Staff...Nice Tatt. Thanks guys for making my last one a good one.
0,"We used to love this place but the service has gotten horrible as of late. We left after 20 minutes of no service last time, and our previous visit the service was very slow too.\n\nThe food is still good, but gone is the good service. Expect empty drink glasses and long wait times these days. Too bad, but even after discussing it with the owner it doesn't appear to change as he was quite unapologetic about it."
0,"I heard about this restaurant when I lived in Memphis and was very excited to find one in Arizona while we were visiting. Unfortunately my expectations were far from reality. Our waitress was rude from beginning, she only made eye contact with the men at the table and even neglected to enter one of our orders. Three dinner entrees arrived 25 minutes later when we had ordered dinners for four. The fourth entree was delivered to our table about another 20 minutes later after everyone else had already finished their meals. The waitress failed to apologize and the manager gave a subpar apology. The food quality was not worth the wait or the horrible service. The only positive things about this visit were the cocktails and the very nice hostess staff."
0,"I would prefer not to eat here again.  'Too bad it's right next door to my office building, so out of convenience and variety, I probably WILL eat here again.  :-(  I find the food over-priced for being so bland.  The sandwiches are stuffed with massive quantities of over-processed, sliced meat product, and so you can't really taste the rest of the sandwich ingredients.  The cookies are pretty decent, and the service is attentive.  Since I hate the burned taste of coffee, I can't speak to those products, nor to their soups."
1,"i have been eating there almost every day at lunch for the past year. Cheap delicious mexican food. Dont be discouraged by the line up at lunch hour, you rarely wait more than 10 minutes to get your food.\n\nWeird fact: They train a new waitress almost every day. Not sure what that's all about!"
0,"I wanted some Korean BBQ in Las Vegas, and went to this restaurant for dinner.  The decor was very nice with stone, wood and artwork, and the service was very good (albeit the restaurant was mostly empty on a Tuesday night).  However, the food just wasn't that good.  \n\nI had the Dak Bulgogi (Chicken) and am used to the very well marinated meats in Korean BBQ restaurants in Los Angeles, etc.  However this chicken just wasn't flavored well, and was pretty bland.  With the large number of Asian restaurants in the \""Chinatown\"" section just west of the strip across the I-10 I was surprised that this was one of the most heralded restaurants."
1,"Brought my Swatch in for a band repair. They cleaned the face and I bought a new watch for my wife as well. The people were awesome, helpful and it was the best customer service I have had in a long time. Love this place."
0,"Went in with my son for a coffee and quick bite at around 9:30am. The cashier forgot that we had ordered a hot sandwich and I had to remind her to get it started. It wasn't busy at all, we were the only people in line! I don't think she said two words to us while taking our order. I basically could have used one of those iPad ordering tablets like Panera is using for all the good the cashier did. Totally not helpful!! I ordered a danish and a croissant which she did not offer to warm up, she did not ask my name for the order or even look at us while we were ordering. Basically a super bad experience compared to other Starbucks in Charlotte."
1,"This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \n\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \n\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \n\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.\n\nI was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect. \n\nBetween Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!"

1,Best Vietnamese food in it's price class for the Phoenix Valley.
0,"I will never come back here. They couldn't understand how to make a Mocha Frappe with Hazelnut flavor. Once that was finally figured out, I overheard that they had spilled my drink dumping half the contents out. I saw them pick up the cup and used the same cup to remake my drink, when I asked for a new drink in a clean cup, the shift supervisor got huffy about it, angrily grabbed my drink threw it hastily in the trash can and made me a new drink in a clean cup finally. \n\nAlthough they did give me a card that says they were sorry I had a bad experience enjoy a beverage on us, that didn't excuse the bad customer service and possible health violation of serving a drink in a dirty cup. \n\nThis Starbucks was very packed and very poorly ran. I would expect more out of a place like this and would assume anyone else would have wanted a clean cup as well."
1,Went here last night with coworkers.  Great happy hour prices.  Nice atmosphere.  Definitely a chill casual sports bar feel. Just got bar food but it was good.  Looking forward to going back for poker or trivia.
0,"I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10. \n\nAfter reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away."
1,Love their carne asada tacos! We have never had anything but great quick service and good food from mi casita. One of the workers was telling me they will probably close down when their lease is up and I truly hope they don't.
0,Wir haben hier drei N\u00e4chte verbracht. Das Zimmer war gro\u00df und das Bett auch Doppelbett!!! Aber da Bad war winzig klein. Man konnte sich kaum drehen. Und es gibt keinen K\u00fchlschrank!!!

1,"My go to place after Bikram Yoga!  The price is quite reasonable and the staff are always pleasant.  They are very efficient too.  There are stools there for customers to sit, read a magazine while they wait for their smoothies.  \n\nI like the fact that they have \""Dessert Companion\"" issue.  I usually grabbed one before I go.  My favorite drink is the Berry Upbeet.  It has many awesome goodness in this one blended concoction.  Earl's favorite is the Apple 'n Greens.  The next one I want to try is the Orange Carrot Karma.  \n\nCan't go wrong with any of their smoothies though...I am a fan!"
1,"Great food! I was in Charlotte for a small day-conference and we dropped in. I ordered the shredded chicken taco salad as I usually do at mexican restaurants. I have no complaints about this place. If you're in town, try it!"
1,"I don't even normally LIKE philly cheese steaks- but the sandwiches here are AMAZING! They put cheez whiz on them. WHAT?! I know, sounds completely revolting, right? Turns out it isn't. I though cheez whiz was E-Z Cheez. Nope, it is something completely different. Combine that with the grilled onions, and perfectly grilled steak chunks? Hello taste bud meltdown experience.  \n\nAnd the Cheez Whiz fries with grilled onions? HOLY Mother of God are those GOOOOOD! I don't even want to take a guess on what the caloric intake is on either- but if you don't care, or only want to eat once that week anyway- take a trip to Corleone's. You won't regret it. (Well, you may if you don't wear your stretchy pants when you go)"
0,"Never really have been to impressed with this place.  I haven't really felt compelled to write a review for this place until last night when we paid $30 for a barely cooked pizza that we couldn't even finish.  There's plenty of great places to get pizza in Pittsburgh.  This is good for drunk denizens of Shadyside and dopey Duquesne frat boys from the Southside.  If you're going to spend this kind of money for good pizza, make the trip to Squirrel Hill."
1,"The Marksman Bar is very much an old traditional Leith Pub which is full of characters . In the Best Bar None awards they have taken a Silver Award for the last three years which I can assure you is very difficult to achieve. The charity work that is done in this wee small community bar is amazing, so much so that the licensee of the premises won the Unsung Hero Scottish Licensing Award in November 2013. Some of the customers look rough and ready but you should NEVER NEVER  judge a book by its cover, they are actually Rough Diamonds. There is always a warm welcome to strangers.  It is a small pub, spotlessly clean, with very reasonable prices."
0,"Food...BOMB! Everything they do in the kitchen, they do right.\nMusic is good and usually pretty loud..\nBring a group of people and sit at the bar. This is where you'll get served the fastest..servers make themselves scarce and don't talk much.\n It's worth a trip, for fried pickles!"
0,Was it a bad day or is it crazy\nI had a groupon certificate for 18.00 value. I had called and asked what they had going on that night. They told me an extra large one topping and get a small cheese free. I had ordered it and went to pick it up I paid the difference with my certificate and took home a great set of pizzas. A few weeks later my girlfriend gave me her certificate for the same place. When I called he looked up my number and saw the deal I had before. I repeated the order and went to pick it up. When I got there I gave the owner the certificate same as lat time and that is when things went wrong. He said that I had to pay for the cheese pizza. I told him this is the same thing I had ordered a few weeks before with the same deal. He again said I owed him 12.00 more for a small cheese pizza. I explained I did not have the extra money and would not have ordered it. He said I did order it and owe him. I again said that I can not afford that for a small cheese pizza. He yanks the pizza from the stack and throws it into the back cooking area smashing into pots and pans making a crashing sound. The staff from the back run out to see what is happening. I stand amazed and say you didn't have to do that. He yells back at me ITS MY PIZZA I CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT. He is so worked up that he gives me to much change back which I return to him. No thanks just rage and anger. I was sad and when I contacted corporate in Chicago they explained that he is not part of their company. The name is the same the food  and menu is too. So he is on his own and does what he wants. So if you are up for a freak show feel free to come in and see the owner act out like a child in a temper tantrum.
1,"This is a great value if you really take advantage of all if the exhibits that they have to offer. I did read many reviews ahead of time and figured that it would be a small themed museum that you could spin through in 45 minutes to a hour- WRONG!! \nWhen we got there the friendly staff informed us that we should allow about 3 hours. \""Yeah, right\"", I thought, \""I'm not that into this stuff! How can there be that much to see?!\"" I was mistaken! \nThey have done a great job of presenting a wide variety of exhibits that address the different aspects of organized crime (the most notorious mobsters, women who were involved with the business, children who grew up around this lifestyle, the impact organized crime had on Vegas, etc). There are so many topics that they cover and they really offer some very interesting interactive exhibits that keep you more engaged than just a wall of information and pictures. \nI actually short changed myself at this museum because I planned poorly and went before lunchtime. After about 3 hours we were so hungry that we had to finish our tour so we wouldn't waste away for hunger. I wish that I had planned better so we could have stayed another hour or so to be able to finish up all the exhibits at the pace that we had been going. We found it very engaging and I was surprised to know how interested I ended up being in Mob history!"
1,"This bike shop is awesome! They go above and beyond to put together your dream bike, I could not be happier with the customer service they gave me and the wonderful atmosphere this shop brings! DEFINITELY recommend them :)"
0,"Food was really not that great.\n\nThe garlic shrimp appetizer, granted, it was good and ample, but the shrimp were overdone and tough.\n\nWe had two platos, I had a tamarind pork and my husband had shredded beef. \nTamarind Pork-It was a huge plate and portion, but the tamarind sauce was way sweet.  Usually, my notion of tamarind is savory.  The side vegetables were alright and the beans were decent.\nShredded beef-We both thought it had a funny flavor to it.  Once we literally got in to it, we realized it was green olive flavor, which we both don't like.  Other than that olive flavor, it was okay.\nMojito - good, but not great and it was quite small."
0,"Ok this is hard for me beause the food is 6 stars.  I take my friends, family, clients here and everybody raves about it ..... but.  The smart ass kids at the counter have got to go.  I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says \""Focaccia is Italian\"" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.\n\nSo I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has \""echemica that is a bad for your brain\"". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)\n\nSo Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.\n\nHate having to write this one."
1,"I went here one time for the Bud Light Pool Party in 2011 and I may have really enjoyed my stay because of the all inclusive drinks, food, and stay.  But I had a fabulous time, the staff were awesome and the pools are great.  I think if I didn't have to leave I could have spent my whole vacation at the restaurant with concert venue, restaurants, pools, casino, Vanity night club, and bars.  \n\nThe rooms are gorgeous with the lay out, decor, and bathroom set up.  Our room was on the pool side so waking up to music blasting at the pool can be an annoyance for people who are sensitive to noise early in the morning/afternoon.  \nThere is also a Starbucks for guests who need their morning caffeine fix.  \n\nBe careful not to touch anything in the mini bar even to pick up and examine because they are sensitive and will charge automatically.  I only noticed when I was playing with the tv and saw I could view our statement and noticed that we were charged when my friend one drunken night decided to pull everything out of the fridge to put her Mr. Lucky's left overs.  REMINDER: DON'T LET FRIENDS GET DRUNK AND PULL EVERYTHING OUT OF THE MINI BAR TO STORE HER LEFT OVERS!!!\n\nThis hotel is not on the strip but a cab drive way, the hotel is great to stay at but if you want to be in walking distance of the strip stay somewhere else."
0,"This was the worse experience that I've ever had at a physical therapy clinic. The facility was a ZOO, everyone was running around & very disorganized. I had 4 sessions of physical therapy at this facility & was treated most of the time by the Technicians. The Technicians were nice, but when I go to physical therapy, I expect to be treated by physical therapist. I've had many sessions of physical therapy in the past due to various injuries throughout my life & would not recommend Matt Smith to anyone. I also spoke to several patients at the facility & not one of them was happy with the services that they were getting."
1,"decided to come here because my friend and i received a coupon for a free margarita with the purchase of an entree. we were roaming around to kill some time before watching the lion king and needed a place to eat dinner anyway. we were seated right away. our server was really nice. the food is a bit pricey compared to other mexican places but it was good. i ordered the combo tacos which came with one chicken, carne, and carnitas taco. all of which were very tasty. my friend got the chicken burrito...also good. the margaritas were good and strong considering that they were free. i'd come back if i ever venture back to the luxor."
0,"I got one piece of pumpkin bread and a plain iced coffee... $7.11! \n\n7/11 is where I should've went. I could get a jackolantern to deliver pumpkin bread, and blow out my candle, for that price. This place is going in Lil Bootsy's litterbox."
0,"One word to describe this place- awful. Sure not as bad as Philly, but Charlotte at least gets second place! Trying to get across this airport is like a huge race! I've never seen so many people running around like madmen to get on connecting flights. When I was in the same situation, I ran like crazy with my wife and child to get from gate to gate. Finally when we got there, the woman who's name was I believe faseeka? Phasequa? Ghetto girl? Told us she had held the flight as long as possible; which was only about 5 minutes. The plane is still sitting near the gate clearly visible from the window. We pleaded with faseequa to let us on, but she literally too us the flight was closed and turned around so she wouldn't have to look at us. When we came back about 10/15 minutes later, the plane was STILL THERE! She then continued to type nonsense on her computer while I tried to talk to her. I asked her name, and then how I should spell it. She then refused to spell her name and got really snippy and utterly ignored me. In the end we missed a flight that was right there, sitting with the DOOR OPEN for 15 minute because faseequa refused to let us on. Screw this airport! We then had to wait 5 hours for another flight to an airport 2 hours from our house. Thanks you cold heartless woman. I understand your job is veeeerryyyy stressful, sorry to trouble you like that faseequa! (Sarcasm)"
1,"As I've said before, I typically  don't  bother writing a review when there is already a voluminous set of other reviews stating everything I'd want to, and more concisely than I could... but Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in the valley, so I'm still going to add my two cents.\n\nI've never had a bad meal at Sakana. Even when busy, which seems to be more often than not as of late, the service is good, the prices are decent and the portions huge.\n\nRecently, they started having a Monday night happy hour-ish menu offering discounted maki rolls that include lettuce in the place of avocado. I've also seen promotions offering appetizers for 0.50 when you buy a Kirin or Kirin Light. Oh yeah, last but not least, you get orange slices with your bill... which is a nice touch."
1,"Yelp, your mobile app has taken me home again!\n\nIt's nice to have a spot that has not significantly changed in the 20+ years that I have been a patron...even tho nearly 20 years has passed between my last visit and my most recent.\n\nCasey Moore's Oyster House patio was the spot one of my instructors selected for the lecture portion of his class.  Every Tuesday, from 2-3:30 PM, we sat at a table and discussed designing costumes/lights/sets/sound for ASU theatre productions.  Between the munchies and the black and tans, our discussions became quite animated and we certainly considered more creative design concepts.  It was quite cool to be able to have class and a beer (or 3) at the same time.\n\nFast-forward from 1989 (my first experience at Casey Moore's) to 2011 (my return to Tempe for work).\n\nThe food is still outstanding, the location is easily accessable, the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  The prices, unfortunately, are a bit higher than other places."
0,"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this complex. My family of 4 moved here almost a year ago, and I am counting down the days until my lease is up. There are countless issues since we have lived here.\n\n1. Maintenance requests will take a while to fill. (Be warned) I had put in a request that my dishwasher was leaving a nasty residue, and I receive a call almost 2 weeks later asking me if I had run vinegar through the wash. (YES...I had, but thanks for asking 2 weeks later!) I had also put in a maintenance request because the knob would fall off of my dryer often. It fell off a total of 3 times, each time necessitating an order for repair. When they finally replaced the dryer, it was much older and now does not turn off on its own. \n\n2. The water has been shut off 3 or more times. (often without warning) And, it's been off as long as an entire work day. Not to mention, I can never take a bath because the hot water runs cold in about 5 minutes. \n\n3. My parking spot is a good walk from my actual unit. When Brent was working here, he assigned me a new spot right in front of my apartment around 8 months into my lease. I was very grateful, come to find out management has reassigned my spot to the apartment next door. Brent told me this would be my new permanent spot, and not a temporary solution. Brent doesn't work here anymore, so I guess they don't feel the need to stand behind the word of a previous employee.\n\n4. Several of the staff are rude and unprofessional. I had to go have my gate card reprogrammed, and the office worker treated me like a nuisance. A different time, my husband went into the office to grab a package. The worker asked him to wait 10 minutes, because it had been crazy busy. Are you serious? To pick up a package? Get your act together! Hire more staff if you're that overwhelmed. Not to mention, almost every time I step foot in the office, there is a disgruntled renter complaining and asking to speak to the manager.\n\n5. I live on the second floor, and I hear every foot step up and down the stairs. I have a sleeping baby, and the noise level from the stairs has been difficult to deal with. \n\n6. My neighbors (downstairs and next door) both moved out around the same time. The units were renovated, and they woke up my sleeping baby almost every day for a couple weeks. So, be prepared for renovation above, below, and next door:)\n\n7. I went to change my air filter about a month ago (on my own, because I wasn't going to wait a week for it to be changed), and it looked as if it hadn't been changed in about 3 years. (we have lived here about 10 months) I've never seen such a gross air filter:/ \n\n8. They are raising their prices significantly, and the customer service has gone way down. My extended family used to live here when it was Acacia Creek (under different management)...and had a good experience. My fellow renters have told me they are having similar issues.  \n\nI hope you have found this review helpful. It is very honest, but I would have appreciated having this information prior to move in."
0,Ok so I have NEVER left a yelp review before in my life! We tried to have dinner at Andreas and were willing to sit in the cocktail lounge because we did not make reservation. The hostess told us it was first come first served so we grabbed a table only to be told that since we were (the guys) wearing shorts that we couldn't dine there. I'm sorry but I work at one of the highest grossing restaurants in the country (in NYC) and people can walk into there wearing whatever they want! We are in fucking Las Vegas get over yourselves honestly!!!!
1,Had Happy Hour on Monday at the Borgata location.\nLoved the appetizers.The ceviche is outstanding. \nHad the Quesadilla with Chicken (very good) and the tacos with pork. Delish!\nI had the berry margarita. Loved it. My husband has a beer.Beer was OK. There are better brews in Phoenix. \nService was very good.\nWill be back!
0,You could not stop me from 1 staring this company. I have said before a bad company can't hide. Worst customer service ever (agreed). Chronic problems with web mail unresolved after years! If you don't like the cable service then get free cable with an antenna. They had a monopoly almost until Century Link came along but again you can get FREE HD cable (40+ channels) with an antenna. Vote with your feet (by walking away).
1,"I got a call today from the girls at Destiny's Bride telling me that my dress arrived... yay!  \n\nAfter searching high and low for \""the one,\"" I found it at Destiny's Bride back in February... Like Kate C, I worked with Linda - she was fabulous!  I felt comfortable immediately...  I tried on a bunch of dresses but ultimately went with the first one I saw at the store.  As I walked upstairs and the woman helping me at the time asked me what I was looking for, I looked up and said \""something like... that!\"" (and pointed at my dress that was hanging on the mannequin).\n\nLinda helped me with envisioning accessories, etc... but I'm waiting until I see it again to make those decisions.  When we put the order in, I was told the dress would arrive in September... but it's early August and it's here - no stress - gotta love that!\n\nMy mom also found the dress she'll wear at the wedding at Destiny's Bride.  If you are shopping for that perfect dress for your wedding, I highly recommend Destiny's!  I'll update this again after my alterations are done, accessories found, etc... but so far, no complaints!"
1,Cupcakessssss are to Die for.
1,I've eaten at Sushi Samba before in NY and I'm a fan therefore I did not hesitate to eat here again for lunch when I was in Vegas.  The food did not disappoint.  Sushi rolls were fresh and yummy.  We had the kobe and lobster.  My choice of cocktail raspberry watermelon was refreshing.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Pricey but definitely worth it.
0,"This place is near my job. It is one of the few restaurants that I can eat at in the area, between my refusal to eat animal products and a gluten intolerance. I have eaten here over a dozen times. I agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced, but I have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up. \n\nHOWEVER, twice a single staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up. The first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to realize it. She gave me a strange look when I asked for another napkin. Once she realized it she did apologize. The second time she spilled someone else's ice on my feet and purse. I got a muttered apology with no eye contact. I waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business. I am a  regular and it was the second spill. No one approached me so I left. \n\nI do believe that the young woman is a nice person. She seemed embarrassed, but the staff have poor customer service skills.\n\nAlso, I believe that they substitute greens without informing the customer. Once I ordered romaine and believe I got iceberg. Same thing when I ordered butter lettuce. If you want real greens ask for spinach or the mixed greens.\n\nI admire the effort to open a healthy restaurant in South Phoenix. I wish this place was managed better..."
0,"Hadn't been back here in sometime. Was very disappointed at the slow service and mediocre food quality. Sure not like it used to be. Even the manager negotiated what she'd bring in response to a simple request for sour cream. Too bad. Used to be a favorite with good food, drinks, service, and ambiance. Seems even the ducks have moved on."
1,"It is all Nora V.'s fault that I had to come order from this place!  =)  So after shopping at Target, I had to come get my Asian on!  LOL!\n\nI walked in and placed an order to go:\n1.  BBQ Pork - This is from the apps selection:  the bbq sauce to too sweet for my liking\n2.  Sesame Chicken - I liked their version, but the chicken could be crispier but then again I got it togo so it was steaming in the container\n3.  Beef Chow Fun - This is a good flavorful dish but the chow fun was made with thin flat noodles not the normal flat wide noodles.  Either way, it is was good."
1,"One of the best pizza's I've had to date.  We ordered a pizza from Metro after landing in our room at the MGM nearing the end of a 25hr. day.  We ordered the deep dish pepperoni pie and garlic knots.  It was so filling and I struggled to eat more than one slice.  The Garlic Knots were the best knots that I've ever had.  They were like a meal all in it's own.\n  My only gripe is that the delivery driver wouldn't deliver it to our room.  After 25hrs of being awake due to a delayed flight and 3rd shift job, walking down to the valet to get our pizza was the last thing we wanted to do."
0,"So sad...such great food and this location is a mess. Took 20 minutes to order and get my food with ONE person in front of me. Lady working was unhappy to say the least, and I stood at the counter after my food was done for 3 minutes before somebody else came over to ring me up (she was busy talking to friend that came to see her). She short charged me...didn't ring up enchilada style nor the queso dip. Normally I would correct her but I wasn't about to waste my energy helping such a pathetic group of employees. There were TWO guys eating and the place was trashed. Dirty tables, napkins strewn all over the floor...\n\nI will never go back to this location. Stephanie St. location is 100x better in every way possible. \n\nBut hey, thanks for the free queso!"
0,The waiter was great but he just could not do it all MR IHOP \nYOU had one server working the entire floor and one bus guy/ cashier\n Ordered The chicken dinner mashed potatoes....oops sorry we're out of mashed potatoes!!!!   They brought me fries instead. \nWe asked form sugar free syrup....oops....OUT of sugar free syrup Mr IHOP\n\n My omelet was good .....\n\n\nJust want you to know how you are doing.
1,"Actually this review is for the buffet. Hidden jewel to us. We did the Rio buffet (pretty good), hit Harrahs that was good but Flamingo for lunch had no line and the food was on point. July 4th and no crowd? Nice"
1,"Since I've become a resident of the Dormont area, I fancy the idea of a pool named after it. The Dormont Pool is legit. Imitators beware.\n\nFirst off, the actual pool is huge. One can use the slide, (which isn't exclusively fun for children,) swim some laps, or dive off their platform of a diving board all in the same body of water. \n\nThe Dormont Pool has free wifi which is awesome, but for a $6 fee every time, it's kind of expected. Not gonna lie. \n\nI wish the diving board had some more bounce, even though I know the pool has to be deeper than like 12 feet, I'm just saying. Plus, the entrance fee is kind of ifffyy. I mean if you're not a babysitter, how much time do you really spend at a pool. I'm thinking like 2 hours max.\n\nMaybe that's just me."

0,"the luxor's sorta-kinda-cool-from-the-outside pyramid shape wreaks havoc on the hotel rooms within.  low ceilings, angled windows that you have to lean back at a precarious angle to see out of (and that, even with the dark tint, require the curtains to be drawn at all times to keep the room from heating up to uncomfortable degrees), and ... malfunctioning plumbing.  we thought it was just our room that was cursed with a non-flushing toilet.  but friends who have stayed at the luxor in the past were quick to mention experiencing the same issue.  all i can come up with is that this is a HUGE design flaw in the pyramidal structure: none of the rooms are directly above one another, so it would seem that none of the pipes would be directly lined up in a vertical fashion, resulting in poor water flow?  clearly i am not a physicist or engineer, but that's the only thing i can think of to explain the issue, since the bathrooms on the main floor of the casino seemed to function properly.  \n\namenities in the hotel were mixed: no good food options (a mini-food court with some nasty fast food, about six starbucks, and a buffet), an ok spa, and an ok pool.  they have systematically removed anything that might cast a shadow from the pool area to make the non-fee area as uncomfortable as possible and encourage use of the $30 \""private\"" area with umbrellas, cabanas, and shade to spare.  best $30 i spent in vegas.  seriously.  \n\nthe location is ok, as it's connected to mandalay, but you're not extremely close to the rest of the casinos and will end up taking cabs a fair amount."
0,Not impressed. The food was not very flavor full and the service was slow and non existent. We couldn't get out waitresses attention so my husband went to order a drink at the bar. There were 4 people behind the bar washing dishes and even looked up at him and didn't see of he needed assistance. This is not what I am used to from a Mexican restaurant. You don't get what you pay for.
0,"I've avoided Wal-Marts in big cities for years. Life is too short. But WM seems to be trying to upgrade its image, its stores, and the quality of the fresh foods in their Supercenters. So I gave this one a try. I got three or four items from the produce center (it was actually quite impressive), and headed to the 12 items or less lane. There were maybe a dozen people in that line in front of me. Sigh. Oh well.\n\nSo I stand there - checking my iPhone email - and it slowly dawns on me that someone is yelling. So I look up and I see the cashier of this line - a grizzled old lady shaking her bony finger - is screaming for me to get out of her line because she'd turned her light off. No joke - screaming! It took me a good five or six seconds to truly realize that this was actually happening, and happening to me. So I yelled back that someone as old as her should have better manners, that her light was on when I got in line, and that she should feel free to proceed straight to hell. I dropped my produce on the floor and walked straight out the door. Never again..."
1,"This is one of our favorite chain restaurants to have dinner. Our server, Odie, always makes the evening enjoyable. The kids love the bread and their scaloppine is great."
0,"After a great time at Copper Blues I wound up here. Pretty lackluster experience and this is sad because I had high hopes for this place. There was nothing blatantly bad about my experience but the vibe, the clientele, everything about just kind of sucked. There was nothing about the vibe or atmosphere that made me want to stay...in fact I left after one beer. \nThe place just opened up, so it's quite possible that everyone is stil getting their bearings so I'll probably pop in one more time in a few months to see if the vibe is the same. \n\nThe bar is indoor/outdoor and opens onto a a concrete patio that is definitely the best feature at this location. The patio has awesom eastern views of downtown and it's really cool in the late afternoon early evenings. Unfortunately they HAVE to do something about the patio high chairs because they are uncomfortable as hell."

0,"Okay, I was a fool for neglecting the poor reviews on yelp before booking the luxor. It was a true disappointment in service.\n\nLocation: **I've stayed at the bellagio and bally's in my past stays in vegas. They were prime locations, right smack dead in the center of the strip. The Luxor is on the wayside of the strip. Don't want a costly hotel bill? Well think again because your taxi expense will shoot straight up faster than you can say, damn shit luxor you screwed me over. mhm. \n\nService: \n\n**Checking in was a complete pain. The service agent was rude, impatient and a bit condescending. Well lady, screw you. ( i know i'm chicken shit, since i can't say it in front of her face... -__-)\n\n**Me and my friends requested extra towels and they remarkably arrived at 11pm, mind you we ordered them around 4pm. Luckily we were already trashed as shit and tired from the lack of sleep the night before.\n\n**Our room keys were somehow left inside our room, which was extremely frustrating esp. when it's @ 4am after a night of raging. The front desk was no help, they directed us to wait by the elevator for security, we waited 30 minutes and no one came. So we went back to the front desk, and some pleasant worker was able to provide us with new room keys. \n\nRoom: **we had a room in the pyramid and it was pretty cool. Typical hotel room. Clean and spacious. Although, these rooms are like an oven. With the exterior of the building being all black and slanted, the head permeates though the glass and is trapped in your room. If you're there in the summer, blast the AC, and close the curtins, or you'll bake.. -____-\n\nPool:** Nice a sunny, no buildings casting a shadow over my GTL time. Huge area with a lot of seating to accommodate their other foolish guests.\n\nAttractions:\n\nTitanic Exhibit and Bodies Exhibit were stationed here during my visit. It def. an unforgettable experience, and a must see to everyone who is in vegas. (plus 1star)\n\nIt was truly a bitter experience at the luxor, I don't ever want to stay on the wayside of the strip again. Esp. when service on this end sucks and frankly, nothing is really happening over here except for... well you and your guest. haha"
1,"While not a guest of the hotel, I had the chance to check out the public amenities at the hotel and Yay! I'm a fan...\n\n- The rooftop bar: the hipsterist of hipstery places in PHX. The view is pretty breathtaking and the music had a nice, lounge-y vibe. Its definitely a place to be seen - and see the white skinned hipsters avoid the sun and smoke cigarettes. The drinks were bad (the soda in my vodka was flat) and pricey, but still a great place to catch a drink.\n\n- The pool: apparently, despite the sign, anyone can come to the pool and take advantage of the somewhat sporadic poolside waitress. Again, pricey, but the drinks were good.  And nothing feels like vacation more than poolside bar service.\n\nIf you can afford it, the Clarendon will make you feel like you're hanging out with the cool kids in a hipster paradise.  Right down to the urinals shaped like mouths from the Rolling Stones logo."

1,"Well, we were looking for great budget lodging in Montreal and what we got was the time of our life.  \n\nI really and honestly believe that our trip to this great city wouldn't have been as awesome as it was with out our stay at Abri Du Voyageaur Hotel.  Every part of our stay, from check in to check out, was perfect.  The staff were friendly, accommodating, and extremely helpful with recommendations to area attractions and directions to cheaper parking arrangements. The location is perfect, close to just about everything.  Almost everywhere we went was only a short walk away, including restaurants, bars, and lots of shopping.  \n\nThe room was impeccable and much nicer than most budget accommodations in the States.  I've definitely paid more in the past to receive less  The room was comfy and clean.  Sure, the shower was small, but it reminded me of the showers in Europe which was fine by use.  I was delighted by the shared computer in the lobby since both of our phones were basically unusable with out WiFi (oh yeah, they have that too. For free!).  \n\nI am so happy that we stumbled upon this hotel because I wouldn't imagine staying anywhere else when in Montreal (unless I hit the lottery)."
1,"This is a great neighborhood joint!  I walked in a little before 11 and a group of women were in the corner, playing scrabble or some sort of game--clearly they were regulars.  The atmosphere is bare bones, but comfortable.  for lunch I had the tuna sandwich--this was a great sandwich--the proportion of tuna to apple was just right.  I will definitely be putting Bertha's on my rotation for a great place to go for a great sandwich."
0,"This place is over lated... My husband and I decided to try this place because the review is high and i always love to try a new spot(especially the japanese one)\nWhen we arrived,there were 3 groups(not including us)and a customer at the bar. Looked like 2 groups were already done, they were just talking.\n\nWe orderd Green salad,Kaeaage,Shrimp tempura roll,Hamachi-kama,Gyu-tan-sushi and Ikura-sushi.We also tried Samuel Smith's apple cider beer.It was really good!\nWhen we finish ordering, 2groups left the restaurant,so it was just us,the other and some at the bar.\n\nThe first thing I thought was 'How many people working in this restaurant?'\nI saw at lease 5people working around the floor.\nI understand it's because they want to care every customers I think.\nand I thought everybody who works at the restaurant was nice in the beginning.\n\nWe got a salad first,it was okay,nothing special,but I loved pear in it.\nSecond,Karaage was served.We liked little spicy tast.\nThen... we WAITED so long to get our entire meal!!!!!(over an hour!!!)\nand at this point,the server started to avoid us.\nWe of cause finished karaage(we are not fast eater.we eat dishse slowly especialy when we drink alcohol.) and we kinda sarted getting annoyed.I don't know why it took sooo long to make our dishes.When the restaurant is really busy,I totally understand,BUT this slow and I don't think the other group orderd a lot of food.\nWhen the manager came to our table,I asked her about our sushi,roll and kama,then she saied 'We want you to forcus our dishse one by one'\nREALLY???\nWe were too tired to forcus each dishes.\nFinally,we got sushi,roll and kama.(It didn't come at one time,we waited so long to get each dishes.)Our mood was already bad and we wanted to get out here,so It maybe is good tast,but we didn't feel any good ways especially the kama was not tast good.\nI think every server noticed that our mood is not good,so nobody came to our table so it was hard to get our check.then I put my card with my bill,nobody returned so I changed to pay by cash.\n\nYou got many servers,why nobody can care us???or\nNobody care us,why you got many servers???\nBAD SERVICE!!!!!We will never come back.\n\nWhy 2stars?\nBecause one server brought us a fruits dish.She didn't say because of the slow service,she just told us it is free.but it can't cover all our bad experience here."
1,"Great Margaritas!\n\nBe careful not to fill up on chips, salsa and bean dip before dinner.\n\nFor some reason, this place is always slammed.\nI definitely recommend going here early.\nService is great!  They have lots of servers and people refilling waters and removing plates, etc... \nWent on a Friday night and there was a full on mariachi band playing.\nSo, if you are looking for a quiet meal... it's not going to be here.\nThis place is fun and loud.\nTheir menu offers LOTS of options.... Chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc...\nI always have a hard time deciding what I want.\nAnd I usually take home half of what I order because their portions are large and after the chips, salsa and bean dip, I'm mostly full when dinner arrives.\nAll entrees are served with rice and beans.\nAnd if you get something that comes with flour or corn tortillas... oh man... hard to choose.  Their corn tortillas are not the usual dry corn tortillas.  Their corn tortillas are AWESOME.  But then so are their flour tortillas.  But because I don't get to enjoy corn tortillas like theirs... I usually get the corn.  I highly recommend the corn tortillas... Get Them and Taste the difference.  All corn tortillas should be like this.  :)"
0,"I have been going here for a while now. About 2 weeks after my last manicure (when the polish came off) I started to notice on my middle finger changes in my nail bed (discoloration) after 3 weeks the nail started lifting from the side and was getting thick, yellow & crusty on that same side of the nail. I was really concerned and went to a dermatologist and YES they did confirm that it was Nail Fungus!! This was the ONLY place I have been to in the last ten months and I have no doubts this is where I got it from. I'm very upset because fungus is not something that can just go away on its own and it is never a sure bet that it will ever go away with treatment, plus it is very unsightly!  Please make sure wherever you go all the equipment is sterilized properly and that the bowls and sinks that your feet and hands are in are cleaned very well. I don't believe that they properly sanitize anything because if you watch they will just rinse out the tubs and stick the next customer right in and then get their nail equipment out of a plastic container. No sterilizing between customers. Ugh, I'm upset.  Be aware of this place ladies!!"
0,"Unfortunately not a great place for service! We went with a group of friends and chose this place because of the Phoenix magazine review...disappointed to say the least. The food was pretty good. I had a chicken burrito and the guacamole was amazing! But the owner was extremely rude! They wouldn't seat or even take a soda order for my friends before we got there. When there was two tables open on the patio the the waiter asked us to choose one, when I sat down the \""owner\"" walked by and asked if I would like to sit at a dirty table (well...not really) in an extremely rude demeaning tone. That was the FIRST of many unfortunate happening at this restaurant specifically with the lady owner.  Our waiter, a younger guy that said she was family was actually very nice and apologetic that she was not a happy person...obviously we could tell that by the way we were treated. Will not make the drive back..."
1,"Great, friendly staff that are very knowledgable. Did a great job on a memory upgrade. Did the work in minutes while I waited. Wonderful experience, my new go to place."
1,"Two years is a long time... \n\nI had the FTR for this restaurant over two years ago.  It was the worst review I've ever written for any business.  If you'd asked me two years ago to return to The Estate House, there was no way I'd say yes.\n\nBut in two years, this place has really come a long way... I believe the three star bump I'm giving to my original review is thanks to Zoran, the GM, Chef Gio Osso, and a crew of friendly and attentive staff.  \n\nThe Estate House is still as beautiful as I remember it being in February 2008, but it's perhaps even more beautiful now that they've got the ambiance, cuisine, and service to go with the physical beauty.\n\nMy evening kicked off with a little mixer on the outdoor third floor patio.  Service was fantastic and drinks were strong.  I corresponded with guests at the mixer, but also with many of the Estate House staff.  From there, I went downstairs for a lovely dinner with my husband.  While the menu is still on the fancy side for me, I was pleased with everything from the appetizers to the dessert.  \n\nWe ordered the Burrata and Scallop appetizers, and were served way too much fresh bread to start as well... Turns out they were out of Burrata but replaced it with the smoothest, creamiest, largest pillow of Mozzarella I've ever had.  We cleaned both plates.  Jared went with the Moroccan Seven Spice Grilled Lamb entree and I chose the Honey Saba Lacquered Black Cod.  Both were unique preparations with a ton of flavor.  I could've done without the candied pancetta on the cod, but that didn't stop me from eating way too much.  In addition, we had grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach... (the greens balance out everything else, right?!)\n\nWe were stuffed but were joined by a couple of friends for dessert and shared the bread pudding and a chocolate peanut butter special... both were fabulous.  All of this while enjoying a bottle of wine.\n\nNeedless to say, I am extremely happy I gave The Estate House another shot.  They've come a long way in two years, and I anticipate returning again soon.  I encourage you to do the same.\n\n**They are now open for lunch (which I must say looks very reasonable), and they have all kinds of special events including Cooking Classes, Easter Brunch, Simple Sunday Dinners, etc..."
0,"Bad. I'm sorry, but it's just bad. The prices they charge for this lackluster food and inept service are completely laughable.\n\nIt's not even that it's so inedible, it's just that there are much better places in Pittsburgh to eat Thai food and although this is the only Thai restaurant in the general Dormont area, if you're willing to be a little flexible then there is much better Asian food to be had around there. I can't really think of any good reason to come here."
0,Poor service and all 7 of our steaks were literally cold when the finally came out. Will never go back. Ruth Cris is 10x better.
0,"This will be short and sweet...which i usually don't do. AJ's fine foods...has fine food and great presentation...but the prices are absolutely not worth it for the exact same products at other stores. I guess there is only one kind of customer that would shop here...and that is a foolish one...again especially for the same exact products. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends...just don't do it at AJ's fine foods."
1,"Solid dealers, spacious room, high tech features out the ass, and a floor staff and management that actually give a shit. You would think it would just be about the dealing but you would be wrong. This place feels like a home away from home when I want to play some poker and have a good time. Oh, and they will basically spread any game you want. Can't beat it!"
1,"Met friends on a Sunday evening. I was very surprised at the menu, like other reviewers, I expected just another tavern. BF had the T-bone, huge portion and he loved it! I had to leave after an appetizer, due to scheduling, but the party of 6 stayed for hours! Only thing missing, only one Cider option. Attention management: Apple ciders are all the rage, and a good option for ladies that don't care for beer. You get the gents in with all your beers, but keep us girls happy too!"
1,"Solid brunch. The seven of us trickled in slowly but surely after a long previous evening and made our first orders. Some went with Guinness, I tried to order a Bloody but they were having to search for a key ingredient so I opted for a Breckenridge Vanilla Porter instead (get one when you see it, they're deeeelish).\n\nFood menu for brunch is limited, but what we had we all loved. I went with the chicken hash which is really more like an open-faced pot pie or a Shepherd's pie without the mashed potatoes, and is served on croissant halves. It was about as decadent as it sounds, yes. My friend's blackberry French toast was ridiculous (more tart than sweet) and the guys that ordered the salmon omelette were all very pleased, especially with the cumin on the potatoes. Good call, Brillobox.\n\nI hear it's loaded with hipsters as night falls, but this particular Sunday it was wide open and sparsely populated. The bartender was also the server and was just busy enough to cause delays and empty glasses, but it was nothing we couldn't get over with another round of drinks."
1,"This place has character, that's for sure.  How do you rate a place that wasn't necessarily built for concerts, more like choirs, let's say.  Originally a church it's seriously super cool to be inside listening to a rock band.  I don't think they did much to change the place other than add equipment for the shows.  I'd assume you'd have some nice built in acoustics for singing, not sure about rocking though...\n\nIt's not going to be your fancy pants Stage AE custom built for concerts, but gosh darnit does it have some history and bring some awesome bands to the Burgh!  Seriously, they bring in some great acts.  If I'm scanning the city paper for ads I usually pick out at least one or two shows a month I'd go and see.\n\nBeing an old head I enjoy that the over 21 bar area is split up from the youngins.  I had my mosh pit days.  Now I just want to stand with my beer and watch a nice quite, er, loud rock show.  No shoving for me!  My Yuengling was $4, not bad and NOT fancy pants arena prices, thankyouverymuch!  \n\nI wish the parking situation is better.  It's in a random part of town that has no real parking lot area, so you have to kind of fend for yourself on the street.  So come early if you want to rock early!  I obviously want to use the word rock as much as I can in this review... so if you want a place to rock out, this is your place... to rock!"
0,"First visit food was good,  but service was erratic.  Came back for a second visit Tuesday at noon.   The doors were locked and no one in sight.   Their hours mon-thurs on the front door state they open at 11:30.  Very odd..."
1,"I LOVE the crab claws...delicous goodness.  I would recommend getting the large claws instead of the medium...so much more meat.  I went for lunch and got the 3 large claws with hash brown, salad & dessert.  The hash brown was ginomous...don't see how anyone can finish that by themselves.  I had a piece of their filet mignon and it was very good.  Can't wait to go back =)"
1,"A colleague of mine who used to work in Phoenix recommended a visit to the Heard Museum and, wanting to indulge in a little bit of culture that wasn't an art museum per se, I knew I had to stop by.\n\nI've never been to a museum solely dedicated to Native American history; I've only seen small collections in art museums.  The Heard's collection is amazing:  everything from a thousand year old pottery to Navajo rugs to an exhibit introducing the visitor to each of Arizona's many tribes.  Many are interactive and include activities for kids.  I can see this being a great place to take children to.\n\nBeautiful building and wonderful collection.  I hope the Heard continues to do well and educate the public on Native American history.\n\nQuick side note:  Excellent little cafe, stop in for a bit to eat after exploring the museum.  Don't forget to pop your head into the gift shops, either.  Beautiful pieces, but really expensive!"
1,"Since I travel almost exclusively with US Airways, CLT (their main hub) is a frequent stop and I've been flying in/out of there for roughly 4 years now.\n\nPlanes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport I'm flying out of.  I've gone both domestic and international without a hassle.  If you have status with US Airways the fast track on the security line is a god send.\n\nThe restaurants are good with some lively bars.  The airport itself has a very open feel to it, littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell.  Shopping's decent if you're into that sort of thing.  It could do with more electrical outlets for the business travelers, but otherwise it's a solid place."
1,Great service and friendly staff! We ordered the short ribs and spicy pork. They were both flavorful and tender. We also go 6 side dishes to go with our lunch!
1,"Owned and run by Edinburgh Leisure, this 9 hole golf course is great for beginners and thouse who just don't want a long game. It's great to play, not too challenging and is not a good walk spoiled."
1,"I've been to this spot twice. The first time was in March, when I came for a timeshare presentation and ended up purchasing. The second was this weekend, for a bounceback presentation, to learn more about how to get the most of my points. For those who come out here and just want a cheap get-away, who know you will have to listen to a timeshare presentation, and who know certainly before even going in that you aren't going to leave with a timeshare, of course the presenters are going to irritate you and you have a high chance of not enjoying your stay.\n\nIf you don't like spending hours listening to their offers, then don't accept coming here in the first place. Yes, the place is off of the strip. Plenty of places are not on the strip. Chances are, if you haven't heard the name before, it may not be on the strip. Before you accept a weekend get-away, do your research - ask the right questions. \""So is your resort on the strip? No? How far is it?\"" \n\nI had signed up for a sample timeshare package with Worldmark by Wyndham, so timeshares had already been something I had experience with and was looking into. When I first came here, I had an open mind. I wanted to see what they could show me that's better than what Wyndham wanted to sell me. \n\nI travel a lot, I'm engaged, I plan to have children. A timeshare for my significant other and I work. It may or may not for you. \n\nThis past year I've spent a lot of time living in \""hotels\"". I don't think I can even accurately consider them as hotels. These places have a kitchenette, just like BlueGreen. For my lifestyle, where I like to cook breakfast for my fianc\u00e9e and store coconut water in a fridge, typical hotels on the strip just don't cut it. \n\nSo before you bash where you stay, think about your reasons for staying here. You were offered a free/cheap room so you hopped on the offer and now regret it. But if you aren't someone who needs to be by the clubs or casinos, and instead have a family, then this is perfect. \n\nWe've stayed both times in the Standard rooms. You get a bedroom that has a closet, dresser, and a tv. You get a spacious bathroom, there's a safe under the sink. You get a closet in the hallway, that also has an ironing board. The living room includes a big couch, coffee table, radio, and another tv. The kitchen has a dishwasher, oven, toaster, coffeemaker and all the utensils, plates and pots and pans you need. There's also a washer and dryer in the unit. They are not the greatest, but they are replacing them soon with GE units. Since I drive to Vegas, I just bring my laundry with me and do it while I'm here, so I can go back home and be ready for the upcoming week. \nI'm not sure why people complain about the lack of parking spaces. Do you mean that just because the first and closest 2-3 rows are filled up you don't want to park in the 4th, 5th row, that has plenty of space and walk? Because that's just being lazy, not having a lack of spots. \n\nThere's also a gym here. Weights go up to 50lbs. They have ellipticals, treadmills, bikes and a couple of machines to work legs and arms. It's not a full gym, but no one is ever working out here. If you're the hard core muscle head who needs a flat bench, incline and decline press, don't expect that here. Plus, you're only visitor in a million who is actually going to use the gym, so it's not worth having all that equipment for one person. The gym provides towels and has 3-4 tvs. I was able to get a great leg workout and get my sweat on. Make it work for you. \n\nI'm happy here and I love the feeling of being at a home away from home. Again, I don't need the clubs or the casinos so this place works for me."
0,"The Kitchener Delta is a classic case of bait n' switch. Their web site shows you pictures of their updated lobby, their bar area and their neon-blue swimming pool housed under a brightly lit atrium. All of this is true, but once you get past the lobby your experience goes steadily downward. \n\nWhile the bathroom of my room had been remodeled and was clean, the room hadn't been updated in ages. To be fair, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, but the finishings like the furniture and the carpets were well worn. The lamp shades are faded yellow and the televisions are older, small tube units.\n\nAlso, my room on the second floor was very, very loud. You can hear the traffic below through the double-paned windows. \n\nThe restaurant in the hotel is pretty run down. Even though their \""buffet\"" breakfast is free, it's well worth paying for something nicer on your own at a local restaurant. \n\nDon't be fooled by their \""fitness center\"" either. It's a bunch of run down equipment in a basement that smells pretty funky/musty. \n\nThe price was reasonable, but you really do get what you pay for. If you can afford $25-$50 more a night, I'm sure there are better places to stay. I hear the Radisson in Kitchener isn't so bad. Maybe that'll be my next stay/review."
0,"i know. i know. there's over 340 reviews, wut else is there to say? nuthin really. i just want to put in my 2 cents that i didn't like the show and was disappointed too }:(. pretty much for the same reasons others were disappointed, like how i wasn't awed by their physical performances. i do martial arts and so i expected more power and ferocity. i wanted ong bak 3! once upon a time in china part 10! but  they were kinda gay, dancy dancy. dude, the guys even had to paint on their own abs!!! wut tha fuck?"
1,"My first visit here, and it did not disappoint. Food was good and had fair portions. Staff was friendly and informed us about Happy Hour specials- $3 cheese crisps (amazing!) and $4 Matta's Margaritas. \n\nInterior is beautiful and clean. Displayed at the front door is their March 2014 county health inspection grade: A. Dining area is spacious and inviting. Cantina is a fun area with sports on the TVs. \n\nMy party ordered a diverse selection off the menu, and each item was great! Will definitely be coming back. \n\nSince Top Shelf on Southern closed, this is the next best thing- maybe better."
0,"Giving this place one star is way too generous.\n\nHere are my grievances about this pathetic place:\n\n1.  Myself and others were blatantly lied to that there would be no construction.  Two weeks in, it starts every night, all night at midnight and goes until around 5pm.  Be prepared for constant loud hammering and drilling on a nightly basis.  Want a good night's sleep before an exam?  Better off crashing with a friend, or on the sidewalk for that matter.\n\n2.  The elevators.  The waits often take 10-15 minutes, and they randomly stop working at the worst possible times.  One Saturday night, the night of a football game, ALL FOUR elevators stopped working.  Have fun walking up to the 19th floor along with the rest of the residents.\n\n3.  Maintenance requests are constantly ignored.  On move in day, I requested to have the lock on my bathroom door fixed.  It is now November and nothing has been done.  Similarly, a month ago they decided to lock all of our windows so that we could barely open them.\n\nEveryone I know who lives here, absolutely hates it.  Just today I passed up a manager talking to two girls hoping to move in, and was highly tempted to alert them that this place is run by lazy, dishonest scammers.  I'm sort of wishing I did so."
1,"Slowly becoming a big fan of this place.\n\nI am already a fan of Pomo Pizzaria, just up the street for La Piazza Locale.\n\nYes, this is the smae style of Pizza as Pomo, Cibo, Federal and la bianca (though not as gourmet as the last two),\n\nGood solid Napoli pizza (thin quick cooked, a bit soupy at times).\n\nThere are special pizzas every week, ask your waitress or waiter.\n\nGreat crust, pizza made to order.  \n\nThe woom is a bit dark and simple, but good pizza."
1,Came here to get a flow master exhaust put on my husbands new truck. Service was fast! In and out less than 45 min. Total $210. The guys there were nice. Family owned business.
0,"After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."
0,"I have to agree with Carly G.   As if the food isn't bad enough, the service is even worse.  I had to meet a few friends here so I decided to stay but regretted it.  We all did.  Pizza is awful, spaghetti is right out of a can, or it tasted like it.   Skip this one.  There are great Italian restaurants with far better food and service."
0,"Went to Aloha nails to get my gel manicure removed and a regular manicure after. One tech started, then another took over. She removed the gel (I thought, anyways), then did probably the worst manicure I've ever had. Maybe they prefer to do gel & acrylic nails and don't care to spend time on a regular nail manicure. After she removed the gel, she did a precursory filing, they were uneven and not even shaped. I asked her to file and she did an ok job then. However, no cuticle oil after the removal of the gel. She did not put a base coat, just 2 quick coats of the watered down nail polish. No top coat either. AND to top it off, when I just removed the nail polish today, a week later.....I found that there is STILL gel polish on my nails in spots. Would not recommend at all"
1,"Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Madison.\n\nI had lost all hope when I visited multiple \""Mexican\"" restaurants and they put velveeta cheese on everything.  Then I ate at Taqueria Guadalajara and I am so happy that I did!  The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and I am happy to report that they use non-synthetic cheese. Score!\n\nI usually get the Burrito Mexicano or chicken tacos, but anything on the menu is sure to satisfy you and won't break your budget.  \n\nI feel like I need to get a burrito right now after writing this review! Luckily they do take-out.  :)"
1,"Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long."
1,"Ah, the old Paramount Theater. Good memories over the years. \nI don't like watching movies in the suburbs as there is nothing to do once it's done but get in your car and go home. Here you can discuss the movie while walking around downtown\n\nThey normally get the first-rate movies and the leftovers go to the Pepsi Forum.\nThe prices are higher than Guzzo,but this is Downtown and they have renovated the seats, which are awesome. The screens are much larger than Guzzo and the Imax is awesome.\n\nThere's a small arcade, lounge area and eat-in tables. \nThe popcorn and candy is outrageously priced, but the burgers, chicken strips and nachos are kind of reasonable and made on the spot. There's a Tim Horton's on the premises that's priced the same as all others, so that's a bonus.\n\nThere are all sorts of discounts (Scene card, Cereal Boxes, Gas Station 2 for 1, ticket for $8 from Burger King with any trio purchased),so if anybody is paying full price on a non Tuesday and complaining, it's their own fault.\n\nI wish they would play more of their classic series, it seem to be intermittent and not as varied as before.\n\nAs for location, this is the Heart of Downtown for me, close to everything.\nBefore cell phones, this is the corner we would meet before a night out, it's linked to the underground city as well. \n\n."

0,"If no stars were possible, I would rate this  a 0!  I was given a different room then I booked.   Upon entering the room it smelled stale, the walls were filthy, and the bathroom not cleaned well.   As for the bed, the upholstery was ripping, the comforter was lumpy, and the box spring mattress caved in the middle. \n\nI've stayed at some questionable motels during road trips across country and this hotel by far took the cake.   The same room service cart from the room next to mine stayed there for 3 days.    I saw a maid walk by it 2 days out and put her Popsicle stick on it continuing to walk  passed it.    \n\nNow, let's talk about the eateries.   The breakfast cafe HORRIBLE! After being seated it took someone 20 mins to ask us if we wanted a drink, then 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order, and 45 minutes to get the less than appetizing food.   Vince Neil's Cantina.. You're better off going to Taco Bell.   \nI only chose this place due to the close proximity to the Mr Olympia Convention.  Lesson learned for next year. Save your money!"
0,The service was terrible. I would go back again because the food was good but would not go back just because of the service.
1,"I have a strict \""no spending money in Mesa\"" policy. (I avoid Mesa the same way I avoid nests of black widows, but that's a separate issue.) I admit that there are a FEW places in Mesa, and I mean a FEW, where I will spend my money. Red White and Brew is one of those few locations. \n\nMesa doesn't have many restaurants like this, especially not in north east Mesa. The floor plan is open, airy, well lit and feels roomy to me, even when the place is jam packed. I like the d\u00e9cor, it feels urban and modern. They bring to the table little buttery garlic bread things, which are good but filling. I have to have one and stop. I'm still impressed with their delicious barbeque chicken pizza and it's my default choice if I can't decide on anything else. I have tried a number of other dishes: pasta, steak, fish, salads and have enjoyed every one. The portion sizes are pretty damn enormous and I find it best to share with someone. The dessert menu is always a temptation as well. \n\nThey have a nice wine bar and I like their selection of draft beer. (In the winter, they sometimes carry Pumpkin Porter from Four Peaks. It's a seasonal favorite and if I wasn't so paranoid about calories, I'd drink it all the time.)\n\nI've never had an unpleasant experience with the staff. They have always been friendly, helpful, and professional. \n\nThe last time I checked, they don't take reservations, which makes going with a group a bit difficult. Depending on the time of day and the day of the week, the wait to get in can take a while. I hate waiting (especially to eat at a place in Mesa!) but Red White and Brew is usually worth it."
1,"I can understand why TOURISTS may not like this place but it really reminds of a local casino except it's old.  There's a small lounge, small gambling area and a cafe. It's small. It's not the Wynn or an 1/8 of it. But what makes this place cool *gasp* \nKaraoke.\nDollar shots.\nDollar beer.\nLocals. Drunk friendly locals. Drunk friendly locals that sing rockband karaoke and who work the behind the scenes.\n---- So remember you meanie tourists. The guy who thinks he can sing black hole sun next to you might be a guy who works in your swanky casino.---"
1,"I recently just signed a lease for a new rental house and was soooo excited to move in until I saw the condition of the tile and carpet in the house.  The carpets are trashed and need to be replaced and the grout in the tile was almost black from the built up dirt.  In a hurry to get things cleaned to move in, I called Bob with Horizon to help me out.  \n\nBob was able to come out the next day to help me with my speedy move-in.  I was afraid that the tile wasn't going to come clean and that I would have to replace all the grout.  I was scared to go to the house after the floors were cleaned because I was expecting the worst!  \n\nOnce I walked in the house I was shocked!! The floors looked brand new!!! Horizon does an AMAZING job and I couldn't be happier with the quick and quality service that I received when I was in a bind!! \n\nTHANK YOU HORIZON!!!\n\nKristin"
0,"I met a social group here last night for our monthly meet up. This was My 1st time @ Pizza-Re & was initially thrilled at the small space. Great for conversation.\nHOWEVER the pizza was mediocre. I love pizza & this was average tasting in My opinion. Fell along the lines of any pizza chain, pizza hut or domino's caliber.\nI was under the impression this was going to be some good gourmet pizza.\nThe prices were gourmet but the pizza was ehhhh, I can't believe I drove from Phoenix for this pizza.\nThey did have a low card option which was nice, but the only thing that was yummy was the cheese.\nThe pizza with crust seemed large in size and simply average in taste.\nThey do not sell alcohol but you can bring your own beer and wine, however they will charge you to open it!\nGreat environment for socializing, but I certainly was NOT impressed."
0,"Worst massage experience in the US.  In brief, I bought a Living Social deal for an 80 minute reflexology massage.  I checked the reviews and the website of the company first before buying and was expecting to have a massage from Mary.\n\nInstead, I received a massage from a guy who recently arrived from China.  My massage was not 80 minutes, it was about 65 minutes.  Unfortunately, I happened to open my eyes during the massage to find the man was picking his nose while massaging my feet.  He also burped loudly during the massage.  He used his nails when massaging my feet, and I have never had reflexology before so maybe it is normal, but I doubt it and it was very uncomfortable.\n\nOf course he asked me for a tip when he was done.  And to make it all worse, I told the girl at the front desk what happened, about the time, the nose picking, the burping, etc, and all she asked me was \""Is it okay?\"" and she told me that he was not going to be there much longer.  She did not offer any compensation even for the missing time.\n\nMy guess is they hired this guy just to massage the living social customers.  However, it is very bad for the company's reputation - I would not return- and when there is a problem I have very little respect for companies that do not set it right."
1,"A Friend of mine really wanted to come here for dinner so a group of us (guys and girls) decided what the heck.  This place is an awesome sports bar/restaurant as big flat screen TVs were everywhere.  The girls here were no Hawaiian Tropic models, but they weren't bad looking either.  One of them had stuck up attitude and that is a big minus in my book.\n\nNow to the food.  The prices were not too bad, but we didn't know what to expect. I had the Crackling Pork Shank.  It was effin HUGE! I don't care what others may have said, but it was good.  If your Asian, Filipino, Pacific Islander..whatever, you'll like this.  We ordered other dishes which were all good, but this one stood out for me."
0,"I wish I had known this was closed as well. We camped out near here and thought would be a great photo opportunity- Alas, the gates were closed, the signs were hung- and the fence was BARBED.  First time I had seriously considered trespassing- it looked like such a great spot for old timey photos, was tough to resist!"
1,"Been here 3 times, enjoyed it each time.\n\nThis time we had the prix fixe menu. So much food, could not finish it all.\n\nGreat food, great view, great service."
0,"Oh boy, I have had some pretty bad buffets in Las Vegas, but this one is without a doubt, the worst. That includes Sahara, Imperial Palace and Cirucs circus. This buffet's claim to fame is that \""every night is crab and prime rib night!\"" It's true, but they forgot to put that the crab meat is salty and cold and served without butter and that the prime rib is fatty and gross. Usually at a buffet I try just a tiny bit of anything that intrigues me, and that absolutely gorge on whatever I liked. Here, there was NOTHING that I wanted any more of. Hell, I didn't even finish the tiny bits I put on my plate. To top it off, it costs $23 plus tax. On the low average for dinner buffets in vegas, but not even close to being worth it. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. By the way, I didn't like it and everything was gross."
0,"Blue Martini is okay, there's nothing incredibly special about it. Being seated took a long time (we had bottle service), the waitresses took forever to place our orders and then bring them out. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Flatbread and it was decent but came out cold. My mom ordered the beef meal and her was cold and under seasoned. Whatever, we can deal. Drinks came. I had a lapse of judgement and ordered the oreos martini. Way too sweet for my liking. \n\nIt was crowded and people looked like they were having a good time. We only came here to get started and left around 12. \n\nAlthough my experience wasn't terrible, I just don't feel the need to come back."
1,"Love this place for the decor and fun vibes. The board games are perfect to go with casual dinner and beer. Service was good, friendly and accommodating. Salmon was overcooked, but I got thumbs up from the goulash and burger. The ketchup and garlic potatoes stole the show. Would come back definitely."
1,"Why Total Wine is better than Bevmo :\n\n1) Bevmo does not like you to get joy from being able to pick from rows and rows of single beers so you can build your own special pack\n2) organization \n3) About every beer you can buy in a 6 pack you can find on the \""single\"" shelves as well. Wait did i already state this?\n\nI love me a good beer tasting and Total Wine lets me go bananas with my choices.\n\nLove you TW&M !"
0,The coffee is pretty good depending on who is working. Not a place I'd recommend to hang out if you're looking to relax with friends.
1,"Well I have eaten here twice so I thought I would write my 2 cents worth.  So as others have said this place is simply a good Vietnamese restaurant in a 1950's diner.  Pretty cool actually as it is sort of a mindfuck.  Your brain is seeking  an egg creme or chocolate malt but instead it's three beans with shaved ice or Naem flan.  I like the juxtaposition of the two cultures!\n\nThere is I believe the owner guy who also serves as host and waiter.  He is very helpful and knows his regulars by name and food preferences.  That is usually a good sign.  There are two other female wait staff with various proficiencies in English but since the menu is all numbered ordering is a breeze. \n\nDuring my two visits I tried the lotus salad, the brisket pho, the seafood pho and the Naem flan.  All were good and very flavorful and there were plenty of extras to put into the pho.  I did notice that because of the current lime price increase you only get 1 wedge.  You have to nicely negotiate for another.  But plenty of basil, bean sprouts & sliced jalape\u00f1os.\n\nThe lotus salad is a nice combination of shredded pork and lengthwise sliced shrimp with lotus shoots in a spicy vinegar basil dressing.  It is a great dish but since it' s a large app it easily feeds two or as a solo diner you will be doggy baggin some of it home as the next day it tastes even better.\n\nThe pho's were both very good with great depth of flavor and taste.  Over all a really nice place."
0,"The food is good. However, the service is super slow. they lose a lot of business because they can't  manage the lunch rush.  I  have visited several times and every time its the same thing.  Expect your order to take forever I can't say it enough."
0,"What is with the good reviews? I swear this woman must pay these people to write them. The place is discusting. Absolutely dreadful. The place is old and towels hang up to block the mess of the kitchen in the back. The food is in old equipment from the 70s and the owner wears these soft hand casts that look like they havent been washed in years. The bottles on the tables literally have crust on them like they havent been washed and the atmosphere is old and moldy.\n\nThe food is way overpowered by spices to cover up the lack of quality in the meats and vegetables. I am all for spicy food but I could not even finish my meal. I've gone to this place 3 times now and figured I had a bad batch and that I needed to try other things to figure out what these reviews were all about. Nope! Every time I left dissapppinted. Even the Naan is fake! She buys store bought cheap pita bread. \n\nSeriously I'm surprised that she passes the health inspection. If you want good indian food, Id try going to the buffets on 6th ave. Definitely way better bang for your buck. And your not questioning what is in your food."

0,"I love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  Carnevino in the Venetian put me off making fun of Mario Batali forever.  His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  \n\nA friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\nI think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nSorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune."

1,My wife and I were vacationing in Vegas and although we had day passes to the spa at aria decided to look for massages elsewhere because massages on the strip we're ridiculously expensive. To sum it up the ratio of time to expense isn't a great value on the strip. My wife and I decided to yelp in hopes of procuring a better deal when we came across the highly reviewed Reflecting Hands Massage. Everything lined up with what we were looking for. Do keep in mind this place is off strip but worth the drive which is 10-15 mins depending on traffic and where on the strip your staying. Taylor and Jackie did an excellent job for a fraction of the cost of massages on the strip and the best part was the session was 90 minutes. Talk about a great value. I HIGHLY recommend if your visiting Vegas or even a local looking for a good massage that you check one of these two out. They set up the couples massage for My Wife and I. Taylor H was my masseuse and she did an excellent job. She was very attentive in making sure I was comfortable as well. It was so relaxing and refreshing I was smooth for the rest of the week we were there. My wife was also very pleased with the massage she received from Jackie. We both look forward to the next trip as we try and get out to Vegas about twice a year. Reflecting Hands Massage will definitely be on the agenda.

1,"I love this restaurant. I order the same thing every time. \nI wish I could try something different, but I miss my favorites when I am not here. \nThe Steak Cobb Salad, and the Chicken Salad are my favorite. \nThe bread pudding is fantastic, as well as the banana dessert, although I order it with a side of milk chocolate and puddle it all over. \nIts time for another visit. :)"
1,Best CheeseBurgers in the East Valley !  Service by there employees is always above and beyond !
1,"MacTaggarts is the best. Enough said. \n\nThe prices are a little steep, but that's understandable based on where they're located. They have pretty much everything you could ask out of a neighborhood market: cool tunes, great employees, and Boar's Head everything. \n\nThey have an underrated selection of different micro-brews as well, which is (imho) a huge plus. \n\nOnly thing you need to look out for is their half step coming up and down the stairs (if and when you're there, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about). \n\nStay cool \""tags\"""
0,"Found this place through Groupon, stopped by to grab dinner. Had a few customer service issues redeeming my deal, mostly pertaining to the receipt- face value of my deal was for $18, yet I only received credit for $15.36 and somehow owed about $2. Employees were unable or unwilling to explain why the transaction happened this way.\n\nIn any case, the food was fairly tasty.\nBeef tagine seems to be a frequent special, and it smells amazing. Taste isn't quite as delicious as the smell though, but I did appreciate that the dish was served on a bed of rice and with a drink (though they didn't give me mine). Beef itself is on the dry side, but it's a saucy dish so it did not ruin the meal.\nThe chicken shwarma salad is decent: moist chicken and fresh veggies, but a bit too much rice for my liking turned it into more of a bowl. Tahini dressing was on the bland side and slightly chalky. They charge 50 cents to add a tablespoon of feta to your dish- and they literally measure out it with a spoon, which is bizarre and stingy to me.\n\nI wouldn't hurry to rush back, largely because of their lack of transparency with billing, but there are so many other places that do Mediterranean in Vegas that I'd rather try another. I can say though, if you are craving beef tagine specifically, this place will probably hit the spot- flavors are correct, but hope it was just an off day for the meat."
0,Food undercooked. No ventilation in the space. My coat reminded me of the unpleasant experience for weeks..
1,"Just moved to the area and decided to try this place out.  I'll start by saying this is not a place to go and sit down to eat. There are only about 6 small tables and it was extremely hot!\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I split a chicken parm sub and a feta and spinach calzone. The sub was good. The bread was soft and fresh. The calzone was ok. We added chicken to it, but it was overloaded with spinach. I would have prefered more mozzarella and feta cheese. We tried a cannoli for dessert, delicous! The shell was the perfect balance of crunchy and soft, which is the reason this place earned the 4th star.\nI will certainly try Nick's again for their pizza, they offer free delivery within a 3 mile radius!"
0,Took them half hour to get me pollo loco n las Vegas rolls. The couple that arrived after me received there food first. I did not appreciate it at all !
1,"Went here a couple of times to get a shave, taper (haircut) and relax/treat myself. I love it here. Ferrell is one of the barbers there and he's awesome. His clients include a lot of professional athletes in Charlotte and beyond. He definitely knows what he's doing. \n\nIt's a cool spot to buy products for grooming. The barber shop area is in a separate room and is decorated to give it a very old timey, but classy feel. You really feel like they've turned back the clock in that room. It's super clean. The only thing is that when you get a cut the barbers chair faces the mall so people can see you. I personally like that aspect, but some shy folks might not. It's a fun, relaxing experience. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try fellas, especially the shave. \n\nThe haircut is a bit on the pricey side. But I'd still recommend giving the shave/cut a try to treat yourself!"
0,"Ladies bathroom disgusting. Utensils and dishes given to us were pulled out from the dishwasher in midwash still covered in a film of oil and some food particles.  Asked the server to exchange them and came back with \""new\"" utensils that were in the same condition.  Found a hair in my food.  Ok I'm Chinese and I know all the really good Chinese food places are not always the best in sanitation.  At least keep your damn dishes clean!  Customers notice this stuff and they'll start looking for more flaws.  So gross.  Never coming back."
0,"I come here a lot for smoothies, but have never tried the food here, so we decided today was the day that we'd try one of their wraps...boy what a mistake that was. I ordered 2 smoothies and a Jamaican jerk wrap. The smoothies came out about 5 min after I ordered them, at which point I sat down and figured the food would take a while longer to make...\n\n20 min later and they still haven't called my name, and I started noticing customers that ordered after us being called up to get their food orders, which was not a good sign. I went up to the counter to ask about my order and when the employee saw my receipt, she had a confused look upon her face and rushed to the back to check the order screen. She never came back and appeared to be rushing to make my order. Then another employee approaches the counter to see what was wrong and acknowledged that I had been waiting a while. I told her I had been waiting 20 min and still didn't have my order. I asked her for a refund if my wrap hadn't been made yet, since we had to get back to work, and she immediately took 7 bucks and some change out of the register and handed it to me.\n\nLong story short, we waited 20 min and had to go back to work with no food in hand. This place is great for smoothies but I would recommend staying away from the food orders because you'll be waiting a while, if you even get anything at all!"
0,"The pizza is just ok at its best, and the wings, though small, are decent.  There's lots of really good pizza in Vegas and Broadway doesn't quite make the cut but it's close to home and offers take out or delivery, service is pretty good."
0,"I couldn't tell you how the food is which is unfortunate. I placed an order for carry out on their website that told me it would take an hour. I thought it was strange, but I waited and headed out with 15min to spare. On my way I got a call from the girl working the front desk asking if I was going to be coming to pick up my order. After I explained the time frame I received from the site she then told me it was still on daylight savings. Uh.......\n\nSo I of course asked if it had been sitting out a long time and if it would be cold and soggy. \""Uh, well...let me ask my manager if we can make you a new order\"". I waited 5min on hold for her to tell me her manager said no, but they strill asked if would I be coming.  To pick up my order she basically just told me was cold and disgusting? They had to be kidding.  I opted out and headed to the best fall back anyone could ask for....buffalo wild wings!"
1,I loved the ice coffee and everything I've ordered here has been fantastic!\nIs my go to breakfast joint while in this area.
1,"The patio is great for peolple watching and the beer is cold.  I see some here who didn't like the food, but it never crossed my mind to ever eat there.  Just drink and have a good time"
1,"Baked Brie. It was amazing. Yes, I said amazing which is not a word I'm a fan of because I think it is kind of ordinary but it really was. I have never had brie that was so good. It came with these great home-made crackers. I think I've only had crackers out of a Nabisco box. Freaking awesome.\n\nWe also started with the calamari which was good and I believe the bread was fantastic too.\n\nThis review is of course written much later than it should have been so I can't remember everything that clearly.\n\nOur entrees were great as was the dessert. I got the Coconut Cream Cake which was from a local bakery. Delicious. The waitress was awesome and said that if I didn't like it, she'd just get me something else. She didn't have the chance to because I ate it so fast!\n\nI want to mention the waitress again. She was very sweet and I felt almost like I was in someone's home which was a nice feeling.\n\nI recommend this place but you must promise to order the Brie. Be careful because they mean it when they say the plate is hot!"
0,"Absolutely disappointed.  When your primary product is pizza and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.  Unfortunately for me, Grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.  While my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.  This evening I ordered a pizza to-go which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.  Not so.  My son and I stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.  Then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the two girls who were handling take out orders away from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.  Mind you, this is in the midst of a Sunday night take out rush.  After the second girl got her \""talking to\"" I watched as she tried to compose herself (unsuccessfully) and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.  That left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the to-go traffic since the Manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her \""talks\"" with the to-go staff.  The remaining girl jumped between calls while to-go orders piled up below her counter.  I had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzas was mine, since I had now been waiting over 25 minutes, but I had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes the girl started checking the pizzas and, just as I had assumed, brought me mine from the pile.  When I told her that I knew that this pizza had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame excuse that it was very busy tonight.   \nI have at least 5-10 other pizza places I pass on my way to this place and Grimaldis just gave me an excuse to either try the others again or give them a first try before I return to this place."
0,"DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure."
1,I never have to worry about walking out of here with a hairdo I want to pull a sock on for the next six weeks. I like these people! I use Genevieve quite a bit. Every person there is fascinating to talk with. Good peoples. And that thing about not having to put a sock on your head? Priceless. Every cut our family has had has been a good one.
1,"Been here almost a dozen times; always satisfied and no complaints. \nService is always good,  the food and drinks are  always tasty,  ambiance is kick back,  today(Sunday late  afternoon) they had a two- man band that is awesome to listen to, and it's never over- crowded or too loud like their sister restaurant,  Gallo Blanco.  \nYou can't go wrong with their menu, it's simple to understand and well thought out! A must try!"
0,Truck would not start so got a jump from my Son and drove straight over. 20 minutes later was told it was an alternator and the battery was marginal at best so it would have to be replaced. Quote was for $680...? i did not have the confindence level that they knew what the problem was and they also did not have the part. On the way home i stopped at local Autozone to pick up a jump start battery and asked if they had the part and they did. I called Firestone and was told they called the local store and were told they did not have it available? Then i saw the price it was $230 less than the quote they gave me for exactly same part. Needless to say at this point i had no trust. \n\nTook it to dealership that monday not an alternator issue just needed battery replaced. $160.

0,"I went in for glasses and they could not get it right.  I saw both the male and female docs too.  They kept sending the glasses out to get fixed.  This is the first place in the 40 years I've worn glasses where they had to send it out again and again to get it right and it's still not right so I'm going elsewhere.  This is ridiculous.  I found out from a lens maker that some docs pay more for lens makers who get it right the first time, but this company does not so they're trying to make a buck by taking up your time with a cheaper lens manufacturer.  They're in an expensive location so they're trying to appear like quality, but now that I know the secret, no thanks."

1,"There are good waxers then there are exceptional ones such as Trish at The Pretty Kitty. After trying various studio, including Box which I went to several times,  I must say that my experience at The Pretty Kitty cannot be beat. \n\nHere's what I love...Trish is great. She's down to earth, friendly and makes you feel very comfortable. She is also very fast and efficient which is always nice. The pain is very minimal with the mix of waxes she uses and on top of all that, the prices are the most reasonable I have  seen. Trish has also been great about educating me on the world of waxing, such as don't let your waxer double dip! Also, all of her girls are trained the same way ensuring no matter who you see you always get the same consistant job. \n\nI started visiting Trish over a year ago and will stop to see her anytime I'm back in Las Vegas or San Diego."
1,"Had a service issue but owner handled very professionally.  The food is very good, and have eaten there many times!  Being able to smoke cigars on back patio is a great add!"
1,"I am absolutely obsessed with this place. I ate here on my first trip to Vegas a few years ago and got hooked right away. I've been making this a vegas tradition ever since.\n\nTheir spicy cilantro lo mein is ridic. It's a fusion of asian and peruvian - althought it doesn't advertise itself that way. But having grown up on peruvian food I recognize the ingredients they're borrowing.\n\nThey also have some over-sized beer bottles that will make people do a double take when they see you walking around the casino with it.\n\nI'm a fan. And since I took my wife there this year, I think she's one now, too."
0,Ive been there 2 times and thats about 2 times too many.    Not a big fan.

1,Quite gem hidden in China Town. Food is good and priced well for Vegas. Definitely on the list of must visit when in Vegas.
1,"We went on a very busy Friday night.  Crazy busy, but a fun atmosphere, \""real\"" people, and great energy.  We have an excellent margarita while waiting.  There's a local band playing music- and they are very good.\n\nWe are seated after about 35 minutes.  We are under speaker so the music is so loud we can't talk.  Service staff is very friendly and professional, but also very busy.  Excellent bread and olive dip is delivered.  \n\nWe order pork tacos and Pollo Poblano dinners.  Our food is prepared well.  Quality is excellent.  But our water glasses are empty for far too long, too often.  It was loud to a fault- likely a combo of acoustics, voices and speaker location.  I like me my loud music, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation at dinner.\n\nThe patrons as a whole appeared to be enjoying themselves.  There is a broad cross-section of people, variety of ages, ethnicities, friends, couples, groups, etc.  I enjoy a diverse crowd, and everyone was good-natured, which adds to the charm of this small and very busy restaurant.  Parking is tight but i've never experienced any damage in the back.  \n\n I've been a couple times before, and consistently experience a 4 or 5 rating experience.  This is the first time I've reviewed, and wish I could give a 5-star, but no-go.  \n\nYes I will return, but not during one of the busiest times of the week.  No reservations, so be prepared to wait."
0,I went to this hotel and I will NEVER stay here. The female/male who was working the desk was a total bitch. Plus over charge for stuff snacks!! Friend was staying here and she didn't like the person who was working the desk. Not a welcome feeling at this hotel.
1,"This is a great little entertainment and shopping area. There are a lot of Superplex choices in North Scottsdale and I like the downtown city/urban feel of Scottsdale Quarter. You can walk the entire complex (round-trip) in 10 minutes, yet there are enough shops and restaurants to last all day.\n\nIt's not at 100% occupancy so there is still some minimal construction going on, but it's nothing that gets in the way of a great time.\n\nThe only downer is the parking. Just go directly to the below ground parking structure. Street parking is non-existent unless you want to Valet. Also, access to Scottsdale Rd is limited to one exit.\n\nThe minor parking issues are far outweighed by everything else SQ has to offer. It is now on my list of places to go during the weekend!"
0,MY REAL STAR RATING IS 0 STARS\n\nI will make this review very quick.... I wasn't expecting this food to be bursting with flavor and just out of sight delicious.... I was expecting it to be good average Chinese food..... I was totally wrong..... \n\nI called in my order for delivery and I ordered sweet and sour chicken and the Hunan beef with an extra egg roll and it came with crab puffs.... Lets first start off with the sweet and sour chicken..... It was drenched in sweet and sour sauce and the sauce was way too sweet....it had huge chunks of pineapples in it.... it was soggy and disgusting..... I prefer to have my sweet and sour sauce on the side.... \n\nThe Hunan beef was nasty it was dry and cold and it wasn't spicy at all.... The veggies were Blah.... The crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls.... They weren't even egg rolls they were more like spring rolls but they still sucked..... They were horrible...!!!!! The worst egg rolls I ever ate in my life.... I would prefer Panda Express any day over this place.... The rice was dry and disgusting....\n\nThis food made me sick.... After eating just a couple bites a few minutes later .... My body immediately rejected it and it upset my stomach really badly.... I ended up releasing the food immediately through a bowel movement.... My body has never reacted like that before.... It felt like I had rocks in my tummy.... I felt weak and nausea and I believe I had a very short case of food poisoning..... Thank God I only ate a few bites...  or I probably would have been sick for a couple days.... \n\nMy suggestion is that they need to be closed down.... THEIR FOOD IS HORRIFIC....!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"We finally were able to taste one side of Raku! \n\nIt is a dessert bar, could have quite a wait and everything is made right in front of you. Being part of a 5-person group, we ordered three different desserts off of the prix fixe menu, which was edible and came with a nice raspberry sauce."
0,"First impression of Kaba Curry was not good. Our little family walked in an hour and a half before closing and all we saw was a HUGE group of guys waiting for their meal. And when I say huge, I mean they took up like half the restaurant. I knew we were going to have somewhat of a wait because there were no plates in front of them. There wasn't a sign that said to seat yourself, so we waited by the counter. There was a man behind the counter talking to another man (one of the patrons) and I'd say it took a good FIVE minutes for him to even acknowledge us..... and we were standing right in front of him. My boyfriend gave me the \""let's just walk out\"" look but this place has been blasting my IG newsfeed so I wanted to see the hype. \n\nWhen we were finally able to order, there was a list of stuff they had ran out of, so we had to rethink our decisions. (ugh) We waited a good 20-25 minutes for our food but it was nice and piping hot. The curry was OK. I think we prefer Indian curry so it may just be a preference thing. My BF ate the food, but I don't think he'll want to eat it again. The concept is great and they offer very creative toppings and sides to go along with the curry, but like I said, it may just be a preference thing. I would give the food a 3/4 but have to downgrade to a 2 because of the initial service. Perhaps I'll visit again and update after....."
0,"I went to this place a year ago because my regular optometrist in Scottsdale moved overseas.  Terrible.  I even scheduled my appointment online 2 days prior and STILL had to wait 90 minutes.  The so called \""optometrist\""  briefly looked at my chart and asked \""what's the reason for your appointment today - did your scrip expire?\""  I said it is called an ANNUAL exam.\n\nTHEN she insisted that i needed bifocals - and I explained to her that my eyes were simply exhausted from studying (16 units) and late nights.  She totally did not listen to me and said well then we will just give you regular glasses and then you will have to buy your own bifocals.\n\nshe did NOT check the general health of my eyes NOR did she ask for the reason behind why they were obviously IRRITATED.\n\nI advised her that only 1 brand of contacts works for me (cooper vision torics) and she gave me a prescription for a completely different brand.  The brand irritated my eyes and one month later she would NOT change the prescription - 6 months later the brand was recalled and they did not issue replacements or change the prescription.  I basically had 1 year of crappy contacts because I was laid off and had to stick it out. The 2 for $69 deal is a bait and switch - and they try to sell you on the membership upgrade - garbage.  i wrote to their customer service and they had NO response.  Also, they would not give you a physical prescription to get the contacts elsewhere until you bought at least ONE box in house.\n\nCHOP SHOP.\n\nI am grateful to them - because this year instead of taking my chances on another crappy eyeglass place I went and got lasik surgery.\n\nThanks you hack."
0,"The first line of your response says that you suggested that I DO NOT get it replaced, but continue using it. In the very next line, you say that the phone was unusable. What does that tell me about your credibility??\n\nWhile I respect your advice, you need to realize that it is my phone and my money, so once I decide to get it replaced, all YOU as a person who repairs it need to tell me is whether you are competent enough to get it done in a professionally acceptable manner. You were not doing me any favors by getting it fixed at the agreed price. I was PAYING YOU. And the $10 deal on Yelp is part of the price you advertised. So that was no discount!! Once you agreed to get it fixed, you needed to play by the rules, which you clearly did not!! You put on a wrong screen and most importantly you did not take care of my phone which I entrusted you with.\n\nLet me tell you why I'm not accepting your offer to get the case replaced. How would you feel if some guy took your phone, scraped and scratched the casing and then offered to fix it if you were willing to pay for it. You took a perfectly fine phone (except for the hairline crack) and scraped and scratched the heck out out of it. And now you're trying to get more business from me?? You try to put the blame on me saying the phone was useless after the fall. You don't even know what happened to the phone and yet you make seemingly credible remarks. Bringing it once to you was a mistake. Your same incompetent \""technician\"" is still going to fix this phone if I ever return and I'd never let him repair another phone of mine. This is the same reason why I did not take the offer to get my old screen back on, cos I could not imagine what ELSE he would end up doing to my phone while he took off the current screen and put on the old one. \n\nAnd finally, a word to you. You run this place. And yet, not once but TWICE you delivered a product to a customer which was WAY below the standard of a deliverable. If you really took pride in your business, you'd have reviewed your technician's work and got him to do quality work BEFORE a product was delivered to the customer. Both the times, when you handed over the phone to me, you seemed to have barely taken a glance at the condition in which my phone was being returned to me, which as a customer is something that I cannot digest. When you told me  \""I don't know, my technician did it\"", you lost my trust as a customer. \n\nI'm done doing business with you!"
0,Sorry...this place is no good.  Fish was not fresh...server gave me trouble when I tried to make a minor change to a roll...I have felt pretty sick the last 24 hours as well.   Stay away and go a few extra blocks and spend a few extra bucks at Naked Fish
1,"Had a business lunch today at District and I cannot say enough about it. The restaurant itself is beautiful, especially the outdoor area. Our service (we had Ken taking care of us) was impeccable both in method and attitude. \n\nThe food was stellar, and my lunch guest is a chef, so she is picky. Warning--sandwiches don't come with fries, so if you want them, order them as a side. I had the chicken panini and my guest had the shortrib sandwich and we were both very pleased. I will note that I would suggest asking for a bread substitution on the shortrib sandwich--I thought ciabatta would have been a better choice. \n\nAll in all, a great experience. I was concerned about being underdressed in jeans, and while most people were dressed for business, there was nothing snooty about this place. Very elegant yet inviting atmosphere. The hostess was charming, and a manager stopped by our table to check in, which is always appreciated. \n\nI work next door, and will definitely be back for Happy Hour in the future! I heard a rumor that they have an apricot beer I need to try..."
0,"FYI... Although Yelp says its good for kids, it is not. There is a sign on the door at the hostess stand that says no children under the age of 6 are allowed."
0,"I wish I hadn't eaten at L'Etoile; my expectations were set way too high. The food was spotty (tasty egg dishes, overly salty salad, heavy beignets), but it was the service that was most disappointing. The wait staff appeared to have too many tables, as tables weren't turned over quickly, and there were long spells between refills or check-ins. The hostesses were probably the worst though; grossly inaccurate waiting time estimates, fibs about having called cells and a general unfriendly attitude. \n\nIf I didn't know for a fact this was related to the best restaurant in town, I wouldn't believe it.\n\nUpdated for non locals: when I say related to the best restaurant in town, I am referring to L'Etoile, a Madison institution."
1,"Sadly, I have had the opportunity to use Good Night Pediatrics 3 times in the last month.  I say sadly not because of the care but because this is not where one would like to be, an urgent care.  \n\nIf you have to go to an urgent care for your children in the middle of the night I cannot say enough good things about these people.  They are pretty quick, MUCH faster than an ER would be, and they have always been helpful.  The woman doctor there, I have never gotten her name, is VERY nice!  She is great at explaining what is wrong without being condescending.  I am sure I will be back again before the winter is over."
0,"What can I say? Just not impressed. For all the hype I've heard about this place and numerous good reviews I was just disappointed. \n\nLet me start with the good. I went here for a friend's birthday dinner. My friend and I showed up early before the rest of our group. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Here's the good: our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny. My friend doesn't drink much so he gave her a hard time (but it was all in good fun). He was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol, and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which I enjoyed. He also made some shots for myself and my friend (didn't charge us, very nice of him!). I also asked him to make a drink that was \""purple\"". Based on the fact that my friend who was having the birthday's favorite color is indeed, purple. He obliged. So basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender. Wish I remembered his name.\n\nLet's get on to the BAD. This place is supposed to be Americanized Tapas I guess. When we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around. He took drink orders, but then took FOREVER to come back to take our food order. Also, there was a hub-bub about the all you can eat special. Some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat, and some did not. The waiter refused to let us do that. RIDICULOUS. Just because my friend wants to do all-you-can-eat and I do not does not mean you should refuse someone. They acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having all-you-can-eat. We even explained that we were locals, and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment. We all ended up just ordering without the all you can eat.\n\nI had the fish tacos which were bland and boring. They came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de gallo. Nothing else, not even a hot sauce or sour cream. I also had the PB&J which I felt was okay, but nothing to rave over. I think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.\n\nIf you want tapas in Las Vegas go to Firefly. At lest you'll get REAL tapas with decent portions, and you won't be made to follow their silly rules, which I think are probably made up there because they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the AYCE, even if someone in the party doesn't want to.\n\nIf you're looking for good cocktails and you'd like to see a bit of a show (they do flare) than JS may be good, but go somewhere else for tapas!! You will be happy you did."
0,"Unfortunately, you are limited to where you can dine at Terminal 2 in the Phoenix airport for breakfast.  Fast food or this steaming pile of dog poop.\n\nDirty... tables aren't wiped.  The servers clear food off the tables onto the floor using their hands.  Nice.\n\nExtremely limited breakfast menu.  Yes, they have eggs.  But only scrambled.  Paper plates and plasticware so thin make sure you get a few extra sets as the first set will surely break.\n\nSurlly, disheveled, and disgruntled employees.\n\nYou're better off down the hall at Round Table pizza for breakfast.  At least it's clean!"
0,"A WORD OF CAUTION:  \nWhen I left the restaurant, I paid for my dinner with a credit card.  Two weeks later when I received my monthly credit card statement, I realized Havana Cafe did a DOUBLE CHARGE on the credit card!  I called, and initially accounting stated that it was not a double charge, \""that it just looked that way\"".  I called Visa, and the second charge was immediately removed. \nI spoke with the owner - she apologized and offered me a mere 15% discount on my next meal, which I thought was rather tacky.\nWord to the wise: examine your credit card statements, as Havana caf\u00e9 was not about to call me!"
1,Always great tacos and XX amber.
0,"We bought our master king bedroom set with a mattress ( over 6k spent in this store) from the Bassett store in Concord. Had a pleasant experience with Donna, the sales person/interior designer. We paid in full. We were told delivery would be in one truck. To anticipate the 8AM delivery, we emptied the master bedroom and even got rid of our old mattress. Delivery was on time yet missing ONE BIG ITEM...the king mattress!! We called Bassett and spoke to April G. Instead of working towards a plan to help us she blatantly told us two lies. First excuse, there was no room on the truck. Second excuse, \""you were notified your delivery would be a partial delivery today\"" and that Saturday your mattress would come. Surprisingly, we both work Saturday so how in the world would we have scheduled a delivery that day. The part that really upsets us is not the poor planning, but how obnoxious, rude, and condescending April G. was. Therefore, Bassett furniture has lost a costumer for life and we will tell everyone we know of this HORRIBLE experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T SHOP HERE!!!!!--from Rost and Bianca from Huntersville, NC"
0,"The food is mediocre and the service is poor. Most of the servers don't have initiative when it comes to refilling beverages, removing used plates from the table and no teamwork. I asked one server if I could get another set of silverware. The server just looked at me and called to another server that worked in our section. No courtesy and no acknowledgment."
1,This was our first time at Chelsea's Kitchen. We sat outdoors on the patio for an early lunch under the shady trees. The servers were friendly and the food was everything people have said it would be. The short rib tacos are seriously delicious. And the kale salad is an experience in gourmet wonderment. We also had the swordfish tacos--delightful. We will most certainly be back.
1,"The atmosphere at Hillstone, no matter which city or location, is always great!  Contemporary, sophisticated vibe in upscale room makes me want to return.  I ate by myself at the bar, but enjoyed chatting with the bar tender and the person next  to me.  I recommend the seared ahi!"
0,"5-27-13 Memorial Day. We were the first people in the restaurant at 6am. I ordered huevos rancheros and my friends ordered biscuits and gravy. All three of our orders came out luke warm at best. We were the first orders in, no one else was in the restaurant. $41 for breakfast was not worth it. Did we tell our server you may ask? No we did not. We are in the industry as well and didn't want to be a bother. The service was fine but the food was sub par. In my experience in the restaurant industry I understand mistakes happen, orders are messed up, and food is sometimes cold. However when you are the very first order of the day there is no excuse."
1,"Everything I put in my mouth at Hula's was amazing. Started off with a blood orange margarita, tart but loved it. Then The Volcano was delivered to our party of 8. It tasted like jungle juice and served family-style. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top and sweet potato fries. I think the fries were my favorite, then the coleslaw, and the pork last. It was all tasty though. Since it was a friend's birthday, they brought their signature sundae which was heavenly. Vanilla ice cream with macadamia nuts mixed in, topped with toasted coconut and other stuff. Overall, pretty stoked with my food choices. Server was awesome until we asked to split the check. She should have asked first! Just a little 'tude but oh we'll. Definitely want to go back and try other deliciousness."
1,"I would say that I prefer the Mesa location simply because it tends to be quieter but this one is within walking distance for me so it's often the one I go to.  Plus I like sitting out out by the lake when the temperature finally becomes reasonable.\n\nI was reading the previous reviews and a lot of people have had problems with the service but I've never had anything but wonderful service here.  I've eaten here during busy and slow times and the service has always been pretty consistant.  The food is excellent and, I think, appropriately priced.  I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare.   I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.  I do eat fish occasionally so my only sadness is that they stopped carrying the Tuna Melt Pizza which was to die for.  Maybe they'll bring it back someday.......can you hear me Pita Jungle?"
1,"We went in around noon. But they let us to order breakfast because we told them we were craving breakfast. My mom and I ordered Tableau Breakfast. It came with a basket of pastry which tasted like just coming out of oven. I chose sausages with my eggs. The sausages were really tasted. Best sausages I ever had in U.S. The scamble eggs were just normal but the portion was huge. I didn't finish my eggs. The hash brown was not your normal hash brown....but in a good way.....it shaped like small cakes and the texture of them were really special and very delicated. i think it's not easy to make a plain old hash brown taste delicated. But the best part came after I asked for Ketchup for my hash brown. I was expecting a bottle of Hein's ketchup....but no....they gave me a cup of fresh-made ketchup....that kinda blew me away......well... .at that point....I finially realized what is fine dining for breakfast....\nThe fresh-made ketchu tasted so good and so fresh....I finished my hash brown cakes just because I wanted to have the ketchup.  anyway.....the taste and quality of the food totally worth the price. In my opinion, the breakfast we could order to our room can't compare with breakfast I had in Tableau, althought they price about the same. \n\nBesides, at Tableau, I can enjoy the good view, excellent serivce, silver tableware, and fresh-made ketchup... :P"
1,"My family and I came here to celebrate a birthday. I'm a fan of al fresco dining but my sister isn't. Our table was by the window overlooking the pool/patio area...and I was wishing I were outside.\n\nWe were presented with a glass case on wheels with their fresh (and moving) seafood. Their seafood comes straight from Italy which may explain the prices. Of all nights not to be in the mood for seafood, I had to pick the night we went here. We got the lasagnette, gnocchi, pollo alla Riviera Ligure, filetto and brodetto di pesce (my bro-in-law got this but he doesn't like to share his food or have pics taken of his food so, I'll be skipping this). For dessert we got budino di cioccolato, zabaglione ghiacciato, granite and gelato.\n\nLasagnette con Rag\u00f9 di Crostacei:\nPasta sheets with shrimp, lobster, crab in white wine and tomato. Quite tasty and you can definitely taste fresh seafood. 4/5\n\nGnocchi di Patate con Fonduta di Pomodoro:\nPotato gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce with basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano. I love gnocchi and this had the perfect texture and consistency. The sauce was simple but amazing. 5/5\n\nPollo alla Riviera Ligure:\nRoast chicken with asparagus, artichokes, porcini, olives in lemon herb sauce. Perfectly cooked. Moist chicken quarters with crispy skin. Great sauce. 5/5\n\nFiletto di manzo al Sangiovese:\nSeared beef filet with potato puree, carrots and rabe in red wine sauce. Tender and perfectly medium-rare. Not very flavorful and not worth $54. 3/5\n\nBudino di Cioccolato e Banana, Gelato di Banana:\nWarm chocolate-banana custard and banana gelato. 4/5\n\nZabaglione Ghiacciato al Torrone al Cioccolata Amaro e Arancia:\nFrozen torrone sabayon, dark chocolate, orange and orange zest. There are two things I don't like combined with chocolate: mint and orange. I was not ersponsible for getting this and I did not like it. 2/5\n\nGelati & Granite:\nPick 6 sorbet (black currant, lemon, mango, coconut, apricot, raspberry)/ gelato (vanilla, banana, espresso, gianduja, pistachio, amarena, rosemary, chocolate, nocciola, zabaglione, croccantini al cioccolato)/ granite (moscato, pineapple, blood orange, strawberry proseco) flavors.  For my 6, I chose banana, gianduja, nocciola and pistachio gelati +  moscato and strawberry proseco granite. I love everything I picked but my favorites were gianduja (chocolate and hazelnut), nocciola (hazelnut), moscato and strawberry proseco. 5/5\n\nThe bread service was unremarkable. We got complimentary petit fours after dinner and dessert: chocolates with caramel and tea inside.\n\nTruffles are in season for a limited time at $90/dish (October-November...possibly early December). They have a dress code so, please don't come in casual wear."
1,"Good pho for cheap in downtown, what else do you need?  Well, service was a little off, but honestly, I don't know if they should even have servers.  I could just as easily buy my drinks at the counter and bus my own table.\n\nI'm not going to tell you its amazing, because it isn't.  At $6.75 a small bowl and $8.50 a large bowl though, who cares.  I'm not sure if there is a better deal downtown.  The small should be plenty enough for most people's lunch.  Of course I had to go big though.\n\nAll the basic accoutrements, fresh basil, extremely crispy bean sprouts, and some sliced jalapeno came out quickly.  Something to snack on while you wait I guess.  It only took 5 minutes for the pho though.  I liked it more than Pho Real, but not quite up there with Ben Thahn, Vietnam Grille, and the like.  It just didn't have quite the depth of flavor.  That said, no complaints on the food.  I did spend some time without water and they weren't even very busy.\n\nBottom line is, I will tell every living soul that I know downtown about this place while its cold out.  People need to know."
1,I love their seafood tofu soup! I always order it when I go there to eat with my friends or family :)
0,"This place sucks. I wasn't let in because I had a temporary drivers license that I had got 2 days ago in Texas. I also had a had copy of my Texas security license, and my old i.d card from texas. All issued by the dmv, all with the same picture and DOB. Apparently the state of Arizona doesnt accept real licenses....it wouldnt be so bad, but the \""security\"" were assholes."
0,"I have never written a review on yelp before but I feel compelled because of the horrible customer service I have experienced there. I have been going to their pharmacy for a year and they have never filled my prescription correctly, not once! Then when I call to tell them I wasn't given the appropriate amount of medication they act rude or frustrated with me. I have only had good customer service once or twice out of the multiple times I have gone. I do not recommend this pharmacy, both for its service and its customer relations."
1,"The place is good. Think of it as going to your neighbor's BBQ. This place isn't gourmet, but who cares. It taste like normal food over the standard commercialized food, which is an awesome change of pace.\n\nThe only thing I'd change is the amount of food. I got a Guac cheeseburger and fries and went back for a little one... and STILL was hungry. Ha!"
0,I stay at the Wynn 6-8 times a year. Lakeside was my first time visit. They only had 3 star review but I still decided to try with my wife and few friends. I was very disappointed when they brought me the bill it was $150 higher then we ordered it. Waitress immediately apologize and told me she is going to fix it but it has been 10 days and nothing got reversed...Stay away from Lakeside...
0,Hate hate hate going to this pharmacy. Staff constantly blaming anything to avoid responsibility. I ordered my refill on the computer for pickup Monday. Today is Wednesday & despite showing them the order confirmation email they still claim my refill was never ordered. This is just one of many examples. Will drive out of my way to avoid this store.
1,"I went recently for the second time to this theater.. I gotta say I am definitely a fan of it. I had bought a groupon for $5 movie tickets so I went with some friends. Parking at the epicenter was fairly easy and the movie theater validates so HELLO FREE PARKING! Coming here straight after work I was rather hungry so I ordered the BBQ Bacon cheeseburger which comes with fries. The burger was delicious! next time just ordering it without the onions (yuck). The fries were good but lacking a good portion size the whole thing was served in a cereal size bowl. I would have liked it on a plate and with MORE FRIES... server was only ok, his name was Lacy he just wasn't very nice.. didn't smile and then didn't bring me napkins when I ordered a burger and fries? I have to ask for napkins? ordered a Blue Margarita to go with it was good but there again the service was lacking. Overall I would definitely go again just next time ordering the popcorn!"
0,"If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back."
0,"Never again!  \n\nI would only hope the owner or someone in management takes the time to pay attention to the conversation going on about their business. Here's how your staff treats people, management included:\n\nThe second time I popped in for a drink I encountered the rudest bartender I have come across in ten years of living in Vegas. She treated me as if  I was the biggest inconvenience to her night because I had a question about a cocktail. She chatted with her other bartenders cheerfully but couldn't muster the energy to act like she enjoyed serving customers. She intentionally skipped me because I was being indecisive about a cocktail (uh, yeah, they ain't cheap by the way). The same night we were sitting at a table on the patio and we had extra chairs because other tables were unoccupied. The security guard came up to us and said that we were going to have to \""get up\"" because they needed the chairs. Okay, fair enough, we know we had chairs that belonged to other tables but is that how you ask someone? Wouldn't you advise the customer politely that there are other parties being seated instead of saying \""you guys have to get up\"". They sat a party for bottle service as if it would help them make the bottom line for the evening and no one else mattered. \n\nMy recent visit to Commonwealth (well, can't exactly qualify since they denied me entry) had me scratching my head. Our friends were inside CW so we were going to go in and meet them ( I did not particularly want to based on previous experiences). We were told the owner saw us do something outside and weren't allowed in because of it. I asked if we simply could know the reason why since I have patronized the business in the past. It's the least they could do is tell my why I was being denied. The manager, Brian, came out and then talked to one of the bouncers, Adam (cool dude by the way, no bad things to say about him, he actually understands customer service) and the managers first words to me were \""what's up? Why are you being a prick? You asked to talk to me and you see that I'm right here.\"" Excuse me????? \n\nMr/Mrs. Owner, if this is the people you entrust to run your bar, you are either not involved or don't give a crap or both. \n\nYelpers, maybe you want to stop in for a drink at a new downtown spot and that's fine. Do not expect friendly staff and know that they think everyone is a potential douchebag. \n\nDowntown Las Vegas is a thriving small community and is making huge progress towards bringing back culture and a sense of community. Commonwealth is not part of that effort."
1,"I brought my family here, seeing all the good reviews and I was not disappointed.\n\nWe had many first-time (child and adult) shooters, and the idea was to just get them some experience in firing a weapon.\n\nOur representative was Tito. I appreciated how he spent time with each of the children to guide them safely how to fire their 0.22s. Especially because the younger ones were scared and nervous about the noise as well as the fact they were wielding a firearm. With his help the kids overcame their fears and had a great time.\n\nThanks so much for helping this family reunion be a memorable one!"
0,"The food was good. All was great until I found a pubic hair in my turkey sandwich. NO!!!! Why!!! I'm ruined forever...... Can't go back, maybe for a juice drink"
1,"I had the wonderful pleasure of having lunch at Olives this past weekend. We were seated on the patio overlooking the Bellagio \""lake.\""\nWhile we were eating we were treated to the fountain shows. The only downside was that it was bloody hot, but there were water misters above the umbrellas and the waiters were good about re-filling your water glass.\n\nYOU MUST order the flatbread. Crisp and delicious and very good quality olive oil drizzled on top of course. We tried the prosciutto and fig variety. \nWe also had the grilled octopus and squid for appetizers. I wasn't to crazy about the crab cake sandwich that I had, but the other entrees ordered--lamb chops, grilled chicken breast, pulled pork and hamburger were great!!!\n\nGreat treat, definitely Vegas Worthy!"
1,"This isn't a place that you go a whole lot - but BOY are they helpful when you need them!\n\nI brought in my cordless phone that has some special battery internally that was slowly dying to the point that I could only talk on the phone for about 10 minutes per charge.  Not so fun.  I brought the phone here and the guy was super helpful to find the right battery that would work.  While I was there I saw folks getting batteries for SO many amazing and unique things. \n\nSo if you're looking for something a little more complex than a Duracell AA, you should give them a call.  And even if that's all you think you want - if you're in the area you might want to go by because based on what kind of product you're using it for, I heard them suggest different brands/types of AA battery.  Not something I normally want to think about - but handy to know."
1,"Dunkin Donuts is your quin essential chain donut store and it has finally arrived in Las Vegas! For many years our precious valley was a vast wasteland of Krispy Kreeme's and a few solid mom and pop's donut shops (see my review of Al's Donuts) but alas, Dunkin Donuts is here again (well they came like three years ago) and we can all rejoice in their great coffee, donuts and breakfast sandwiches. \n\nOne great thing about this location is their staff are very attentive and just all around nice. I have never been greeted by a more friendly drive-thru person then the girl who worked the morning shift a few days ago. Good times to that Dunkin!"
0,"Mandalay Bay has its major ups and its major downs...\n\nLet's start with the ups. \n\n-The restaurant choices are excellent. You can go hear great music at House of Blues or enjoy their Gospel Brunch on Sundays. Fleur and Aureole are spectacular and you have to check out the contraption that delivers the bottles of wine to you. I can't describe it, you just have to see it for your self.\n-Nice size rooms with large bathrooms. The shower is separate from the deep whirlpool bathtub and I always enjoy double sinks when traveling with my husband.\nDual closets is a plus-plenty of room to hang your nightlife attire with lots of available hangers.\n-the Bath House Spa at THEHotel (connected to Mandalay Bay) was AWESOME!! I could have stayed in there all day. I have been to several spas in my life and I would say this was one of the most unique spas to visit. If you go, you need to pay a visit to the Bath House spa.\n-Majority of the staff were pleasant to deal with (even when they were messing up, they remained smiling and would apologize numerous times about the inconvenience)\n\nNow the downs and believe me, there are some major downs..\n\n-room was dirty when we arrived. There were stains on the sheets and comforter and pistachio nut shells on the floor. eewww!\n-elevators are slow so don't wait until last minute to go anywhere\n-agree with other Yelpers that the casino area could use some updating\n-Now I talked about how much I loved the spa but be sure to note that it is expensive. I got a basic 45 minute pedicure there and it cost $80 plus tip and that was the cheapest pedicure possible. All the other ones with coconut cream, deluxe, etc were over $100. CRAZY!! If my lil piggies weren't in such dire need of new polish, I would have said Thanks, but No Thanks!!\n-Concierge staff are super nice but when I booked my tickets over the phone before coming to Vegas, the lady booked half of the tickets on the wrong date even though the itinerary they sent me had all the tickets confirmed for the correct date. Instead of giving me a $500 credit back on to my credit card, they said they could only apply a credit to my hotel bill. I wasn't thrilled with the idea but I figured that I would probably spend about that much on my room, other shows, food, spa etc so I didn't complain too much after they said twice it wasn't possible to credit my Visa back. Well.....when it was time to check out, they had only applied the credit to food and beverage at the hotel and therefore I still had almost $300 left on there. I told the lady checking me out that this was incorrect and that concierge said it could be applied to anything in the hotel (shopping, shows, the spa, etc). I stood at the Check out desk for almost an hour while that lady and her manager were trying to work it out. Their excuse was that Concierge was a different department and they didn't share the same account, yada yada yada. I told them that I was about to miss my flight now that I have been messing with this for so long. Told them to please just email me the receipt once it has been worked out so that I could leave for the airport. \n\nAnd of course, I get the receipt and view my credit card bill and GUESS WHAT..wait for it..wait for it... it is STILL incorrect... I am sure that it is going to require at least another hour long phone call to straighten it all out..."
0,"Spent 70 dollars and a mediocre pedicure and the WORST set of full nails I've ever gotten.  Within days they were lifting, and I had to go somewhere else to get a new set.  I will NEVER return or refer anyone to your establishment."
0,Average Chinese cuisine and way over-priced.
1,"Came in for check engine light and they checked it out for free and referred me to somewhere that could help, then also cleaned my front headlights and buffed them for free!"
1,"At the time I got my 3rd seaweed salad,  I was going to give this place 5 stars. However, my eyes can always handle more than my stomach. I took off a star because they don't allow you to waste good, meaning that you HAVE TO EAT EVERYTHING you order. So for those that are greedy, please heed my warnings and DO NOT OVER ORDER. Otherwise I feel like the all you can eat option is much better than ordering individual rolls, unless you're watching your figure. If you're craving sushi in Vegas, come here to get your fill."
0,"Good place to drink but don't bother eating here. Overcooked burger, overcooked scallops, standard deviled eggs but good butter lettuce. \n\nThe cubby service bartender is not friendly so stay away. \n\nWorth going for drinks..."
0,"The inside is amazing!!!! @#$%& them for their cover, and not having an ATM or a situationlike Vintage where they escort you to the bartender. They serve em up strong here though. Definitely a place to get messed up at. Especially if you are on the Molly.  Their demographic Is ghetto, wanna feel, be, try, and get ghetto. \n\nWe call this place the School of Cock. For a reason."
1,Dr. Daigle is the best Vet I've ever gone to! She's the only one I want treating my 2 dogs now.
0,"Overpriced. The overall experience was underwhelming.  I ordered the scallops entree for $24. Side salad was basic and the lettuce was near frozen.\nI had 5 1/2 scallops drowning in a heavy sauce that did not complement the scallops at all. Scallops did not seem fresh.  The twice baked potato also did not seem to be freshly prepared. \nMy daughter ordered BBQ Beef Tips off the kids' menu. They too were drowning in a heavy sauce  meant to hide & not accentuate the meat. \nOtherwise,  staff was nice, but would not recommend."
0,Very disappointed. The last time my boyfriend and I were here we had the Evo salad and the bolognese and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Tonight's dinner was different however. Not only was the kale overcooked on the salad but the homemade pasta was stiff and lacking in flavor. I have been raving about this place and the Evo salad all week but tonight was definitely a let down. We were served our entrees before we even finished our salad and ordered a bottle of wine which we intended to have with our dinner but it too came out before we had even finished our before dinner cocktails. Not sure we will be back.
0,"I have been going to Flo's for more than 10 years and have always loved the food and value. The last few visits have been disappointing. Last night we did our traditional New Year's Eve take out and were disappointed again when the sweet and sour sauce for our sweet and sour chicken was missing and the sauce for our dumplings was also missing.  I had checked the order when I picked up but forgot to check for the sauces. Needless to say, dinner was not very good. We have had problems before with take out and at this point, I can't see us doing this again. There is no quality control in Flo's take out and when I spend more than $60 for dinner, I expect to get what I pay for. Flo, if you read this, add a quality control step to your take out process."
0,"Will learn from this past order. On a Friday night, I would expect a little wait for food. But I can't believe the service. After being delivered 8 wings instead of 22, called to complain. I waited 10 minutes just to reach anyone, at which point I was asked to hold. I said no, but of course they placed me on hold anyways! I decided to get in my car and go there, and I asked to speak to the manager. The employee went to ask her to come talk to me, and she told him to \""just give her a refund\"". I would like to point out, I hadn't even complained yet! He returned and asked if I wanted a refund, as he noticed the box in my hands. I told him yes, but I still asked to speak to her. He returned to tell her, and she then instructed ANOTHER employee to \""go take care of a refund\"". The girl was really helpful, extremely apologetic, and I appreciate her help. I told her, too, that I still wanted to speak to the manager, and was told she was \""too busy\"" to come talk to me. I was there for over 30 minutes waiting on my correct food, and she still would not come talk to me. I watched as she walked around the back, occasionally stopping to make pizzas or fill another order. However, she had plenty of time to come talk to me, and didn't. \n\nIf it weren't for her rude behavior I may not even be writing this review. I understand Friday nights are busy for pizza places, and I can forgive an occasional mistake. But I was NOT satisfied with the amount of urgency placed on this mistake, and was even more appalled by the manager on duty, Marie's, lack of concern for the mistake they made. Completely unacceptable. Will be taking my pizza orders elsewhere in the future."
0,"my friends and i were distressed passengers on our way to miami and we were just looking for a place to spend the night for cheap and with shuttle service. so we picked days inn...\n\nwhat a MISTAKE!! the first room that we received was horrible!!! the sheets were super dirty, the room smelled like sh** there was hair all over them, there were no towels, and the bathroom had broken tiles and was just flat at nasty. it looked like the house keeping just made the beds (without changing the sheets) and took out the trash after the previous customers checked out. \n\n[+] we immediately asked to switched rooms, which they gladly did and they apologized. the second room was much better and was a smoking room but it didn't smell like it."
0,"Did not care about it... This place is dark, extremely dark. I understand what they are trying to do, but you can't read the menus, literally. \nFood was hit and miss, more miss than hit. Way too much dressing/seasoning masking the actual taste of what you eat. They promote \""family style\"" but quantity can not replace quality."
1,"I've been to Starborn Tattoo 4 times now to get piercings and to bring friends to get piercings.  The employees are all really nice and funny.  I could see how some people would disagree, though, because I think you need a good sense of humor to get along with everyone.\n \nThe prices of piercings are average with anywhere else I've seen and all of the ones my friends and I have received have been quality.  The place is clean and they don't mind filming or bringing multiple friends. \n \nThe one downside is the parking.  As a small female it gets a little scary parking there and walking to the building at night but usually someone will walk you out."
1,"This place prides itself for not using any deep fryers and is a trans-fat free restaurant.  I've been here a couple of times and it is actually pretty good.  I was wondering how different it would taste since they don't fry any of their food but everything was still pretty tasty.  I had the angus cheeseburger and the turkey burger another time.  They are pretty big burgers and prices aren't  too bad either, around $8 for a burger w/ fries and a drink.  The angus burger comes in either 1/4 lb or 1/2 lb (basically two 1/4 lb patties, not one huge patty) and served on a wheat bun.  The fries are \""aerobaked\"" but are pretty good, maybe just a little dry compared to fries that are deep fried.  They have different types of condiments, like garlic ketchup!  I tried it and it was good but I could still taste the garlic in my mouth after I left!  There is also different flavored syrups that you can add to your pop/soda!  Overall, not my favorite burger joint but it is good if you're looking for a \""healthy\"" burger!"
1,"Man, I needed a haircut while in Vegas.  Didn't know where to go and neither did the concierge's at my hotel.  So I did a little research on my own, and came up with A Cut Above the Rest IV Downtown Vegas.  I'm glad I did! Tim \""O\"" hooked me up! The old school music they play is great also! So I say that to say this, when in Vegas and you need a haircut and some ole' school music, check out Tim \""O\"" and crew at A Cut Above.  You'll be glad you did! Show ya right!\n\nMo Rouse, Washington, DC."
0,I will give two stars just for the sake of their smoothies and by using fresh fruits. \n\nI've been here once and tasted some of their menus. Not a fan of their food. So tedious and just an ordinary Chinese resto.
0,Very mediocre and overpriced. The breakfast potatoes are Sysco. That pretty much says it all.
0,"Disappointed overall, this place isn't how I remembered it any longer. Server was combatitive and kind of snippy, and seemed offended that we dared ask about the grilled cheese specials (that were e-mailed to one of our party, who's on their mailing list) AND that I asked about the cannoli that I remembered from a couple years ago that, at the time was so awesome that I STILL remember it to this day. Food quality was okay but not enough to overcome the bad service or justify the prices. I talked this place up pretty big to someone who'd never been there and he seemed utterly confused (and irritated) after our meal. Don't think I'll be going back. Sad that my fond memories of this place are now just a thing of the past."
0,"Went for happy hour, sat in the bar, it took forever! Service was so so. He was very flamboyant, but not expedient. It may have been the kitchen slowing him? The place NEEDED DUSTING BADLY! \nCalimari was so limp. Pizza doughy. Zucchini excellent!"
0,"It's under construction so there are lots of areas that are closed off or have plastic sheets blocking you off - occasional loud noise just from that. The line for checkin is really long, but it moves. The rooms are okay at best - we didn't even get a \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign, though. Oh, and by far the most confusing walk from the parking garage depending on where you end up. Yes, more so than at other casinos.\n\nThe casino is on the smaller side, but it's okay."
1,Best tea shop ever. Definitely need to stop by and try one. Wide selection. Each one has a unique flavor. Different varieties!!! A must!
1,"I booked Paris because I received comp room and I couldn't resist, so I booked it right away. The entrance is always full of people crossing but so is Bellagio and Mirage, the valet area was taking forever to park my car but that was no biggie. Checking in took  20 minutes but the front desk woman was very friendly checking me in and told me the pool was open 24 / 7 but I should be cautious because of no lifeguards being on duty. That was a plus for the pool being open 24 / 7 but the weather was too cold to go night swimming. \n\nCasino wasn't as stuffy and was pretty clean to me. My room was very clean and updated with the flat screen TV and the mini fridge was a huge plus, so no need to bring coolers to Paris unless you have lots of food and drink to bring. It beats going back and forth for ice. The room was clean and has a French contemporary design and is not to shabby for a basic comp room and your hardly in your room unless you're here for work and no play.  :o\n\nI request a non smoking king bed with a strip view but they they only had 2 queen so I opted for that. I do like looking at the view from my room to relax and enjoy the scenery but it was nice to get what I requested despite checking in late. \n\nI would come back and stay here again if it was comp and a deep discount. Even though they don't have wifi, the internet on my smart phone still works so yay for me. \n\n=)"
0,"So my party and I went to Liquid on the first Tuesday they were open this season. First off the security at the Aria didn't even know the day club was open. The staff at Liquid seemed nice but there was a total of 8 guests excluding my party at the club. They have plenty of lounge areas amd cabanas for a busy day, but having to spend 65 dollars for a pitcher to reserve a lounge area around a unexpectedly small pool didn't exactly seem worth wild. Maybe on a weekend in peak season it would be a cool day club, but it just wasn't for us when we went so we left after 10 minutes."
1,"Stayed here for two nights, rooms are huge and well provisioned with plasmas, dark materials and amazing bedding.  The hotel itself is beautiful, as to be expected with any Vegas big time hotel.  Room service was attentive and quick, the help was fantastic overall.  Their lobby bar is pretty fun as well and their restaurant up on the 68th floor is really good, food rocks but oye vey the help needs...well help."
0,"Whenever I've taken a trip down Leith Walk, I always feel on edge. There has never been a time that I've walked down hassle free or without someone asking me for spare change. Just the other week I was stopped no less than 3 times before I was a quarter of the way down and one of the men asking me for money got rather aggressive when I said no and followed me for a few metres until someone else came along. Leith Walk reminds me of Victoria Street in Glasgow, somewhere that I'd never walk along on my own.\n\nNo matter what time of day you find yourself here, there's always an abundance of drunken men spilling out of the bookies and pubs than line the street.\n\nThere is a good mix and selection of shops and many independent stores too which is refreshing but the seedy undertone to Leith Walk puts me of going anywhere near it and although you'd probably never come to any harm here, I'd still recommend walking here with a friend, especially at night!"
0,"When I went to see Brandon Flowers here (my one and only, hopefully last visit to this HOB) the staff was horrible.  I know this will sound silly and like I'm exaggerating, but I truly felt like none of them had ever organized/worked a concert before.  It was absolute chaos.  I go to concerts all the time and this was by far the worst experience I've had with a venue and their ability to fairly and effectively manage the crowd.  Lots of people were waiting all day long before the show started and hours later, closer to showtime, the whole line was moved around about 8 or 9 times.  One guy would tell us we were all in the wrong place and needed to line up by the escalators, then someone else would lead us to a different spot in the casino, then back in front of the venue again, and it went on and on and on.  This whole time the line was getting messed up and people were running around like crazy trying to make sure they didn't get screwed out of their spot.  Once they finally decided where to put us, half the people were facing in one direction and half in the other direction.  The staff couldn't even decide where the front of the line was!  It was so ridiculous none of us could believe it.  \n\nThey continued to be completely unorganized and when we were finally let into the venue, they destroyed the line again by holding back the right side & letting tons of people from the left go in...and then did the same to the other side.  Do these people not understand the point of lining up??  It's not just for fun, it's because we all spent many hours trying to ensure a great spot.  Telling us \""every spot is a good spot\"" is irrelevant and makes it clear that you don't understand at ALL.  \n\nOh I forgot to mention the best part.  To even get into this line that would be let in first, they force you to spend $20 in their store or restaurant to get a pass in.  So if you're a huge fan of whoever is playing, just know that the 'Pass The Line' people will be let in before you unless you shell out an additional $20.  Way to pray on the fans, make a quick buck, and then treat us like crap, HOB.  Not amused at all.\n\nI hope Brandon never plays here again, because he's the only musician I'd go through this for again.  I almost gave them 2 stars because the bartender was nice when I asked for water, but they really don't deserve it."
0,"Not much to analyze....this is more Sysco slop straight off the truck.  Minimal prep required with minimal generic taste to match.  Salads drowned in dressing with the dressing full of enough MSG to swell your ankles up for a week.\n\nDazzling array of beers tempered by the knowledge that half of them aren't very good.  Must echo the review on this page noting that checking IDs of people obviously well beyond age 21 insults the intelligence of all concerned and tends to sour the relationship with the bartender from the word go.  Smug buttons with 'We ID everybody' don't compensate for legal overkill, intellectual laziness and a lack of common sense.\n\nToo many of today's parents of young children believe that any place serving food is fair game for the little darlings even if the establishment in question is primarily a bar.  One mother, who apparently was an employee but off-duty, brought the little heathen 'Crawford' (groan) over to sit him on the bartop where he grabbed straws and napkins out of the caddy and hurled them in random directions.  Of course, mom thought this was adorable - adults trying to enjoy an adult beverage somewhat less so.\n\nI don't smoke but perhaps a rethink of smoking bans is warranted if it prevents every establishment from becoming a branch of Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nit's a shame that local places have fallen prey to the same assembly line mentality as their corporate competition.  Duckworth's tastes like Chili's tastes like Applebee's tastes like Friday's.   Given that all are buying the same raw materials from the same vendor this shouldn't be a surprise but it is nevertheless discouraging trying to find a place where they actually use recipes rather than reading directions on the side of a box.  The quest continues."
1,"Panera Bread, although a tad overpriced in my opinion, is a decent place to a grab a quick bite to eat. I am not going to say they are a healthy option compared to other \""fast\"" type eateries because I don't think everything on their menu is really promoting great health. However, it is a step up from a burger and fries combo at McDonald's. \n\nThis Panera is a staple of The District, sits directly facing the parking lot and is conveniently located. The establishment is large and spacious, which is good, because anytime I have been here the place has been steady with patrons. Customer service is good, although I always get hit up to get their card, which I decline, because I don't go to Panera enough to warrant getting the card. Plus, all in all I am kind of fed up with this every freakin' place I go wants to give me some card deal. Hrumph. Anyway.\n\nFood - I ordered the Chipotle Panini and my husband ordered the Smokehouse Trukey Panini. Both came out deliciously melty and warm, pressed perfectly. I received mine with chips, my husband got a cut up apple, so we shared. Overall loved the paninis. We also ordered a yummy blueberry muffin which was dense and flavorful. \n\nQuality vs. price - Again, as stated above I feel Panera to be overpriced. I got two combo paninis (which do not come with a drink), one small drink, and a muffin, my total came to almost 20 bucks. The paninis are on the smaller side, so the price value does not exactly match the quality and quantity of what you are receiving. However, the taste is good.\n\nSo you have to fight your battles with fast, convenient, \""healthier\"" food. Of course I will return to Panera Bread in the future. I just wish it did not hurt my wallet so bad."
1,"When I take clients or family out, I take them to Dandelion Market.  The goat cheese salad is incredible and the rack of lollipop lamb is spectacular - always cooked to perfection.  The staff are friendly, attentive, courteous and go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. I have eaten at Dandelion at least twenty times and have had a great experience every time. Friends from Mexico are coming to visit for Easter so I look forward to taking them there. In the meantime I'll be stopping in over St. Patrick's Day weekend for sure."
1,"Tried this place tonight for takeout and thought the quality was very good. We had difficulty viewing the menu online so just described to the woman over the phone what we wanted. We ordered pineapple curry with chicken, stir fried glass noodles with shrimp and saut\u00e9ed spicy eggplant with steamed tofu, I'm not sure the proper names for these dishes. The price was good, about what we pay on average for Thai around Phoenix. When my husband called in the order, he at first didn't specify the level of spice, so he called back and specified medium. I swear they must have thought we wanted double spice since we called back because our food was spicy! I love spicy food, usually eat Serrano peppers with most savory meals and the food was borderline uncomfortable for me to eat.  My husband ended up mixing a lot of rice with small amounts of each entree so he could tolerate it.  I'm thinking they made a mistake.  Anyway, it was still delicious and we will order from here again, but we'll play around with the spice level to suit our tastes."
1,"Meal was very good, I had the filet of sole, waitress was attentive, however did not clear plates when I was finished. Service is almost always an issue when dining @ Mimi's. see the other reviews for Casa Grande."
0,"I ordered chicken fingers, bacon cheese fries & a oreo cookie shake. The delivery took 1 hr & 45 minutes. The food was cold & the fingers were over cooked. The shake was described as a custard ice cream shake but it tasted like crushed ice-milk with that consistency too. If thats a  custard milkshake, which I have eaten, then im a blonde lol...\nOn the plus side was that they put a lot of bacon on the bacon cheese fries. But, thats about it. Needless to say, im never ordering from this place again."
0,"I have frequented urban picnic in the past, and have absolutely loved every one of their sandwiches. My favorite was the mushroom sandwich they offered. It was mushroomy creamy goodness.\n\nI was disappointed to learn today that not only has urban picnic changed management, but they have also changed their menu and the amazingness that was the mushroom sandwich is no where to be found. I was also disappointed to see they have changed from their paper takeout boxes to styrofoam. They used to be more earth conscious. :( It's not like they couldn't afford the little bit of higher coat for paper given the menu pricing...\n\nI reverted to one of my other favorites, the curry chicken sandwich. The filling was still delightful; however, what was not delightful was finding that it had not been cut in half and was quite unmanageable as a whole sandwich. Hacking through the sandwich with the flimsy plastic knife provided was a messy nightmare and ended in a broken knife, and an only partially cut sandwich. I am hoping this was just a mistake made by whoever was in the kitchen today, but it only added to my disappointment. The croissant was also quite stale, which explains why it was so difficult to cut through. This could easily be remedied by freezing the croissants you aren't going to use and pulling them out as needed at the beginning of each day.\n\nWhat was a great relief to me was finding they had kept the lavender lemonade! If you have never tried their lemonade, I highly recommend it. It is to die for.\n\nIf anyone knows the new owners at Urban Picnic, please I beg you to urge them to bring back the mushrooms."
0,Ya know .. I don't get it .. seems like a small step up from an IHOP or Denny's .. maybe it's just me.
0,"Ok, so I know I shouldn't expect much from hotel restaurants.  I'll try to make it quick and painless.\n\nThe good:  the grilled flat bread with the citrus garlic hummus like paste that they give you instead of bread.  Considering it's a resort hotel cafe, the price wasn't ridiculous.  \n\nThe bad:  Slow service.  I was there when it was DEAD, and the service was nonetheless slow, especially on the coffee refills.  I ordered the ahi nicoise salad.  After checking to confirm that it wasn't tuna from a can, I got this dry, marinated tuna steak (about 3/8\"" thickness) on top of what was an egg, tomato and kalamata topped caesar salad.  The tuna was about the salties thing I ever tasted.  It was like eating a tuna steak version of salted anchovies.  Brutal.  \n\nLesson:  Don't eat the nicoise salad.  Go for something that they really can't screw up, like a grilled chicken sandwich and fries."
0,"Why would I lie about being told to bring cash?  I was never told about a broken machine.  Ask your empolyees again if I was told to bring $300 to $500 dollars in cash and whether you ever explained to me about a broken machine but rather just to bring cash.  Now I was obviously drugged and mumbled from the time I walked in the shop  so no one could understand me? That is blatantly slanderous. Rarely are heavily drugged people called rude so many times because they are not capable of being coherent enough to be rude.Such a poor attempt at your own defense.  Say what you will but you know you have lied. I noticed all of your positive reviews are quite old. \"" I refuse to write incorrect things about people who lie in the middle of the day.\""  All I wanted was a rose.I was disappointed that I could not talk to the person ahead of time who you planned to do the tattoo. As I gave you a very detailed description of course I was disapppointed that I was explaining all of this to someone who knew he was not going to do the tattoo.I came in a day before I wanted the tattoo done as I politely explained on the phone so that it could be drawn on that day and inked on the next day.  If no one was going to be available,it would have been a courtesy to tell me that.    Fortunately there are many honest artists in town who won't call me rude, tell me I am on drugs, tell me they only take cash without an explanation,tell me to find an ATM to get $20 to hold an appointment, tell me they have never heard of a debit card when they obviously have, and then say I am on drugs.  I remember too many things too clearly to have been drugged. I was disappointed by you not your employees and to them I apologize for this ugliness.  You were unclear as to who you were among your employees and I only assumed you were the owner as you had the largest working space in the rear of the shop.  Please ask your apprentice who could not keep up with the appointment book just how drugged I seemed as in your empty shop no one else could hear us.I apologize to the Las Vegas High School coaches who said you were a good guy and I should try going to you as you said you don't know any of them and had never heard of the school.  They are very loyal gentleman and were hurt when they were told this as well as horrified to know they sent me to a person who called me rude and stated I was drugged the entire time in his shop.  I doubt you need to worry about seeing them again but as you don't know them, it doesn't matter."

1,"So went back the very next night, this time accompanied by my boyfriend. For a quick bite after work at 10pm.\n\n Eating at Meat and Potatoes was like a dream the first time. I had to go back a  second time to make sure it was real and that I hadn't only dreamed it and now we have reservations for dinner on Saturday. They read me the specials!!! It's just the little things. \n\nHe loved it! As I knew he would.  He commented on the music and even sang along to some of the songs. They were playing music that was just his style a lot of old school, R and B. As if some one  at the restaurant had plugged his iphone to speakers lol. \n\n I am a creature of habit , I got the fried  pickles again and the sweetbread tacos again, he ordered a pub burger.  The burger was a bit charred on the outside, but was topped with smoky pork belly pastrami and a fried egg. He said the yolk from the egg made a nice sauce on the burger. \n\nMy complaints.  The hostess took a little longer than I thought was necessary to find us a table even though half the tables were empty. There was less meat in my sweetbread tacos tonight then there was the previous night and the table was so tiny it made me nervous that something would go crashing to the floor. Also the drafts were written in white marker on a mirror that was 15 feet away from our table.  But I suppose I could have just asked the waitress.\n\nMeat and Potatoes is so dim it's hard to read the menu.\n\n I am enchanted by Meat and Potatoes."
0,"The woman behind the counter was quite pleasant, and the service is generally quite nice as a whole, but I, for one, find their lack of organization disheartening.\nThe cash register was out of pennies, and the woman working the till had no records but to round down when giving change, lest she chime up short at the end of her shift. The rest of the pennies were ostensibly stowed safely in the time-lock safe, which is only a minute oversight, but far from the only one.\nFountain drinks are eighty-none cents for a small. I thought it wise to mention that here, because that information is curiously absent from the store itself. In fact, all the prices are missing from the soda fountain. And the cold sandwiches. And the burritos. And the string cheese. In fact, the hot dog roller was the only thing in the wee deli area that said anything useful. \nThere were many places where it looked like price tags had been affixed and later removed, which was only more disconcerting. I can see the wisdom in removing or amending indirect information, but not in wholly dissociating their displays from posted valuation.\nI thought of buying a sandwich or burrito, but decided not to because I shouldn't have to price check things just to know whether I should have cash or my card ready at the checkout counter WHERE THEY WOULD CHECK THE PRICE. I opted for a Little Debbie snack, because the price is already printed on the package when it arrives at the store."

0,"Very disappointed! My fianc\u00e9 and I went to see the Suns play the Spurs and while we were satisfied with our seats and the game, the venue was terrible. There were hardly any concessions to choose from for food and drinks. We decided to get a hot dog that turned out to be the smallest hot dog I've ever seen. For $6 I couldn't believe it. We went to the condiment station to find no spoons or serving utensils for the onions or relish and the ketchup dispenser was broken. On top of only being able to put mustard on our hot dogs, it was a mess. We went to our seats to find there were no cup holders which made it difficult when people were walking in and out of the rows. \nI have to say that besides the friendly employees and decent parking this venue was a huge disappointment."
0,"Waited 14 minutes after being seated for our order to be taken. Not a good start. Food arrived 22 minutes in. The shrimp spring rolls were not good, tasted old (we arrived at 10:30am, possibly made the prior day). The pho is salty, but that seems to be the trend, but it was not bad."
1,"I stay here every time I come to Vegas and I LOVE IT! The rooms are spacious and clean, beds are super comfortable, service is outstanding! They have a shuttle that goes to the strip every day til midnight (watch your time, midnight will come faster than you know it when you're having fun on the Strip!).  I would give it the full five stars if they had a shuttle to the airport."

1,"I have been using this club since it opened.  I swim and use the locker room.  My only complaint is that they do not know how to clean the tile floors.  I see the cleaning person with a string mop, which is basically just spreading dirty water over the floor.  The floors are in need of professional steam cleaning."
0,"To me, Pinkberry doesn't live up to all the hype.  You end up paying about 6 or 7 bucks for a small cup of yogurt with whatever toppings you want on it.  I sampled the regular, coconut, and melon flavors before settling with the melon.  I personally thought all three flavors were just 'meh', but the coconut was by far the worst.  For toppings I got some chocolate balls, brownie bites, and pumpkin granola (they do have a wide variety of fruits, nuts, chocolates, and cereals as well).  The toppings were definitely the best thing out of the whole experience.  The service was pretty decent, one of the two workers seemed to really enjoy her job, and I was lucky enough to have her wait on me.  Overall, I expected much more from all the west coast Pinkberry hype."
0,"This is a follow up to my previous review of this shop back in January 2011.  This past weekend the water pump in my Outlander went out.  This is the same water pump that was replaced at the time that Dave replaced my timing belt (the one that broke 13,000 miles after he replaced it...).  So now, about 20,000 miles and one year later the water pump also has to be replace AGAIN.  As does the timing belt, the third time I have replaced it in the last year, thanks to contamination resulting from the water pump going out.  \n\nThe mechanic that fixed the water pump was kind enough to bring it out to me and showed me that it had been sealed with an excess amount of silicone rather than being installed properly with a good fit.  Needless to say, I still do not recommend the"
0,"Ummm...well....they have parrots in the lobby....I guess thats a good thing.\n\nI would never stay here. A few of my friends are staying here and I went to visit them. Everything about the hotel needs a complete update. The rooms are old and smelly. The paint in the shower was peeling. The tv did not really work good. I think I could feel the springs in the mattress.\n\nIt is right across the street from Gammage auditorium .... so if you are visiting ASU I guess it has a pretty good location. But thats about it.\n\nOh yeah, there is an IHOP attached to the hotel,....so if you get fed up of your crappy hotel room you could always go downstairs and get some mediocre pancakes. \n\nI would give it just 1 star...but they allow dogs so I will give them 2 just because it always sucks trying to find a place to travel when you have your pooch."
1,"Went into town christmas shopping and decided to pop down hanover street to see if we could find any good deals for lunch. La lanterna had a 3 course lunch meal for a very good price.\n\nWe had doughballs for a started and pizza and pasta for our mains. We halved each to try both options. The pepperoni on the pizza was underneath the cheese, so it was cooked but not burnt, never thought of cooking it this way before but it made a big difference.\n\nThe staff were very attentive and it was a lovely little quiet restaurant. Would thoroughly recommend if you're in town looking for a good meal. Only reason they have gotten 4 stars is because they only had tiramasu or coffee for the dessert option, and I don't like coffee so I was a bit stuck!"
1,"We came here for a \""snack\"", as my ever hungry friend called it, as we were here shopping.\nOur \""snack\"" consisted of a Spicy Chicken & 3 Cheese Pizza, Yummy Baja Style Fish Tacos, Black & Tan Beer Battered Onion Rings, shakes, a coffee, and an OMG Chocolate Chunk Cookie. I think we ordered more food but I was entering a food coma already so I sort of forgot, I just know the bill came out a little under $100.\nI'd compare the food here to a really good version of Friday's, good but nothing amazing.\nThe portions were pretty decent, big enough that most normal people would call it a meal."
1,"When people ask me how was EDC? incredible is the only word I can come up with, and even that barely says anything. \n\nA it's a whole other landscape of reality that embraces all styles of the Electronic Dance Music world and the headliners who love it. For me it was home. \n\nGetting here, I understand, that the smart money is taking a shuttle pass. But in my case we decided to drive to the location and of course made rookie mistake of taking the freeway just like everyone else. The trick is to just take Las Vegas blvd all the way down, it'll be an easy 30 minute ride from the strip. \n\nThe parking itself wasn't terrible, just expect a bit of a walk afterwards. And getting into the even was simple as long as you don't use Entrance Gate A, that's where everyone and the shuttle riders get dropped off. \n\nThe rumors circulating that Insomniac dropped 35 million on  this event where undeniable. All the stages, performers, pyrotechnics,  and art displays where incredible sites to behold. I even got to meet Nigel Ficke (I really hope that picture never pops  up ahaha)! Ground Control, the volunteer assist group, always brought the energy and free waters to those in need. \n\nI was rather sad to read some earlier reviews from Yelpers that had run -ins with people that brought the bad vibes, but from my experience I saw nothing of the sort. Everyone was all high fives and hugs that actively made efforts to make one feel at home, it was unlike an other.  \n\nAll the artists where phenomenal, and with such a vast array spanning across many stages I was able to catch my favorites while discovering new ones (Circuit Grounds, Cosmic Meadow, and Basspod stole the show)! \n\nI left this place believing that it's true haven and the ultimate pilgrimage for any EDM fan (alongside Tomorrowland). One of the only bones I have to pick is that certain artists decided to reside at the clubs that come out the Speedway that! Till next year!"
0,"My wife and I went there for lunch about 2:30pm today, 10/28/14. \n\nThe service was slow, the iced tea was so weak it looked like water for 2.50 a glass. My food was cold and looked like it had been sitting for hours. I can understand that this was an off hour, but I expect good quality food and service all the time.\n\nWhat a disappointment!!"

0,"Items in the Office Depot / Office Max ad that show trade in on old printer. This is for select models of purchase. However, none of those models for purchase are in stock. Bait and switch to be sure. In fact, one of the models has never been carried at the store. The other has been sold out for quite some time. In order to take advantage of this deal you need to drive 30 minutes in any direction to a different store."
1,"I've been to this location a few times as this is my \""go-to-spot\"" while waiting to meet people from Craigslist to buy or sell something from people around Tempe.  \n\nI love the way they slice all the ingredients, the meats and the cheese right on the spot according to the sandwich you order.  \n\nThey also hot sandwiches here and they don't nuke them in microwaves like they do at subway.  They have a grill!\n\nJersey Mike's is no-brainer over Subway any day!"
1,"I have been a client of Rodney's for six months. I decided to have a consultation with him after reading an article in which his knowledge and passion for hair (specifically color) were evident. I have been platinum blonde for years and decided that I wanted to make the investment in changing my overly processed blonde hair into a softer more natural look. In just the last six months that I have been a client of his, my hair is healthier with less breakage and is a color that I love. The combination of his extensive knowledge of color and his consideration for his clients quality of hair make him a stylist that I have and would recommend to my friends and family. Rodney is located in Sachi salon in a space that is clean, attractively furnished, and is stocked with quality products that he uses on his clients and are available for purchase. His assistant Jessica is not only efficient and friendly, but is also a skilled stylist who I believe just happens to be learning from one of the best! I highly recommend Rodney Gentry for both color and cut."
0,"Stay away from Rancho Cockroachietta, My wife and lived here for a yr, and made repeated request for building to be fumigated because of cockroach problems, and bed bugs. Only to told by management that complex doesn't have a roach problem. WRONG WRONG WRONG, My wife is bitten nightly by bed bugs, and I have woken up with cockroaches crawling across my arm. Their own pest control person even admits that is a problem, but still they won't do anything about it. Now because of this problem we are being evicted because of it, and have to throw out a California King bed that cost 1500 because of the bedbugs.\n\nAlso the first night we were there, someone asshole vandalized my wife's brand new car, and when I reported to the management, all they could say is we aren't responsible for damaged property. I can guarantee that if there property was damaged those losers would going after the person who did it."
1,I contacted my Allstate Insurance company to replace a windshield and was provided the number to Safelite Solutions (a.k.a. Safelite AutoGlass).\n\nThe service was great. To make the appointment was easy. The guy was on time and finished within the time frame that he stated. He was meticulous about making sure everything was just right. He was polite and considerate.\n\nThe product was everything that I expected and the service was top notch.
1,"Definitely a bucket list kinda thang!!! \n\nBF and I wanted to do something different and something we've both never done before.... I saw this deal on Amazon Local and figured that's COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from all the hype that is Las Vegas. \n\nAlthough we started way early for my liking, it was a pretty dope experience! \nFrom watching them inflate a hot air ballon that came outta a family van, to being 1300 feet above ground, to watching them deflate the hot air.... It was something we'll both never forget! \n\n\nPlease take note: I'm scared of heights and didn't look down once. But, it was amazing. And didn't even feel shaky at all. Felt like we were on solid ground."
0,"I really love the concept of Eteaket but unfortunately its execution is not up to par. I have visited Eteaket twice. I vowed never to return after my first experience but had a change of heart when a friend and I were looking for a cafe near by. \n\nI came with my boyfriend the first time I visited. As we walked in I giggled at my boyfriend's choice as it's definitely a ladies place. It's cute. I think that's the best way to describe the decor. All pink and turquoise. We ordered tea, scones and half a sandwich each.  It took over 45 minutes to receive our tea - just the tea!! I don't even know why we stayed!! I think it was a combination of being in the middle of town on a Saturday and everywhere else being full. Still 45 minute for tea is cray cray. \n\nThe good: the tea is delicious and I love the choices that are available. It's the largest selection of tea that I have seen in Edinburgh. \n\nThe bad: Meh. Eteaket isn't really bad, per se. I hope that I've just had a really bad experience. I'll say that in my opinion the scones are nothing to rave about it. \n\nThe ugly: The service needs improvement. \n\nI'm not rushing back."
0,"This was the worst \""Japanese\"" food my husband and I have ever had. We ordered 5 maki rolls. The pieces were so small they could not be considered pieces of maki. Two of the rolls supposedly had fish, but most of the pieces of maki had no recognizable fish inside. The rolls were so poorly made that they fell apart when we picked them up with the chopsticks. The taste was terrible. The wasabi wasn't real. It had the consistency of diarrhea and was dyed green. We felt sad after the meal, and cheated out of $45. First and last time ever eating here."
0,We went here to grab a burger and a beer.... Service was non existent and when the bartender did greet us she acted as if she was doing us a favor.    We went about 9:30pm this passed friday.

1,"I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews about AZ wine company.  I had the special occasion to stop in here prior to having dinner next door at Atlas Bistro.  \n\nI found that their staff was extremely helpful on more than one occasion in which I wanted to select a bottle of wine.\n\nI appreciate the wide selections of wine and the knowledgeable staff, buy what appealed to me the most was the fact that they have several bottles of wine that are highly rated for under $30.  I was a little surprised by that actually.  Of course there are wines in there for new and mid-level collectors.  I'm not sure if this is the place for serious wine collectors.  \n\nOne thing is for sure, I have used AZ wine many times when I wanted to stop in and pick up a quick bottle of wine.  I took 3 bottles of wine to the International Supper Club UYE and everyone that had wine said they really enjoyed it.  I have NEVER been disappointed with the recommendations.  I highly suggest this store for the wine lovers who love local businesses!"
0,Typical CPK.\n\nI'm surprised that none of the CPKs offer any sort of gluten-free option for the pizza. Never my choice to go here.
1,"Come really, really hungry.\n\nThat's the best advice I can give to anyone that wants to visit Hash House a Go Go.  You will have more food on your plate than you can comprehend in a glance.  Galaxies have been known to be smaller.  The gravitational pull of the chicken and waffles may trap you in its orbit, forcing you to consume the chicken just to have a chance to escape intact... not that you'll mind doing so.\n\nWe've been to HHaGG multiple times for both breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and have never run into a meal we didn't like.  Their reliance on potatoes as a filler sometimes borders on the crazy however.  I'm tempted to ask for my next meal without any potatoes, if it's listed as an ingredient.\n\nThe meals we've experienced are the stuffed burgers, fried green tomatoes, chicken and waffles (with strips of bacon through the waffles), the chicken pot pie, the home-made corn beef hash, and some of the specials.  The chicken soup was also very flavorful.\n\nI can't think of anything I'd improve on when it comes to the food.  Just remember that your eyes are larger than your stomach.  No one's going to think less of you if you suggest splitting an entree here!"
0,"Eh. Lackluster and overpriced food.  Their wings are pretty wimpy. The service is either just ok or really bad. Their mixed drinks on special feature cheap well liquor. I'm not asking for Grey Goose, but the vodka tasted like it came from a plastic bottle. I'm a big house salad eater, and theirs are only served with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes on top. How bout some onions and croutons?!  But seriously,  the food isn't what it used to be at other locations ~10 years ago or so. We don't come in anymore because it's always an expensive way to just leave disappointed."
1,"I stayed at the MGM back in September with a few of my girlfriends. After a full morning out by the pool, slightly tipsy from a few drinks, we were ready for lunch.... a cheap-ish lunch by Las Vegas standards. So a friend and I gathered the $$ and went on the hunt for some food.\n\nThis place caught our eye, as did the wonderful smell coming from inside. The line was pretty quick, there are a tone of different and unique sandwich choices, and wow it was one of the best sandwiches I've had. Needless to say we ate lunch here the next two days.\n\nMy personal fave. is the Panini with chicken breast, roasted red pepper, mozzarella and pesto on country bread....yummy!"
1,"Sin City Wings really is a one-of-a kind wing experience. I've never experienced food that's as hot, yet bursting with flavor. I was also unfamiliar with the concept of a \""naked\"" wing, meaning there isn't any breading - absolutely delicious. \n\nBeing from out of town, I also got to learn more about some of Vegas' locals. The wings are named after several iconic figures, including the Oscar Goodman, which was my favorite wing and extremely hot, yet flavorful. I also have to mention the pot stickers because they are awesome and rolled in the same spicy sauce as the wings.\n\nIf you're cruising around the strip and happen to see the yellow wing truck, I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"
1,"I travel a ton and get to experience some of the best food in the world. Second time attending here and this time I took my Dad. Out of all the restaurants I took him to in Arizona, and I took him to lots, he agreed with me that they were the best. Chicken with the mac n cheese is amazing, great service and underrated among the food blogs and awards out there. See you when I'm back in town!"
1,"Great food, great service and never left hungry from the dinner portion. I strongly recommend giving it a shot."
0,Stains in the carpets. Fixtures falling off the wall and a big green line through the Freaken TV overall this place is a ratchet shithole. No wonder Paris Hilton sold this piece  of shit hotel before everything fell apart on her.

0,"I'm not sure why this place has such stellar Yelp ratings. I assume these reviews were crafted by those who aren't foodies.\n\nThe food here is not good PERIOD. \nI ordered the mussels Moules Hamburg and the mussels Portuguese Style. They were both disgusting. First of all they use previously frozen mussels on the half shell so they don't exactly source the freshest ingredients. The mussels were tough and over cooked. I was picturing a light broth that was just enough to dip you bread in while you could still taste the ocean and the flavor of the mussels. This is not what I got. I got mussels that were drowning in broth. I literally had to go fishing for my mussels since they were completely submerged in broth. The Hamburg style had no mushrooms as the waiter stated and the Portuguese style had no chorizo. The Portuguese style was nearly inedible as there was some off putting bitter aftertaste to the broth. \nI also ordered the stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto. These were sad and not good. The mushrooms were no joke the size of a nickel and stuffed with pesto rice. Then they were wrapped in prosciutto and broiled. This was an epic fail as the prosciutto was dry over cooked and burnt. \n\nService here was also a disappointment. The \""dining room\"" was very small with about 6 tables that face an open galley style kitchen. The kitchen is tiny, unkept, and in my mind better left unseen. It's not like Thomas Keller is manning the stoves. \n\nMy waiter wasn't the best in the business either.  He didn't know the specials of the day, he never refilled my water and he even brought me the wrong check.\n\nIn summary, don't eat here. Take you hard earned cash elsewhere."
0,"I am very disappointed on the customer service in general. I had a seasonal business and I made an agreement with them before I gave them my business that they have to put me inactive for a good number of months and will let them know to activate me again. I called to put my account inactive immediately after the season was over. came to find out they were still pulling money from my bank. called again and I was assured they will process my request and refund the money. saw them again pull the money from my bank draft next month. I spoke to the so called supervisor and promised me on the stack of bible to correct the problem and refund me the mounting unnecessary charges. to my dismay after 4 months, I saw my statement got charged again. I was so fed up, and decided to go to my bank instead, paid a fee to initiate a stop payment. I felt that I rather pay a fee one time than have to deal with this ***. by the way, I am writing this not to smear anyone's reputation but to make you aware that a good company can become bad because of the customer service you hire. I know im sure for many you are satisfied. Apparently my experience with them was horrible. by the way, I gave prolific the benefit of the doubt bec they did the same to me last year. now they've done it again. So what does that tell me?"
1,"I first visited the Cake Cafe when I was looking for a cake topper. No other place would sell me a topper without the cake! I was getting married out of state, so ordering the cake would not work. The owner was wonderful. She showed me her book and offered to order one for me with no mark up! Since then, we have come back nearly every weekend. This is a much better value, and flavor than Sprinkles! I will continue to be a loyal customer. I have never been disappointed and am confident I never will be! I have tried almost every flavor, ordered for work, as well as order cakes and a pie! My son loves the Macaroons!"
1,"As a beer connoisseur, there is no other liquor store in town for me.  I may make the occasional visit to Aces or Total or Lee's or Whole Foods, but Khoury's is the hippest beer place in town.  This is the only place where you can sit down at a bar and enjoy a craft beer, either one from the tap or one from the fridge, and NOT have to listen to slot machines or blaring music.  That's right folks, this is a unique place.  This is a place with an intimate setting and fine beverages, and sometimes you don't even feel like you are in Vegas. I know, I know, it is blasphemous to the Vegas \""scene\"" to be without slot machines or loud music, but it is the best scene in Vegas.  \n\nI've been coming to Khoury's for the past few months on most Wednesday nights when they have beer tastings.  I've purchased sour beers from Khoury's from breweries such as 3 Fonteinen and Contillon.  I've had Dogfish Head 120, Deschutes Black Butte XIII, barrel aged Black Hole from Mikkeller, funky Joly Pumpkin Farmhouse Ales, Maui IPA's.  The list goes on.  I've tasted many beers that just aren't available in Vegas, from Russian River sours to Great Divide barley wines.  This place, my Yelping friends, is the mecha for beer, the best beer in town.\n\nKhoury's also features great wines.  There is a wine tasting every Thursday night.  On both Wednesdays and Thursdays food trucks accompany the tastings.  The best thing about this place is the knowledge that the owner has for his product.  Issa, a native to Nevada, has such a vast experience with wine, beer, and liquors, and offers expert advice and opinions on the products he carries.  Issa is the little guy in town that fights for distribution among the big boys for the finest beverages that come to this city, and he usually wins because he knows his stuff.\n\nFolks, if you take beer or wine seriously, Khoury's is worth the drive no matter what part of the valley you live in.  I drive weekly all the way from the west side of town to partake in this rare oddity of subculture and escape from the generic Vegas scene.  Khoury's offers this town something that it has never seen, and I want more Vegas residents to have a chance to appreciate it!"
1,"By far this is the best hotel for the money I've been to in Las Vegas. Since my wife and I discovered it last year on our mini-moon I haven't stayed anywhere else on my trips to the city that never sleeps.  I highly recommend getting a premium view room on an upper floor.  The view of the Bellagio fountain is amazing and a completely different experience than watching it from the strip. The rooms have always been clean with all of the cool electronic room controls that guys like me LOVE!  I prefer the 1 bedroom but have stayed in the standard room and both have been comfortable and VERY modern feeling!\n   Another nice thing about this property is the diversity of things to do.  Between all of the restaurants, shops, Marquee and all the pools on the property there was never a lack of things to do.  Speaking of the pool, you HAVE to try out the Neapolitan at the main pool for some booze infused ice cream.  \n  The spa is a little pricey but it is very clean and has plenty of work out machines to use.  A little suggestion, I used the main gym in the West (?) Tower and had a $20 per day fee...A different time, I used the smaller gym in the East tower with no charge.  Not saying it will work for you, but it's worth a try.  \n  A final note...if you drive you are going to LOVE the parking garage.  Each level tells you how many open spaces there are AND there are lights that indicate where the open spaces are.  Totally eliminates the hassle of space hunting in the parking garage."
1,Service was excellent. Owner even stopped by to check on our table. Food was amazing. This is our new breakfast spot.
0,"Nice people,  nice view.  Except the guy who hung up on me this morning when I called about the internet not working. At first I thought it was just the internet that was my main issue with this place because I couldn't get any work done and they don't have anyone to fix it during late and early morning hours - but the parking garage is really sketchy, the office chair that I sat on when I arrived fell over, which they did replace. The temperature control was nonexistent it was blazing hot or freezing cold. With the shower on the hottest setting it was barely warm. The bathroom fan was not able to be turned off when the light was on and was super loud. If it wasn't for the view and some of the nice staff I would give it a 1. Checking out and heading to an air B&B"
1,A great place to go see some pretty cool animals!! Make sure to feed the lorrys during their feeding times. Its pretty cool. The Dragon World exhibit is really cool too. Tickets are pretty expensive. $16 for just the zoo and $31 for the zoo and aquarium.
1,"My dog is 86 pounds of pure chicken. She's a rescue who is still very nervous around strangers (and vacuums, doorbells, and wood flooring), and her size can make her a real monster when she's scared. Yet she still needs annual checkups and booster shots, and Lookout Mountain is the lucky winner. The front desk was very cooperative at shuffling her right into the exam room when we arrived so that she wouldn't have to sit in the waiting room (with all those scary strangers). The vet tech and the vet were both very patient and so very sweet to her throughout the visit. My dog responded very well to their kindness, and actually behaved better for them than she has with any other stranger (even though the mailman has never tried to put a thermometer in her butt!). I'm very happy with how they handled my dog. (Though, from experience, it helps to schedule the first appointment of the morning and call them en route to warn them that a big scared dog is on its way.) They also see my cat, which has also always been a positive experience. (But he's always well behaved at the vet. He's just glad he gets let out of the evil plastic box inside the evil metal box on wheels. He doesn't care what the vet does to him, as long as he's out of the box.)"
1,"Five star service the bone in rub eye was a good size and so favor full and tender that I ate the whole thing , the strawberry shortcake was unbelievable . Unlike anything I had before, my wife loved her scallop and macadanina bread pudding. In fact. It was the olmy bread pudding I liked"

1,"I have always sneered at people who purchase their meat from butcher shops, thinking they are the suckers who are paying more for the same. I knew the meat from the butcher shop would be better, but I didn't think I would be able to taste the difference. Boy was I wrong!\n\nMy wife and I have purchased beef, pork, and fish from this place, and every single time, we could taste the difference. The fish (tried sea bass and salmon) is succulent and has no smells at all. Pork chops were the absolute best I have ever tasted. I never thought I could taste the difference between mass-packaged meat and butcher shop meat, until I actually tried them.\n\nRon is very friendly, and like all good butchers, will make cut and trim your meat for you, as well as making recommendations if you're not sure what you want to have for dinner.\n\nSure, it is a little bit more expensive than what you get from large supermarkets, you really get what you pay for! And in this case, I am more than glad to pay the difference for quality meat from a quality shop!"
1,"Just stopped in the other day to try this place.  It was lunch time so I ordered the BLT with avocado.  My husband (who had the leftovers) agreed it was delicious.  This is big because my husband and I rarely agree on food.  The sandwich is made with thick, cherrywood bacon on toasted french bread,  I had a bowl of the tomato florentine soup, which I didn't care for.\n\nI will be back to try their breakfasts.  A friend of mine tried the pizza scramble and loved it."
1,"what brigid said.  the ip is where it's at for the cheapest gambling on the strip.  however, i hear that they recently got rid of the wheel of madness (tm)!!!   that sucks because there is nothing like getting blackjack and spinning the wheel of madness (tm). NOTHING.  it can cause you to stay at the ip until 5 in the morning when your plane leaves at 6 and you know that you did the right thing whether you make the flight or not."
1,I wish there were more indoor seating. It's like a less awesome Casey Moore's with older people.
1,"Great poached eggs and corned beef hash but wow, salty. Good coffee and great pecan sticky bun - really small so don't skip the \""pastry course\"". Really slow service; we arrived at 9:30am on a Monday and there were about 4 tables of people. However the hostess & waitress for our group of 8 was very nice."
0,"Don't go to this location. My husband and I have given them many chances and they never get it quite right. The bagels are either not toasted enough and cold, TOO toasted to the point of being burnt, and/or not correct because they don't listen to what you want. I don't know if it's from laziness, not caring, or lack of training and communication but whatever it may be- the Blue Diamond location has lost us as customers. The South Rainbow location is far superior and we will be going to that one from now on."
0,"I travel often and like to stay at Delta Hotel's because of their commitment to customer service. Im fact, I am a \""Gold\"" member of their loyalty program. However, this location has proven to be an exception. Sub-par service. The elevators were broken during my entire visit. The facilities are dated. The bathrooms are tiny. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. There are lots of options for hotels in downtown Montreal - I recommend you stay somewhere else."
1,"My favorite quick car wash spot.   Good prices for the car wash.  Be sure to ask for the free cleaning cloth when you pay and you can multi-task and clean the inside of the car as your car glides through the magic car wash.   Free vacuums around the side of the building to finish off the job.  Voila!  15 minutes of your life and a clean car for about $5-10.  Can't go wrong with that!  \n\nOnly complaint - it can get pretty busy so there can be a wait occasionally.  One time I went, the car behind me bumped me while going through the wash.  I told an employee my concerns, and he gave me 50% off my next wash.  Wasn't too happy about it, but there weren't any scratches either and I've been here dozens of other times with no issues.  Watch the distance between you and the car ahead or behind you though."
1,I stopped in for a quick iced peppermint mocha and was very impressed all around. The staff was extremely friendly and excited to chat about the business. This place is not your typical coffee shop. They have tons of space to meet up and relax. They are also an art gallery with some beautiful pieces to look at. Culture is a good way to describe this business because they are really bringing a unique culture and vibe to the downtown Phoenix area. I always excited to discover places like this and support them with my business. I encourage everyone to check this place out and keep it alive!!
0,"This could be a great park...ball fields, playgrounds, picnic areas, walking path, skate park, bathrooms, good parking...but there is dog s**t everywhere. There are ample opportunities for dog owners to be responsible and I'm sure some are but it's hard to tell here."
1,"Bought a Living Social coupon and it was the only reason I would have tried this place. The exterior leaves something to be desired, but don't judge this place by the surroundings or the exterior decor. All the staff members were super nice and very attentive. Even after my treatments were complete they made sure I had anything I needed (water, tea, food, etc..) Had a wonderful massage and the therapist was very conscious of the areas that needed extra attention as well as pressure. The aesthetician was so sweet as well. She mentioned that the facial my package provided me did not include extractions, but since I only had a few areas that need some love she included the extraction process for free. The only thing lacking in is the nail room. Instead of the individual chairs that I'm used to it was a bench with seating for four. A little weird and I didn't really like it, but probably because I'm not used to it. You can get a good massage and facial anywhere, but the staff really make your experience that much more enjoyable. You can tell that everyone likes working there. This place is a diamond in the rough for sure!"
1,Great sushi buffet! The sushi is fresh and the service is great. Nice ambience too. Love the spicy tuna salad-yum! The bacon wrapped scallop is so yummy too! All their rolls r fabulous! Would highly recommend it. This is now my regular spot whenever I'm in Vegas.
0,"Dirty, dirty, dirty place.  The burgers were average.  Dead flies all over the window sills, dead flies mixed with the straws (note straws are packaged but still!!).  The folks are very friendly and the milkshakes are really, really sweet.  I could never go back though due to the cleanliness factor.  Sorry!"
1,"This place is small, but it serves the purpose, so far i have only tried the teriyaki chicken and the new york sushi and they are actually really good. It is conveniently located near ASU which is a plus for me since I have classes that are close by, so whenever I get hungry I walk a block and get a quick snack. Also their boba drinks are amazing!"
1,"When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!"
0,"The location is the only good thing this hotel has going for it. I have stayed here 2 times.\n\nThe room was very clean, as it should be, and the staff were very good.\n\nI give it 2 stars because the AC unit is so loud you cant here yourself think or even sleep. This happened both times I stayed there. \n\nIf you like restaurants to walk to and eat do not go here, there is almost nothing around the area."
1,"We stopped in here late one night to try it out, as we are big fans of Gordon. We ordered the sliders, truffle fries, and of course, the sticky toffee pudding. The sliders were very good and adorable. The fries were perfect and they give you the truffle/ garlic aioli to dip as well as homemade ketchup. Delicious. And dessert- sinful. Soooooo good. Wish I would've ordered my own (sticky toffee pudding), instead of sharing. Lol. Lots and lots of beer on tap, although we didn't have any. Fish & chips too pricey at $30-I just got the fish & chip sandwich at burgr instead. ($16 Very good, but standard). Interesting appetizers but some entrees too fancy for my taste. Pretty place, fun ambiance. I prefer burgr @Planet Hollywood. May return if I am in Cesar's."
0,"I ordered shrimp tempura and sushi assortment.  The fish, shrimp quality is good, but the portion is small and there sushi ratio is kind of wrong: too much rice, too thin, too little fish.  I was also surprised that the tuna piece was seared, not raw as it should be.     Service is very good, but I won't go there again."
1,"I first found Vince's on an emergency situation. Note to all readers don't let your inspection and emissions lapse near a cop. I called as soon as they opened and they had me in that very day. They were also more than accommodating in the fact that my paperwork wasn't all in order but since I was able to prove that insurance and registration were current they were able to finagle some magic within the system to get me cleared and through. The check itself was done quickly and thoroughly to boot. When I was told I needed an new part to pass the inspection (exterior mirror, damn hooligans with bats) they told me they would pass me if I paid parts and labor that day as the new mirror needed to be ordered. I completely understand this. If you are going to put your reputation and possibly your state license on the line you need a guarantee I am coming back. What really shocked me was the bill. Emissions, inspection, parts and labor all came to... a hair over $200. I almost felt like I was robbing THEM! When the part was in they called me to inform me promptly and when I was finally able to get my car in the fix was done before I could get back from the quick stop a block away for my daily caffeine fix. Customer service is top of the mark here. These guys do it right. The only thing that might put a visitor off is the fact that since these are hard working guys who work in a primarily open air/open door garage they do smoke. I don't mind because that is one of my own personal vices (sorry mom) but a non smoker might be put off. I say forget the second hand stuff and go anyway cause these guys are tops at providing great work and some of the best customer service I have ever had at a mechanics place. 5 stars all the way."
0,"I hold that there are a few mortal sins when it comes to running a restaurant.  One of these is swindling your customers with cheap food.  Now, I don't mind cheap food when it comes at cheap prices; in fact, being broke more often than not, I have been known to gladly eat that which is inexpensive.\n\nHowever... serving cheap food at great expense is one of the worst wrongs a restaurant can commit in my eyes.  Our Tuscan pizza cost nearly $14, and it was awful.  The crust was a flavorless cracker, and the \""pesto\"" sauce was nearly nonexistent and very bland even in the spots where it did deign to cover the crust.  The cheese coverage was miserly; the tomatoes were translucent and orange; and there were only two bits of artichoke hearts on the entire pizza.  I could have made a better pizza myself for a quarter of the price.\n\nPhil and Tony's positive word-of-mouth in Matthews baffles me.  Service was attentive, but it was truly one of the worst values I have ever encountered in a restaurant."
1,"Like a lot of locals, I first came to the Hill after a night of drinking (great hangover food!). I've since stopped drinking, but I still depend on this place for a solid breakfast.\n\nThis location has been codenamed \""the good one\"" by Boyfriend and I, so we make the trip on Saturday mornings rather than go to the location right up the street. This location just seems better put together than the others. As a twosome, we are usually seated very quickly. The service is not exceptional, but leaves nothing to be desired. The waitresses are exactly what you'd expect in a diner (after walking in the doors, you have no name. You'll be known as \""honey\"" or \""sweetie\""). \n\nI can honestly say that I've never gotten a non-breakfast item, given that breakfast is awesome and served 24 hours. My guilty pleasure is the eggs benedict. Whether you get actual poached eggs or not is a toss-up, but it's still tasty. Really, I've never been disappointed. \n\nThe Hill is a step down from The Cracked Egg in price and taste, but still quite a few steps from the bottom!"
0,I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service from the check-in desk. Waited in line for over an hour to be told I could not check in yet.
0,"I've stayed at theHotel many time in the last few years, mostly in the winter because, as mentioned in a prior review, the journey through the casino to get to the pool isn't worth the trouble. \nI've never had any reason to dislike theHotel. In fact, I liked it very much.The rooms were nice and confortable, the bar and cafe were great and the staff was excellant. \nOn our last stay we were offered one of the Delano rooms and, regretably, we took it.\nThe room is uncomfortable and uninviting. The furnishings look and feel cheap and incomplete. It's like IKEA hasn't delivered everything yet.\nMaybe, by not liking the new rooms, I'm showing my complete lack of any sense of style but, I found much of the staff (speaking off the record) agreed with me. \nI wish them luck but I won't be coming back. There are plenty of other, much nicer,\nrooms available."
0,"The two stars are bonus points, but it gets the basics wrong.\n\npro: \n- Bright, airy\n- I never need to walk miles to get to the terminal \n- Very cool statues greet people to the Queen City, those always put a smile on my face. \n\ncons: \n- No restaurants or bars available to hang out with family and friends and wait for the (often delayed) departing flight. That's a deal breaker for me. Security checks are here to stay, do something about it. \n\n- TSA agents are often rude and overly aggressive. Yes, compared to other big cities. \n\n- Employing bathroom attendants, News Break: hello, the fifties are over! \n\n- Not enough airlines service Charlotte or compete for its business. \n\n- Not enough direct flights in or out. Unless I want to make the trip 4 hours longer that need be, the only direct flights to London are with USfreakingAirways. For a wannabe INTERNATIONAL HUB that's not too famous."
1,"We went to Charlestons late Saturday night and ordered a little bit of everything. The quacamole was delicious but I don't see why they put it on shredded lettuce because that sort of ruined the consistency of the quac for me. The baked potato soup is always perfection. The steak had great flavor, we ordered it medium and it was more medium well but still tasty. The server was attentive but not overwhelming and the manager stopped by to thank us for coming in. We always enjoy our experiences at all of the Charlestons locations and will keep coming back!"
1,"This place looks like my house growing up in the 80s, hideous wood paneling and boring paintings of sailboats included. So take my advice and look down at your plate instead of looking at the walls because the food was delicious.  \n\nThe wedge salad was superb as wedge salads usually are. The bacon wrapped shrimp and the tomato/mozzarella were great appetizers. Steaks are the way to go here and the mushroom side dish was pretty damn amazing. They also have an impressive dessert menu including cheesecake from Carnegie deli in NY and this ice cream ball monstrosity."
0,"This place is not a \""true\"" Italian restaurant, but it is a true Italian-American restaurant. After you eat here, you feel very heavy and full. After eating a true Italian meal, you'd feel full but very satisfied. The food is served family style, so multiple portions come on one plate-so hopefully you and the rest of your friends like the same things. I don't like the decorations on the wall. Just pictures upon pictures of people and objects. It looks like a Spaghetti Warehouse. The waitress we had was very nice, but her shirt was really dirty, which somewhat concerned me. The food was much better the second time that I came here. There are coupons that you can sign up for, and I suggest that you do. The food items are not cheap."
1,"Just read all the reviews on Oscar's Pier 83 and decided that as Mainahs with a hankerin' for some haddock we'd give it a whirl.  Was shocked to find how close it was to where we live and that we've been driving past it all the time we were whining about how much we missed seafood!  We had the haddock fish and chips since haddock is hard to find anywhere around here.  It was great!  The fish and chips came with fries and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was excellent, the fries a little on the thin side for us.  The tartar sauce was a very nice flavor as well.  The gentleman at the counter was very welcoming and made some small talk with my husband about New England and being from Maine.  We will be back!  Cant wait to try the fish tacos, the shrimp and the broiled seafood options!  Eh-yup, it was \""some wicked good.\"""
0,Good but very pricy!!! Not worth the cost. Family of 4 30 bucks!!  Plus there wasnt even enough. After the small cups were done the kids wanted more. Maybe thats what the owner has planned. Really!! U can take family of 4 to a Resturant and get desert for the same price. I miss Cold Stone. The employees were awesome tho!
1,"Fantastic!  Food was great and unique.  Scotty was attentive, humorous and knowledgeable.  I would recommend multiple visits because everything we tried was great.  We actually went two nights in a row."
1,"One of my favorite spots in Vegas. I have had several great meals here. The Sommelier was fantastic, friendly and made some really great pairings. If you'd like a tasty fun cocktail, try their cable car. Again, Michael Mina can do no wrong by me."
0,"Wouldn't it be just wonderful to know all of these reviews are a complete & accurate description of this place? Well, I've a review to write & this may sting a bit...but it is completely true & honest.\nYes, rabbits are wonderful pets & hoping to fill my bunny-void with more bunny-love I turned to Brambley...even drove out from Albuquerque (8-hrs away) After working with the staff for several weeks, completing much paperwork, I was ready to make the trip to meet Rosa-Marie for the first time. She was just 2 or 3 at the time. I brought her back to Albuquerque where she was a welcome addition to our family & a favorite of my daughters. She lived with us for about 5-yrs or so. \nAround Oct.'13 Rosa escaped from her hutch, through our fence gate which had blown open during high winds. This had never before occurred. She was subsequently hit by a car (my neighbor) who took her into the animal shelter. The animal shelter scanned her for a microchip & saw that she 'belonged' to Brambley Hedge Rabbit Rescue Group in AZ. Brambley phoned me at work & asked me where Rosa was. Of course I was beside myself confused; not only that after 5-yrs they were calling with such a silly question, but that her where-abouts were in question at all. They were very accusatory & rude to the point reluctantly providing me with any information on MY RABBIT of 5-yrs. I was finally able to speak to a manager who informed me on what occurred. I contacted the animal shelter & indicated i would be there immediately but upon arriving with my daughter was told they were stuck in the middle & could not give me back my injured rabbit. The director of animal services called Brambley & we discussed the matter via speakerphone. The words out of the mouth of Brambley was that they would hire an attorney & sue if Rosa left the facility. Nevermind she was lying in pain waiting with a mangled broken back leg & that I was ready to spend whatever it cost to get her well, nevermind my daughter sat there crying because this insane volunteer kept repeating that it was our fault Rosa was hurt...Nevermind she had been in our care in a superb environment with inside/outside home access for the past 5 YEARS. What it came down to was transfer of ownership and Brambley never made me the rightful owner, despite paying over $100 to 'adopt' her, the intention was to never do so. They still owned Rosa. They leased me a pet rabbit. Whoever heard of such a thing?! They decided she was not being properly cared for (despite this one-time freak accident). They decided they would come get her. I could not give the go-ahead for her necessary leg amputation. She lay waiting for days for this fanatical group to get their S*** in order and ultimately she ended up passing away during her surgery. The director of the animal shelter in Alb indicated her age had more to do with her passing but that laying around waiting did not help. He(director) also disclosed to me that this is not the first time such illogical, erratic, ignorant rescue group actions have benefitted noone. \n*****If you decide to \""Adopt\"" from this crazy outfit, check that chip & make sure the animal is yours....you just may have a leased pet on your hands & they may decide to come get it after as many years, after you have grown attached to your new family member....Tragic for a 7-yr old & myself..\nShame on you Brambley~ for letting down an innocent rabbit who lay suffering waiting for someone to help her."
0,"I honestly dont know why they are still open. I bought their livingsocial deal and it was about to expire so I hurried to use it with my boyfriend. As we we found the resto and entered, I found the decoration pleasing but as we sat down and saw the menu for our livingsocial coupon...NOT IMPRESSED! I found the prices for the appetizers to be ridiculous and not worth it. We were only allowed to pick a limit of 7$ for the appetizers which is ridiculous because there was only 2 items: the soup du jour and a really not so good bruschetta. I took the bruschetta and my boyfriend took the soup. I would NEVER pay 6.95$ for neither. \n\nAfter the main course had a limit of 17$. I took the 4 cheeses pizza which was really good because of its thin crust and my bf took a plain spaghetti cuz he is lactose intolerant. But cmon....16.95$ for a plain spaghetti screams overpriced! \n\nLast but not least, i wanted a classic italian dessert that was homemade....nothing was homemade on the dessert menu. very disappointing! \n\nI also really got annoyed because when i usually use a livingsocial coupon, I have never been asked to print it and I basically just show it and they write down the voucher number. The lady who is probably the owner, didnt stop annoying me about printing it and then she comes to me with a paper with their email and pressed me to email them the coupon and didnt stop harassing me about the damn coupon. \n\nreally disappointed!!! Never again will I ever go to the resto! U have my word"
0,"Soooo disappointed!! \n\nI stayed 2 nights at the belle suite for my bachlorette and it was a bad experience from day one. I don't even know where to start... \n\n1. The service was horrible!! It took them almost 1 1/2 hours to bring us fresh towels and 35 minutes for more toilet paper, not to mention they only brought one roll for a group of people in a suite!!!! I had to go find a cleaning lady because it took to damn long. \n\n2. Rude! Rude! Rude Security! My friend forgot her room key and she asked if he could page someone to let her up and he said \""don't you see I'm dealing with more important stuff\"", as if the other guest was more important than her. \n\n3. We had noooo signal for Internet at all and no phone service at all either \n\n4. Our room keys kept getting inactivated so we had to walk EVERYTIME downstairs for replacement keys\n\n5. There was a puddle of water on the floor which made me almost fall!\n\n6. We checked out at 10:50 and asked for bell hop and he arrived at 11:45! I understand they are busy but really almost an hour for a bellhop!?\n\nI would have rather stayed at a motel 6 because I feel that it is the type of service I paid for. I will never stay there again. Beautiful interior but even the room didn't seem worth the price. I paid too much for a horrible hotel experience."
0,Its a racket.
0,Worst location. Terrible service! I've been to this location twice and they have no clue what they are doing. I ordered a plain cheeseburger and they gave me a hamburger. They gave no condiments at all. Last time I came here I waited 25 minutes in my car before finally going inside and getting a refund. CLEAN It Up Culver's or you'll have seen the last of me. I don't care if your foods good or not.
0,"Some how my review got deleted!!  Probably some of the most awful/over priced sushi I've ever eaten!! I am a crazy sushi lover!! I just moved to Arizona from LA, ca and I've been checking out different sushi joints....trying to find the best one in AZ. This place was crazy over priced for the crap food they gave us! My husband got salmon and I got a few rolls. The food quality was AWFUL! The service sucked! I don't mind paying $100 for a few sushi rolls, soup, and some salmon, but it better be good! Sadly it was not, the rolls were small and very thin...the rice was hard! This was the first time in my whole 22 years of eating sushi that I've ever experienced hard rice on a sushi roll!! On a better note, the salmon and soup was pretty good! I will NEVER return to this place......"
1,"Urban Warfit Crossfit 602 welcomed me and my wife right away after it didnt work out at another box. From day one they made us feel like we have been going there for years. Roman, Ken, and the other coaches are very knowledgeable and friendly.  Urban Warfit Cossfit 602 has the best community hands down....I've made great friends and reached PRs thanks to the community, coaching and programming at Urban. So come out and join us you will not regret it."
1,"On a bright late Sunday morning, the four of us didn't have to wait too long (@20-30 mins), for this caliber of a restaurant.  We went before our flight back home so we had our luggage.  The hostess took our bags and checked them in a separate room so we could eat comfortably.  \n\nThe servers team worked like a well oiled machine.  We probably had 4 servers tend to us, like they worked as a team to make us happy.  As a former server, I LOVE when that happens.   The servers, informed us well on the specials, asked to prepare the foie gras for us, always had our water glasses filled (very important after a Saturday night/Sunday morning in Vegas), and were attentive without being to nosy (love when this happens as well).\n\nFrom the taste and presentation, the food was spectacular.  The bread comes out in the shape of leaves.  Then starting out the foie gras appetizer was decadent, 2.5 oz, would have been enough for us, the mussels were so fresh, and even the olives in the bloody marys had a freshness to them.  \nAs for the entrees, all of us were very pleased with what we got.   I had gotten their signature dish, the prefectly cooked roasted chicken and chive waffles, accompanied with chicken gravy, maple syrup, and vanilla bean butter.  All of it was amazing, except for the gravy, that was just way too salfty for me, and I love salt.  Nonetheless, the meal was delicious and didn't even need the gravy so it was all good.\n\nDefinitely a great place for brunch."
0,"So this Denny's on Fremont is a mess late nights. \n\nWe were not greeted when we walked in, it took way too long to be seated.\n\nIt seems that most the servers had been partying, some seem wired etc.\n\nSeveral times I had to ask for a side of the same sauce, twice she brought the wrong drink..\n\nThen waitress openly tells us \""oops, you can tell I drink\"" what the what?!?\n\nFood was ok but rushed and looked messy.\n\nI will only eat at this Denny's again if I'm more drunk then I was last time.\n\nGreat spot for cheap drinks (reason for 2nd star)"
0,"On my recent trip to Las Vegas, I booked a car through HotWire, thinking I would get the cheapest rate.  When the price of $13 a day came up, under Dollar, I figured you can't beat that!  In Dollar's defense, I should have signed on to Yelp and read the reviews already posted because the experience I had mirrored most of the experiences of other Yelp reviewers.  I have rented many cars in my life, for work and for vacation, and I have never felt like a rental car company was trying to swindle me more than Dollar.  \n\nWhen I arrived at McCarran Rental Center, the line for Dollar was triple what all the other car company lines were.  Thinking that it was simply because Dollar offered the best deals on cars, I got in line.  It was soon apparent that the line was not moving at an efficient pace at all.  When I first got in line, I counted six attendants helping customers.  Yet, each time an attendant finished working with his or her immediate customer, he or she would take a break.  Within ten minutes there were only two attendants left.  The other thing I started to notice was that customers would take 20-30 minutes a time to rent a car.  I surveyed the line around me and determined that everyone already had reservations, so what was taking so long?  One group was talking to the attendant the whole time I was standing in line.  They were still there when I left!  Finally, an hour later I was in the front of the line.  A couple finished up, and of course, the attendant went on break!  Ten minutes later I was finally speaking to someone.  That is when I realized why everyone was taking so long.  Dollar instructs its attendants to try to get as much money out of the customer as possible.  While I was standing in line I noticed that every time a customer was at the desk, the attendant would turn his or her computer around to show the customer the screen.  This was to show the different cars available and the respective prices.  But we all have reservations already, right?  Well my reservation was for the \""manager's special\"" which was a gas guzzling Crown Victoria.  I asked if there was something more efficient and he told me it would cost an extra $100, but he could give me a \""deal\"".  The long line and slow service is meant to wear the customer down to the point where he or she will agree to anything just to get out of the airport.  I am not upset that I decided to pay an extra $30 for the more efficient car (as I probably saved that in gas), but I am just so frustrated that so much of my vacation time was wasted dealing with this rental car company.  Every time I go to Vegas, I already feel like I can't trust anyone I speak to, why should I feel that way with a car company, even before I have left the airport?"
1,"Okay when it come to salad bars Sweet Tomatoes by far tops the competition such as Soup or Salad or your run of the mill salad bar. I usually go here with a buddy or two for lunch about once a week what's really nice is if you sign up for their news letter, they send out coupons usually twice a month so someone is always eating in our group for free or 50% off. \n\nAnd what is really nice is they have different specials every month at this place so you are always able to try new things. \n\nThe vegetables seem fresher here,  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars, and they definitely have more of a selection then most places, so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups, baked potatoes, pizza and other such dishes to choose from.\n\nThe staff is really good here and this place is very clean and everyone does a great job in making sure you are getting everything you need. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is the fact that I feel it is a bit pricey for a salad bar."
1,"So I was fortunate enough to have an friend take me here for dinner my first week  in town.  This place is legit!  \n\nThe menu changes constantly and is based on what is fresh and at its best.  For the reason, we decided to go with the tasting menu and paired wines.  Now this option wasn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but MY GOODNESS was it worth it.  Since they offered a vegetarian options, we ordered that as well as the omnivorous version.  It was great because we were able to taste the best of both worlds. There were at least 5 courses and wow. They were all stand outs. By the time we got to dessert, we were almost stuffed! That's great because often times tasting menus can be downright paltry.  \n\nOh and the wines.  I'm swooning just thinking about the wines that they chose per course.  Some American, but also Italian, Spanish and French. Again, totally worth what we paid for it.  \n\nNow service was a bit spotty. Our waitress was AMAZING and the hostesses were completely sweet. But some of the food runners were more on point than others. We asked one of them about what was on our plates, since she hadn't announced it when she brought it to the table. Unfortunately, she had no clue.  So we learned not to ask her any questions and kept it moving.   A very minor slight though.\n\nIn short: if you want to take a date somewhere that you can pretty much guarantee a happy ending to the night, Legume is your choice.   Parents coming to town and want to pay for dinner? Legume all day.  I really hope to go back again sometime soon."
1,This is really an exceptional italian deli!  Great sandwich's - great atmosphere.  Would certainly come again when in the Scottsdale area.
1,"This is restaurant is undoubtedly understaffed. There were two employees at the front in charge of hosting, waiting, and busing all of the tables as well as managing phone orders. It was obvious they were stressed and continuously in a rush. Having one more employee working the front would make dining here flow significantly smoother. Based on the prices of the entrees, it seems management should be able to afford another server.\n\nThe prices for the Korean entrees are high. The menu items under Korean BBQ averaged about $30 per entree. In order to use the stoves at the table you need to order at least two of such entrees. Also, the BBQ portions are limited. In New York, I've seen Korean BBQ buffets for $30 per person, but never this much for just one portion of Bulgogi or Spare Ribs. The Korean non-BBQ dishes average over $20 per entree.\n\nThe Japanese and Korean-Chinese dishes were priced com the range of about $7 - $20 with different prices during lunch or dinner for certain items.\n\nI opted for the Ban Jai (steak and shrimp). My only complaint was that the steak was well done; otherwise, the shrimp and mushrooms were good. The Nam Jai is a bento box which also came with fried dumplings, fried rice, crab sticks, kimchi, and cucumber & carrot salad. I thought all of the sides except the crabmeat were very good.\n\nI think Korea Garden has some of the best Asian good on Oakland. I would certainly return for a different bento box!\n\nOh, and paper towels are located outside the restrooms."
1,"Just like Sonic I miss this place so much. I have not found a place that can come even close in Boston to the unreal Mexican food \""Betos\"" had 24/7. Nothing beat hitting up Betos after a night of drinking or even hitting it up at 7am for a breakfast burrito. You cannot beat their prices, the breakfast burritos are less than 2 bucks and their bigger and as heavy as a brick. Betos will you and Sonic please move franchises to Boston."
1,"What is better than a little brunch after partying the night before? A champagne brunch in  what seems like is the middle of the village from Beauty and the Beast!!!\n\nYou have to wait in line so take that into account when you make plans to go. My bf and I got there at 9:15am and got seated exactly at 10am. The champagne brunch starts at 10, so we were totally fine with that. \n\nAt first, the service seemed to be a little off because they were so busy, but then we had this wonderful lady who was extremely attentive. I'm bummed I can't remember her name, but she was awesome. She actually just gave us a cold bottle of champagne, since we kept on getting refills, and she continued to refill our flutes after. \n\nThe food quality and selection was wonderful..they have fresh crepes, omelets, a sushi chef (basic stuff), crab legs (nom nom nom) and creme brulee (my favorite dessert) that they were actually caramelizing in from of you.\n\nAt about 30 bucks a person, it's well worth it. Just be prepared to wait."
0,"So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind."
1,"Mike gave us a fair quote via email to install some ceiling fans. We scheduled an install date and time.  Mike was running a bit behind the scheduled appointment time. When he arrived, he very efficiently walked through the job, looked at the fans we had purchased and got to work.  The final price ended up being right at what we were quoted. \n\nWe will definitely use Mike and Good Guys again."
0,"Wow.  I have NEVER not left a tip but my service was so horrible I put a big fat zero on the tip line.  What astonished me was when I went to give my paid check to the manager to make sure he knew how dissatisfied I was, I was told my horrible server was the manager!\n\nThat being said, the food is great and in the past I enjoyed eating at the sushi bar.  But I will NEVER eat at a table again and I will not take my family (meaning visits will be far and few between).  \n\nIn family centric Anthem, this place will not survive with the current manager at the helm.  With the good food, I hope the problem is remedied soon.\n\nSome specifics on the service:\n- It took forever to get our order taken so I took my boys on a walk while my husband ordered (plus, they failed to give us a pencil for our sushi order sheet).\n- When our first order of sushi came out, we didn't have any sushi sets.  When I asked our waiter/the manager for some, he looked at me like I was crazy and said, you mean the little bowls?  When I tried to also add we needed ginger and wasabi he seemed very confused and finally said, oh ginger.\n- It wasn't until after the tempura, then cucumber salad, then sushi order, and finally the next sushi order that he brought the kids meals out (by then, my kids were fit to be tied!).  He failed to bring a fork and knife.  I waited a bit, and finally ran around the restaurant to find him.  When I did, he said it would take a minute because he was entering in an order (mind you, I had a boy desperately waiting to eat his chicken fingers but the were huge and hot so they needed to be cut, he's 2, and chopsticks were useless to cut the chicken with).  I don't know why he couldn't just ask someone else to get them for me, it isn't often a customer comes and hunts you down, it usually means they are desperate for service!\n- He brought the silverware, and ran off, while our drinks were completely empty.  Had to wave him down again to get water refills.\n- The final straw was at then end.  He asked if we wanted anything else, and three times, I said the check please (anyone could tell at that point I was frustrated and ready to just leave).  He brought the check over (by then, my dad and son had left the restaurant, my husband was packing up my other son).  He then left for a LONG time.  I saw him on the other side of the restaurant just hanging out talking casually with a waitress.  I waited, and waited.  My husband left and I am now all alone at the table.  I get up and try to pay the hostess - can't.  She finally gets the waiter/manager.  But seriously - your a waiter/manager., your customer tells you three times to just bring the check, the table clears out with just one person left who is staring at you WAITING for to pay the bill --- Did I really have to go ask the hostess, and why couldn't the hostess cash me out?!?\n\nThere were 1000 other little things the whole evening that had me tearing my hair out.  In all, I will NEVER return with my family.  That being said, unless I find another sushi place in Anthem, the food is good enough to return to the sushi bar when my husband and I want a quiet night out and Grandpa can babysit the boys."
1,"Amazing and authentic Japanese food! Came here late night on a Monday.  It was close to 1am and the place was packed, there's wasnt an empty table anywhere.  Only a handful of customers weren't Asian.  The waitress was super friendly and very helpful. I got the eel with cucumber, a friend's recommendation, and it was soo good!  I also got sushi, it was shrimp and topped with a delicious piece of tuna.  Loved it!  I also enjoyed the DIY drink.  The sell Shochu, tastes kind of like vodka, very mild flavor. They serve it with club soda and your choice of fruit (or plain on the rocks).  I ordered it with grapefruit and they brought me half of a fresh grapefruit and a manual glass juicer and a shot of simple syrup. And voila, you make your own drink!  Will definitely came again next time I'm in Vegas!"
0,"Not very impressed with the restaurant.  Being from Mexico, we know authentic food.  This restaurant was at best 70% authentic. Wife and I ate there a few times and found the taste was never consistent. The wait staff is unprofessional in appearance.  You don't know who works there.  No uniforms or even shirts saying Cinco.  One worker was at least wearing a Mexican soccer jersey and that made us at least feel someone was trying to be authentic.  Unkempt appearances of the wait staff make you feel like you are in a cheap bar.\n\nOur latest visit was on Sept 16th (Mexico's Independence Day).  The owners did nothing to promote this.  This was a huge disappointment for the someone of Hispanic decent. I guess the owners would rather \""sell out\"" and be an \""Americanized Mexican\"" restaurant than truly be authentic.\n\nOther visits to the restaurant we experienced dirty glasses piled up on the bar near the ice maker.  I also noticed a bartender using her hands in addition to a glass to scoop ice from the ice machine.  Dirty!!!! No, I don't want ice in my drink.  I should have called the health department on that one.  \n\nHappy hour prices.  Watch out for this catch!  Happy hour drinks and appetizers are advertised on a sign at the door.  These are for only at the bar, not at a table. Not all of the appetizers are on special either.  \n\nOverall I have been disappointed. Food is just okay and  never consistent in taste.  Prices are a bit high for what you get.  But then again, they are located in an upper middle class neighborhood.  I hate to say it, but I don't expect them to last very long.  Poor service, less than good food, unprofessional staff and high prices will drive them out of business.  I hope the owner changes some things at this restaurant.  It would be good to see a place that serves truly authentic Mexican food."
0,Just awful. So called 'asada burrito' was cold and bland... just a lump of plain carnitas and some iceberg lettuce in a cheap tortilla. reminiscent of Taco Bell in the 90s but worse.
1,"Mom and pop shop. Hole in the wall. Locally owned. Take your pick. Actually all three apply. Before my initial thoughts, here's the back story.\n\nAfter speaking with the owner Mike and the nice server Celeste, I found out that this place is an actual truck stop/wash. They decided to start serving breakfast and lunch because of all the numerous truckers coming in complaining about eating fast food at the McDonald's on the corner.\n\nSo SNS Diner (SNS stands for Southern Nevada Services) was born. They have been open for about a year. They are located off of Colton but the main cross street is Losee Road. As soon as you turn on to Colton, the place is on your right. Just look for the barbeque signs. At first look you might think that this place could be where they would film a CSI episode. But after coming out of your car, the smell of would smoke (hickory maybe? I should of asked) should tell you that there is some good smoking going on and im not talking about weed.\n\nNow for main reasons why you should go here: The good food and great service.\n\nFor breakfast I have had the Biscuits and Gravy ($6.99), Pastrami Hash ($8.99), Eggs Benedict ($8.99), and 2 Eggs over easy with Bacon and Potatoes (6.99).\n\nThe Biscuits and Gravy came highly recommended so that was the first item my wife was looking forward to. The gravy itself has breakfast sausage mixed in it and had a little bit of a kick to it. After taking one bite you will know that the biscuits were made fresh from scratch.\n\nThe Pastrami Hash was just a tad bit salty but with a bit of ketchup or barbeque sauce it rounds out the flavor. I can only assume the bit of saltiness is from the chopped up bits of pastrami. With that it is comprised of green peppers, onions, scrambled eggs, and black pepper. It it topped off with 2 fried eggs cooked to your liking.\n\nThe Eggs Benedict were decent. They were definitely better than the ones I had a couple weeks ago at another breakfast joint.\n\nThe 2 eggs and bacon with home fries were just average.\n\n\n\nFor lunch, (this is where they will definitely keep me coming back) I have had the 3 Meat Combo ($13.99) and the Rib Tip Sandwich ($8.50).\n\nThe 3 Meat Combo you have your choice of ribs, chicken, brisket, or pulled pork, all which have been smoked for whatever designated time they did it for. I went with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The St Louis Ribs have this rub on it that makes it very flavorful. It's not fall off the bone tender but tender enough for you to eat it off the bone with ease. The Brisket was juicy and tender as well. The Pulled Pork was good too. The common theme for all these meats is that they all have the great smoke flavoring and are not dry at all as evidenced by the juices at the bottom of your foil lining of your basket.\n\nThe Rib Tip Sandwich originally I thought it said Tri Tip so when I got my sandwich I was surprised to see that the chopped bits of meat were actually rib tips. Nevertheless it was good. So good in fact that I didnt even need the bread just to eat the meat! Dont get me wrong, the bread was good too! It was all buttered up and grilled to a slight crispiness on the inner portion. the rib tips also had a mixture of some kind of rub that has a kick to it. The plate comes with Carolina Mustard and a Vinaigrette Slaw that is usually in the sandwich but they will ask you if you want it on the side instead of inside the sandwich. Both plates come with your choice of one side which consists of Mac n Cheese, Smoked Beans, Smoked Beans and Rice, Green Salad, Vinaigrette Slaw, or Potato Salad. All are good choices.\n\nService is excellent! Celeste constantly walks around making sure you are ok. Sometimes Mike the owner will stop by and confirm that everything was ok.\n\nSome random info: Business hours are Monday thru friday 7 am to 4 pm and Saturday 7 am to 2 pm. Closed Sundays. Breakfast hours are until 10 am. You can only order breakfast. After 10 lunch items only. They take cards.\n\nIn closing, I say give this place a chance. Even though it is kind of in a hidden spot, you will definitely remember where they are once you eat here! I know the hours dont extend into the dinner slot but you gotta remember, this place was originally for truckers making their way through town during the day. Im sure once they start getting busier the owner will have to do something about it, which was pretty much my last comment right before I left. Also I keep wanting to try their berry cobbler which other Yelpers have mentioned but I always find myself too full to order it! \n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #194"
0,"Blueberry Hill serves up completely average diner food.  It has it's purpose, though, and it makes great late-night or hangover food.  My chorizo \""omelet\"" came out as more of a scramble, and only tasted \""OK\"".  If you're looking for a local, family-owned alternative to IHOP that's still open 24 hours, this is your place.  It's a strange little restaurant, layout-wise, but on the plus side, they do have booths for odd numbered groups of 3, 5, etc...  The service was honestly just bad.  We rotated between 2 different waiters, and neither of them really paid us much attention.  To top off the misery, the guy at the cash register was one of the most pessimistic people I've encountered.  When my friend's credit card wouldn't swipe on the first try, he grumbled, \""At lest you *have* credit... Most people in the country don't!\""  Nice...  Blueberry Hill will serve in a pinch, but there have got to be better local 24 hour food options in Vegas..."
0,"I would rather eat fast food before enduring through this experience again. I ordered a masala dosa and what came was a soggy crust with watery masala and a poor attempt with serving store bought chatni. As soon as you enter the place on the left is a pile of trash with happy flies scavenging while the area smells like spices. Between all of that they are trying to sell pastries so even though the cake was edible the environment takes all the joy out for me. Only redeeming factor may be perhaps that they do not overcharge on most items on menu.  I doubt even kitchen nightmares would be able to help. No thanks, moving right along."
1,"I'm not saying Luv-it is the greatest....I mean it is in a crappy neighborhood next to AM-PM and Olympic Gardens. But their custard is really pretty good. I like sundae with Marshmallow creme, hot fudge, pecans....I think it's Desert Sundae but I like to add bananas. \nThey also have frozen bananas, malts - shakes etc....\nNow in true Myke fashion - I shall attempt to plagerize what other yelpers have said about it!. Because after 19 reviews - I agree with a lot of it.\nLuv-It has become somewhat of a secret lately, and it's kinda a fun one.  Everyone used to know Luv-It.  It's been around FOREVER.  It's where you went to get frozen treats, man.  Located by my high school, we'd stop off and grab a cone or a cup before heading back for class.  It was 1995, my shoes were chunky, and I had a cone of Luv-It.  Life was awesome!\n  Found out they have been in the same old rented building since 1973, no wonder it looks like it's been there a while.  That didn't stop me from trying their famous \""Western Sundae.\""  It was out of this world:  Hot Fudge, Hot Caramel, and Salted Pecans.  It doesn't get better than that.  Their line was at least 50 people deep waiting for this stuff.  \nHahaha it's hot right now - go to luv it's and love it!"
0,"I find it hard to believe that this restaurant received an average of 4 stars. \n\n1) Food - the food was decent, although $18 for spaghetti and a couple of meatballs? Filet mignon meatballs? This was an average dish, but supposedly one of the 'go to' dishes. \n\n2) Service - terrible. We never were offered additional bread, and perhaps after we didn't order wine with dinner, this caused the poor service. Our waiter never came to our table again until it was time for the bill. \n\n3) Value- see #1, sorry. I've been to Nora's in Las Vegas before (should have gone there instead). That's awesome Italian food. This place is very overpriced for what you get. \n\nThis restaurant was a major disappointment especially considering the price. It looks nice from the outside before entering, but afterwards, it was a major disappointment. \n\nToo bad I took my wife for an occasion dinner here."
0,I had to wait almost two hours for my license renewal in May. It is the new 8 year license so you can not do it on line. I am actually good with that in theory I am good for almost the next decade. My issue is now I am trying to get my registration decal. I renewed on line in time and it been almost 30 days. The problem is when I changed my address for my for my driver's license it did not change the address for my vehicle registration. WHY? So my decal is sent to my old address so you might as well have burned it. I have attempted to change my address now on line several times and can't it says my address is outside the United States. This is pissing me off and I ultimately envision another couple of hours down at DMV.. just bite me..
0,"This place is supposed to come every 6 weeks to groom my dog.  Since April, they have shown up twice.  There was no explanation for the lapses.  Additionally, every time the groomer came, she was late for the appointment.  They charged $75 for my lab/chow mix.  A local grooming shop I found is great and only charged $45 for a better job."
0,"It's been a while since I've been to Pizzedelic, so I thought it would be fun to give it a try again. My wife and I had dinner here this week with our 2 year old son, and I was very surprised by the poor quality food and the terrible service. \n\nFirst let's start with the food. We started with some cod fritters that were overcooked and barely had any cod in then. Then my chicken pizza was so dry and tasteless that I felt like I was eating a piece of cardboard. It was barely edible, and I did not enjoy it at all. My wife had a pasta dish and she thought it was OK but not great, so obviously not all of the food is bad. They have a great deal on a kids pizza - it's just $1 if an adult orders a regular pizza. I actually liked my son's plain cheese pizza better than mine. \n\nNow the service. It's obvious that the owners hire based on looks, not skill (is that legal?). Everyone is very attractive, but you can tell they hate working there. They did not seem happy that we had a baby, and they did the bare minimum to get us set up with a table. When my son accidentally knocked over and broke a glass (kids will be kids) several of the staff noticed, but not one person came over to help us. We ended up cleaning it all up ourselves. It took us about 5 minutes to get it all clean, and during this time no one came by to see if we needed any assistance, they just totally ignored us. I have never had that happen before at a restaurant. They brought our food, they took our money, all without a smile. These are unhappy people. \n\nSo I give them 1 star for my wife's pasta, and 1 star for the price of the kids food. But I highly suggest you find a different place to eat."
0,"I didn't realize this was a chain until I got my receipt.  Damn it!  I like to frequent local businesses when I travel the country.  Oh well!  I pulled into the last open spot in the parking lot meaning the place was packed.  I was told I could sit in the bar area and find my own spot or wait for a table to open up.  I opted for the bar area and found a small table right away.  The portions here are huge.  I had the BBQ bacon burger.  It was juicy and good.  However, I guess when you order it without greens and tomatoes it means you don't want sauce either.  Their beer selection isn't half bad.  I had the CJ Hefeweizen which was tasty.  The service was slow as shit."
1,"I've only used Sunset Park for the dog park.\n\nSunset park has two dogs parks located on the south side of the park (warm springs side). One park is for the bigger dogs while the other is for smaller dogs.\n\nBoth enclosed dog areas are very big and have plenty of room for dogs to run around. Their are hoses at the park so that people are able to wash their dogs or fill up water bowls. The parks as well offer poopie bags incase you forget you own.\n\nThey is a shaded area with tables for owners to sit and relax while dogs have fun playing.\n\nMy only issue with this place is those that frequent it often and feel entitled as royalty. I bring my dog here when I'm in the area and she isn't very social. She likes me to walk with her and if I sit down, she lays next to me. Dogs at times don't understand personal space and wouldn't let her be. The owners don't help if others dogs were pestering her or playing too rough. I believe one of the regulars said something to the point as, \""if you don't want rough dog play, don't bring your dog here.\""\n\nOutside that, it's great. It's just those days when you have the \""Michael Vick Battle Dog Owners\"""
0,"I have been a fan ofthis restaurant, and have recommended it to several people in the past, but had a horrible experience yesterday. I feel strongly enough about my experience that I joined yelp today just to review this restaurant. The food as always was excellent, but the overall experience was horrible. I figured I would avoid the usual long wait that always seems to be the way it is at this restaurant, so I called ahead. I ordered a whole fried chicken and the ribs and pork shoulder. I checked to make sure my order was right before leaving, but didn't think to actually count the chicken pieces. When I got home, I found there was only half a chicken. When I called to explain, I made what I thought were concrete plans to come back at 2 forthem to give me the other half chicken. Well, when I came at 2, no one even aknowledged that I was there for 15 minutes. no joke. I waited 15 minutes for anyone to even aknowledge I was there. When I was finally greeted by the same person who had taken my order initially, who had given me the food the first time, and who fielded my call when I called back, she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. So after explaining again I was told to wait again. At that point she started bringing out chicken for all trhe seated customers, and other to go orders. I was put at the bottom of the priority list, and literally waited another 10 minutes. I finally went to the back area, and asked for my $ back, and the general attitude was that I was being unreasonable. They handed me my half chicken, no apology, or explanation was given. I felt as if I was bothering them. It was a horrible experience, and it will be a while before I give them another chance. I am very understanding that mistakes hapopen, but feel a little more customer service would be in order especially since I've spent hundreds of dollars there over this past year... very very disappointed!"
0,This is the first time Yelp reviews have let me down. I tried this new location due to the reviews and being 5 mins from my job. I opted for a manicure and shellac. Three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel. I called the salon and they asked I return and have the shellac redone. I did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling. This has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels. This was a waste of money and especially time!!
0,"Eh. It was OK. \n\nI ordered sweet and sour chicken for my kids, which they normally love, but this... this was more like sweet and sour jello. The sauce was incredibly thick and lumpy. I've never seen anything quite like that before. \n\nThe General Tso's was average. \n\nThe dumplings were OK, but rather small. \n\nWe won't be going back anytime soon."
1,"As soon was i got in the waiter she greeted me and seem very nice. I asked  for a to go menu. I looked over the menu and everything seems good and cheap. I decided to get something off the lunch special. I wanted to try the L26 Fillet of fish w/Black bean sauce. The lunch special range from $5.75-$6.45 w/ soup of the day, egg roll, lo mein, fried rice or white rice.The place was clean and friendly.  After I ordered my food it took about 10 minutes for it to be finished. When I got home and about to eat my lunch I was disappointed that it was not what I ordered. It happened to be L21 Shrimp w/Snow peas. I ate it anyways. Wow, it was really good and flavorful. I've had this dish before and it was usually bland. The dish consist of shrimp, water chestnut, carrots, and snow peas. Every bite from the vegetable was crunchy so fresh. Shrimp was on point with the fried rice. I would come back and try other dishes."
0,"I went on a Friday night with a large group of coworkers after a long week. It was one of the most horrendous nightlife experiences in the two years I've lived in Vegas. The atmosphere isn't too bad but it isn't too great either. The only major difference I saw from the former Cadillac Ranch / Ranch House is that the mechanical bull was replaced by a small dance floor. \n\nAs mentioned in previous reviews, the staff is obliterated early on in the evening which makes it challenging to get a drink in under 15 minutes (after you place your order). Prepare to repeat your order several times. The DJ stopped the music periodically to insist all bars be filled with girls (both bartenders and patrons) who would then dance on the bar while the bartenders poured free \""shots\"" directly into patrons' mouths. The shots were in an unmarked bottle and were an odd purple color. Avoid the mystery bottle that just grazed the mouths of 30 other people.\n\nOverall, I understand the idea of a party bar but this one missed the mark. The bartenders had more of a party than any of the patrons. Long story short, spend your money anywhere else nearby for better service from staff sober enough to remember your order."
0,"It's no doubt your ratings are so low.  I was picking my husband up from work (in a gated residential community) Thursday night 6/13 when a silver jeep commando (with the Pizza Hut hat on its roof displaying the telephone number of (702) 253-9011) sped by me.  As we were driving out of the gates, the same silver jeep commando was riding our butt and then started beeping his horn at us WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE GATE TO OPEN!  I then called the 253-9011 number, was given the run around by the telephone answerer, I asked for a supervisor who advised their store does not deliver to 7885 W. Flamingo, he offered the telephone number of the store that would deliver to that address.  I dialed the number and got a recording that said they were closed.  I then called several other pizza hut stores asking if they delivered to 7885 W Flamingo, they all pointed me to the store I originally called.  I hope this review gets to a person with integrity & authority so action might be taken to avoid unsafe, impatient drivers possibly taking a life."
1,"I think this place is pretty great. It's your typical -- hole in the wall, beer, pool, darts, Golden Tee, jukebox, bar food, cheap drinks, friendly people, blue collar, mostly regulars, but still friendly to newbies -- kind of place. A great place to watch a game, even better for a Nascar race (CAUTION!!!).\n\nOne thing I love is that the bartenders cook the food right in front of you at the bar. That seemed a bit odd at first, but it turns out to be a great thing because you can be more involved in the preparation of your food and see exactly what they're doing. No guessing about what's actually happening in the kitchen. Some of them are really good cooks too; you might learn something. The drinks are dirt cheap, the staff is super friendly, and the drama is always low. Just sit down, drink a beer and make a friend. Simple as that.\n\nA quick note to the negative reviewers on this page: Your experience is not common. Every place has bad nights. Overall, this place is pretty great, especially if you're expecting a casual experience. I understand it's not for everybody, since it is a bit rough around the edges. I wouldn't bring a prom date here or anything. But if you're just looking to kick back and watch a game, it might be worth another shot."
1,"Just tried this place for the first time tonight and we really liked it! The staff was very friendly. We ordered an appetizer and they were out of part of what it came with usually, so they substituted it with something even better. We got the orange chicken and Sing High fried rice, both of which were very good. We will be back!"
1,"Since serve Strongbow (on tap), I am morally obligated to love them.  The burgers are great, although the wait to get a table can be endless.  What can I say - shove your way in and grab a stool at the bar and have your dinner there.  Feel free to mix and match condiments to your heart's content.  And save your dill pickle for me.  \r\nAddendum 1/25/06 - They've taken Strongbow off tap but still have it in \""man-cans\"" - good enough for me!"
0,"I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. \""I know, that is why we have Yelp!\""\n\nThis place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 \""so called\"" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. \n\nFirst of all, I love all my \""super burritos\"" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.\n\nI'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, \""I got ripped off.\"" The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  \n\nI ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.\n\nTo find a decent \""super\"" burrito in another city continues."

1,"Friendly staff (of they are from Pittsburgh!!!) After parking my car after I dropped it off, they pulled it back out of the garage and drove me to the Megabus pickup site at the Convention. Also the weekend rate $9.99/day was SO WORTH IT!!!"
1,"i'm pretty sure that this a chain, and i usually try to avoid fast food joints when i can, especially while on vacation. however, at 2:00 AM in the morning, anything open is fair game.\n\ni was hurting for something greasy to calm my inebriated self. i had eaten merely hours before, and i even told myself not to eat too much else i would be hurting tomorrow. \n\none medium size burger with chili [and a lot of stolen fries] later, i felt goooood. the burger reminded me of in-&-out. what probably gives it an interesting touch is the relish. not bad i guess.\n\nthis place even had live entertainment - drunk people causing commotion."
1,"I never really understood what the big deal was with crepes, but the Crepe Bar made a believer out of me. \n\nThe menu is basic, but that simplicity also makes it classic. There are three sweet crepes - nutella and bananas, cream and berries, and a house special of cr\u00e8me brulee. The savory crepes include a burrito and a few others (sorry, can't remember!). Husband and I ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte. As we waited for our food, we watched the burrito go by and decided we'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split. My latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top, delivered by a smiling employee. First sip - heavenly. (One of the better lattes I've had recently and I'm a coffee snob.) Quickly our crepes followed, looking beautiful on pristine, white plates. There were strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy, but definitely filling. Husband requested caramel be drizzled over his, adding a sweeter taste to his crepe. Crepe was light and airy, no crispy edges and just sweet enough. The cream and berries were definitely fresh.\n\nThe location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic. Committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food, it's gotta be good, right? Damn straight. The inside is a bit sparse, I don't remember any wall art, but there are plenty of tables and chairs. On the steel counter top, instead of a regular cash register, they use an iPad - which gives them cool techie cred. You can also see the chef at work, which is nice to see where the food comes from. \n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place to take your date, relatives, friends, maybe even strangers - just gather them all up and prepare for deliciousness."
0,"Let me start off by saying that I like Quizno's- I like their how their sandwiches are warm and the soup is always good. The chip selection could be better, but that is something that I could work around. I love how they have a pickle \""bar\"" that you can snack on pickles with your meal! I happen to really like pickles so this concept is great to me.\nI went to this Quizno's today and for the second time in a row (I went there a couple of weeks ago) the service was just bad. I specifically ask for no tomatoes when I order my sandwich. . I don't know if the \""front\"" people are not talking to the \""back\"" people but come on they are 5 feet away from one another.  I don't like tomatoes on a sandwich! The girl really started picking the tomatoes off my sandwich like she was irritated that I didn't want tomatoes. Then put my sandwich in the bag. Not only did this happen on this visit it happened last time as well. Is this Quizno's really in that bad of shape that they cannot make me a new sandwich? \nThe service at this Quizno's will prevent me from going back I will either go someplace else to eat or I will drive the extra five miles to a different Quizno's that will value me as a customer.\nSo today  before I can eat my sandwich I have to pick the remaining tomatoes out as there is still \""slime\"" and \""seeds\"" that cannot be removed... Good thing I am not allergic to tomatoes... that would not be good!"
0,"I have gone to this location for 6 years. Service has always been friendly and helpful. After reading a review I understand ownership changed.  The owners son was extremely arrogant without an ounce of customer service.  I showed up with just 2 shirts 5 minutes after closing (3:05).  The door was open and he was sitting there reading a book. I offered to write my name and number and leave the shirts on the counter to be processed Monday. He refused to accept the items. 2 others showed up behind me and he also refused their items too. The mother drove up and said she would take the items and he ran out screaming at his mother to leave and he stated he has plenty of other business and he was more than happy to say \""I am happy to lose you as a customer.  Come back Monday if you want your shirts done.\""  He accomplished his goal of losing me as a customer."
1,"Badass Decor.   Incredible Salsa.   Great service.   Good food.\n\nCOME ON!    This place was closest to my hotel but I almost skipped it for a taco bar place because of these reviews about the food and salsa.    Lucky for me we decided to try it.   And to the reviewer with 1 * who says CHICAGO is home of authentic mexican?    I laugh at you.   I suppose if you think Chicago is authentic Mexican, then your 1* actually makes sense  (yes, I've lived in Chicago)\n\nOld style bar (beautiful) and woodwork.   Cool patio.   Service prompt, thorough, often, and with a smile.    Huge spaces with tons of tables for large groups.\n\nSalsa: They bring you two types.   In mini-pitchers so you don't run out.   And they are both GREAT.    And thick.   And spicy.   And \""guaranteed authentic\"".\n\nFajitas were good.   Enchiladas were good.   Rice was good.   \nBased on the rest of my experience I would assume most things there were good.\n   \nThe Bad: \nNo Micheladas.   Flour tortillas seemed homemade, but something was off - I think we got older ones / stale - either make them fresh or change your recipe - something there needs a change."
1,"Beckett's continues to delight and amaze me. Favorites are still the grilled cheese and the short ribs, I would give my first born for the seasonal roasted vegetables.\n\nI never make reservations and always get a table within 15 minutes.

0,"The f****ing worst. Called them at 8am to schedule a pickup. They were nice on the phone and told me to call back in 10 min when I was ready to roll bc a driver might be there in 10 min, 30min the latest. I called back 10 min later (8:10) and ordered the cab. Sounded easy peasy. Was told to wait in the lobby and to wait for a call from the driver... as you can imagine, both the call and the cab NEVER CAME. So, I was forced to roam the streets looking for a cab at 9:10, an hour after booking a cab through this shite company. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT CALL lvcabs.com to book a cab, unless you really, really enjoy aimlessly hanging out in your lobby.\n\nUber... HURRY UP and get to Vegas already!"
1,Food is amazing. Wonderful vegetarian selection. I came here solely because of the huge vegetarian selection. So many choices I couldnt decide. The service was less than attentive but I think this is sort of a typical thing to expect at a restaurant in this genre. The food more than made of for the flighty service and short wait. The herbal salad had such an intense burst of flavor in every bite that I often had to pause and chew a few extra times to enjoy the bite. Cant wait to go back and try a few more vege dishes.
0,"We came to ride the gondolas, 4 of us. We were interested in riding the outside ones, so we asked an employee who was there greeting us as we walked in where we could purchase them. He directed us to a desk with 2 guys, who said they could sell them to us. \nCome to find out he was just trying to sell us show tickets and wasted an hour of our time. Once he realized we weren't  buying any show tickets, he told us where we could buy them. He also told us my daughter  was too young to ride, she is 2.5. Once we got outside, they said she could and we couldve bought the tickets out there in the 1st place. So we get on and the ride was nice, too short though. Same price as 1 of the pictures they try to sell you at the end. Then as we were about dock, our boatman mentions that tips are greatly appreciated.  I was going to tip, but felt kind of odd being asked to tip. I still did, but felt weird afterwards. Never again. Plus too, there is no buffet here, and if there is I couldnt find it. Felt like I was at a car lot and just got suckered. Employees here just felt too pushy, like those people in the mall. And they didn't have their information right. Nice hotel, but the customer service is terrible!"
1,"Great experience. Great shop. Great people. Brandy gave me an awesome blow out, such a pleasant atmosphere! 35 bucks was well worth it!"
0,I visited Wing Stop again after 9 months or so. It was as good as I remembered only less so as in it wasn't that good last time and was less good this time I tried the Cajun sauce and I don't really know what it is supposed to be but it was kind of hot and kind of buffalo sauce and kind of jerk-herby and hard to pin down like this sentence it was a little aimless in it's flavor and just didn't do much for me so this was probably my last visit to Wing Stop.  Yup.
0,Beer: good\nThere's surely a beer for anyone who like beer on the menu. Nothing wow but decent.\nFood: average to underwhelming\nThey play it safe with the menu and the flavor. Its over sauced and yet still bland.\nService: hit and miss\nWe were treated well enough but it wasn't clear to us or the staff who was waiting our table... it took some time to get sorted.
0,"Very disappointed with this particular DQ location. My boyfriend ordered an ice cream cake for my birthday as a surprise. He ordered the cake two days prior to needing it (although this location claims they only need 24 hours notice). He clearly explained to the employee that he needed the cake promptly when they opened at 10am to which she replied that would be no problem. When he went in to pick up the cake at 10:15am, it was not ready. The employees claimed that the top of the cake had not been finished, however we later realized that the cake hadn't even been made at all yet. They informed him they needed an extra 30 minutes to an hour to complete it. Two hours later, we came back to DQ to pick up the cake. It looked absolutely atrocious. It was obvious that the cake was rushed to be made as it was not frozen and the icing work was incredibly sloppy. At this point, my boyfriend was very frustrated and asked for a manager. After much conversation, the manager went to the back of the store to speak with either another manager or the owner of this franchised location. He then begrudgingly offered to take the cake back and refund the money or take $5 off the price. My boyfriend decided to take the $5 off, however looking back, we wished we would have given the cake back and taken the refund. I also found that offer quite strange because I am not sure what they would do with an already decorated cake. Regardless, these cakes are quite expensive and should always be made properly and on time. The owner of this location should be embarrassed they are selling such a poor product.\n\nOverall, this was an extremely poor experience and we will never order another cake from this location. If you are looking to order a cake, consider the Windmill location as we ordered one from there previously and it was made perfectly."
0,VERY disappointed. No ambiance. Ugly patio. Rude staff. The website menu shows a gluten free option but when I asked about it they seemed irritated. Food isn't great. Wine pours are small. This neighborhood needed a new restaurant/bar but this one isn't going to cut it.

0,"PROTIP: Never talk down to customers, you don't know if they Yelp. =)\n\nRecently, a friend and I made a stop here to purchase a modest amount of alcohol. Business as usual--until we were forced to wait at checkout for about five minutes. After losing my patience, I observed what was happening. The cashier had taken our IDs to two other clerks, who inspected them thoroughly. Keep in mind that my card is genuine, valid, and with a small amount of wear. The lamination is intact, and all information is legible.\n\nIt is good enough for dozens of bars, liquor stores (including chains such as Total Wine), and every other grocery store I have been to...so why such scrutiny now? Our clueless clerk, who seemed just a bit too eager and upbeat to address or inconvenience, was more than happy to answer with a smile.\n\n\""Okay, we were concerned about these IDs being fake\"", she explained, citing an incident from earlier that day. \""We had to decide whether or not to accept these\"". Her concern felt rather malevolent. As she reluctantly allowed me to finish my transaction, she had some final words as I took my receipt.\n\n\""ESPECIALLY yours. We almost denied it. You really need a new one.\""\n\nHad I not been with friends and had places to be, I would have asked to speak with a manager about such disappointing customer service. Clearly, they were the mistaken ones in regard to the validity of my ID. Would it not make sense to...apologize for being wrong and holding me up? At the very least, she could have briefly explained their policy on verifying age. Otherwise, it feels very accusatory and arbitrary. Minus one star for the hold up, one for having a meager selection compared to other Fry's, and minus infinity stars for condescending clerks that try to lecture me. I'll try my best to avoid this location."
1,"I'm very glad this Super Target is so close to my house. It is a great store for just about anything. It's very big, well stocked, and clean. The grocery is pretty awesome. I usually buy my groceries right down the street at Fry's Marketplace but it's nice to be able to stop here on the way home to pick up any last second items for meal planning.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and helpful. Sometimes it's hard to find somebody on the floor if you have questions or need to find something.\n\nI don't drink coffee but there's a Starbucks here also. It's a nice sit in coffee shop within the store. Pretty cool for the Joeys."
0,"Overpriced, tiny portions. sigh. My friends said that they loved the HH specials... so maybe I'd suggest giving that a try. The service was pretty awesome, but sadly, the food couldn't deliver. Just expect to spend a lot of money for sub-par food."
0,"I had a coupon from the RetailMeNot app, buy one entree, get one of equal or lesser value free up to $9, if you buy 2 beverages, yadda yadda. Only reason we chose to go to ihop for a late dinner. My husband ordered the recommendation from our server, banana waffle, and also got eggs and bacon. He asked for medium well eggs, and mentioned they usually come out too runny, to which our server said she would 'make sure they are more medium well'. Needless to say, they were barely cooked enough to hold their shape, hardly any coloring from being cooked and my husband couldn't eat them. The waffle wasn't that great either. I ordered the SW Club. Super dry!  Once the check came and I showed my coupon, the server left to check with her manager and came back and said they are no longer accepting offers on phones, they have to be a print out. There is nothing on the offer that says this and there isnt even an option to print through the app. I guess they can get away with this because of the fine print that says the offer is subject to change withput notice. Our server was friendly, otherwise it was not a good dining experience, even for an ihop."
0,"Had a terrible experience.  Went for breakfast.  It was crowded.  There a boy acting as host and cashier.  He said he would clear me off a table.  After being gone for a few minutes, I could see he still hadn't cleared the table.  After several more minutes, he asked me to go stand by the dirty table until they cleared it!  I was confused as to why he asked me to stand in the middle of a crowded restaurant staring at a dirty table.  A waitress pointed to  another table, which was clean.  After sitting there for several minutes, I asked to be moved because the location was right by the kitchen and it was very noisy and the wait staff had to maneuver around me.  The two top was finally clean, and I moved there.  I finally placed my order.  The waitress was not at all friendly.  Once she brought out plates for another table and dumped them on my table until she could distribute them to the table next to me.  She filled my coffee once without a word, and dripped coffee all over my newspaper. When she brought my food, she slapped it and the check down without a word.  Never came back to check on me.    Food was decent, just normal.  I didn't like that they put the jellies on the same basket with the toast, seemed unsanitary.  When waiting to pay, the waitress caught my eye for the first time.  I think she had already seen my measly tip I had left and was unhappy.  Not a friendly little restaurant in my eyes!"
0,terrible cocktails. didn't eat.
1,"First, you got to like beer to enjoy this. Actually, you should really love beer. Luckily, my hubby and I do. A lot. I wouldn't go here for a cocktail, wine or a bud. Go here to try a beer you've never heard of before at a good price along with a decent snack. \n\nI tried a local brewery called Hess - a wonderful Russian Imperial stout. Then I had a Belgian flight of 4 beers for $10. The Ovila Brandy Barrel Aged Stout was soooo yummy and my hubby even liked it and he's not a fan of stouts. The only downside is it was a limited run so I can't find it anywhere else. \n\nOne caveat - this place is tiny and loud. We sat outside, which helped, but there were a couple very obnoxious, loud drunk people out on the patio. \n\nThe pretzel was delicious - huge and hanging from a banana stand. Very different. And where else in the east valley can you get a scotch egg? \n5 beers down, 75 to go..."

0,"Went to Umi last night, and it was tough to get a reservation, which is usually a good sign. But actually, in retrospect, its just a sign that people are not aware of the quality of sushi that can be found elsewhere in Pittsburgh. It was sad, really.\nWe began with the miso soup, which was some of the\nbest we have had. Nice and hot, and perfectly seasoned. But it was downhill from there.\nThe salad was just ok. Mixed greens were wilted, but the dressing was tasty.\nWe then moved on to the \""good stuff,\"" or so we thought...\nWe began with the highly-recommended \""yellowtail sashimi with yuzu jalape\u00f1o sauce\"" -- it was overly ceviche'd, and lost its freshness, replaced by a tough, dried-out quality. While a small sliver of jalapeno was a nice touch for sharpness, it didn't compensate for the poor quality preparation of the fish itself. We next had a spicy tuna roll (which, I think, is a barometer for sushi quality in any restaurant). It was dry and average, at best. Nothing special, but no egregious mistakes either. We moved on to the \""sushi entree (assorted)\"", which had 8 pieces of assorted sushi, each consisting of a piece of fish: yellowtail prepared exactly like the previous dish but with rice this time; two pieces of salmon topped with (of all things) cream cheese and a cherry tomato (come on, this was so disappointingly reminiscent of brunch -- where's the caper and english muffin?; mackarel which was less-than-tasty, again topped with a dollup of something indistinct and non-complementary; tuna (average); red snapper maybe; and a paper-thin piece of mild whitefish, which tasted like rice, owing to its diminutive portioning; and a tuna maki roll, which was dry and shriveled and appeared limp, like it was prepared earlier that day.\nI was expecting an artful presentation, but was shocked at the lack of playful creativity that I, at that point, assumed might account for the inflated prices compared to other restaurants in the area (since the quality of flavor was actually MUCH poorer than other local places).\nNext to us was seated a couple on a date, where the man was clearly trying to impress his lady (both dressed very nicely and timidly fascinated by each other's every word and expression). I felt sorry for him, because he was either going to be disappointed with the meal itself, or oblivious to the fresh japanese seafood delights he could be exposing her to just a short drive away. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO TAKE YOUR LOVE INTEREST, unless she is impressed simply by the magnitude of a check and a mere patina of fine dining.\nOur waitress was sweet, patient, and knowledgeable, and I couldn't help but wonder if she would recommend Umi to her family. I doubt it.\nWe concluded with a dessert that was simply delicious, playful and contemporary -- and weren't surprised to find that the desserts are actually part of the menu of their \""sister-restaurant,\"" Soba (which is a WONDERFUL place). It was the Soba Banana Split - an unusual and tantalizing update of the original (which, I believe, was originally invented in Pittsburgh).\nOverall, the portions were small and unsatisfying, which would've been ok if the flavors were outstanding, but they were not. Not at all! I was shocked, and realized that a restaurant that should be credited with exposing the local eaters to fine Japanese cuisine years ago, has fallen from its lofty perch atop Pittsburgh's international dining choices. And fallen far.\nSo insular a chef can become when his cuisine is lauded for so long, that he can become ignorant of the ever-rising quality of his competition. I suggest Umi's chefs explore other restaurants and realize that they no longer have a monopoly on daily freshness, and that their creativity, like their salad, has become stale.\nTo people seeking high-quality sushi in the area, I must strongly recommend Ichiban (in Aspinwall), and before you question my credibility in recommending a restaurant nestled in a strip mall, think about what makes sushi wonderful. If unwavering freshness, playful inventiveness and sense of fun mixed with elegant presentation and even nice wine pairings, exactness in execution and preparation, thoughtful proportions as well as portions are qualities that not only enhance experience but even define Japanese cuisine, then Ichiban gets it right. Umi, I'm afraid, is way past its prime.\nIt's not that Umi is so bad. It's just not that good. Nothing special.\nI can say I have tried several other places in Pittsburgh, trying to find a suitable place to satisfy my frequent cravings for fresh raw seafood with a characteristically Japanese seriousness in its execution and levity of presentation and flavor combinations. Ichiban is the place that is consistently able to capture this \""essence\"" of Japanese cuisine. But there are others that are also better than Umi, which should no longer, by any means, be considered a standard."
1,"Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good."
0,"Spent 4 nights there for a convention, the exterior, the casino the lobby, absolutely beautiful.  The concierge and the staff are a dream- completely dedicated to your experience.  However when you get to the room in the palace tower its a little downhill.  First thing is unmopped floors and sinks that have not been wiped down for some time.  Open the cabinet door to the mini bar- it comes off in your hand.  On the second day there, a large piece of wood that was covering the pipes on the sink fell off and got my foot (ouch) I quick phone call to the desk promised a speedy repair but we saw no such thing - left 3 days later having had to step around a large board in the bathroom.  Down the hall to purchase a water from the vending machine rewarded me with a machine that took my money and rewarded me with gushing ice cold  water from the bottom of the machine and over my feet.  That didnt ever get mopped up either.  So, in the future I will mostly likely visit the good parts of Caeser and stay clear of the housekeeping nightmares by staying elswhere.  Its a real shame - if housekeeping could rise to that standard the rest of the staff had I would stay there every time......."

0,"Don't eat here!!! Waited in line with 10 other people for 30 minutes even though there were a dozen open tables. We concluded they were trying to get a line going to draw attention to the place. The food was not good, basically Hometwon Buffet style. To too it off I got food poisoning, probably from the sushi. The only redeeming quality is if you drink they have free alcohol. I would strongly warn people against eating here."
0,"I usually go the the cafe rio on eastern and serene and this is my first time eating at this location.  I have to say it will be the last time.  I would rather drive further for better service, cleanliness, and food quality.  This location is terrible.  The staff were very rude.  They were dropping things everywhere.  The lettuce looked old and wilted.  Half of the drinks on the drink station were empty and we were there at 5:30pm.  It also looked like the they haven't cleaned the whole station for days.  I hope they either retrain their staff or hire better people."
1,"One of my favorite sushi places in az. I'm from California so my sushi standards are high and while there is no comparison to Cali sushi, this is a close second. Ive tried about 6 sushi places in az and been dissapointed and felt totally ripped off but ra has some great deals and quality for your money. \n\nMy favorite is the seared tuna with a sweet onion sauce and their salmon roll with asparagus. Everything is fresh and fast. The bartender Eric ALWAYS takes great care of us and always has some entertaining and morally objective stories to keep us entertained. \n\nThey USED to have a great happy hour menu but they changed it and I am not impressed . I haven't been back for hh since the change and I hope they revert to the original hh menu. \n\nOne nice touch is they are good about pouring your beer/saki in a nice cold/hot glass and refilling it as it goes down. Its the little touches that matter!"
1,"I took my niece and nephew here.  I was a little worried about the location and that it would be not as nice as the pictures on the website made it look.  However I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a nice little amusement park located within a large park.  It's free admission, but you pay for the rides.  We got wristbands for the kids as well as one for me, since my niece could not ride everything alone due to her height.\n\nThe kids had a blast going back and fourth from ride to ride.  Their two favorites were the \""Dumbo\"" style airplanes and the \""Merry-Go-Round\"" style cars (located next to each other).  The other favorite of the day was the train ride.  It was a nice long ride (at least 5 minutes, maybe more) that takes you through the adjoining park.  My nephew loves trains which was part of the reason we went here, and he was not disappointed.  The Carousel also had 2 small stationary horses which the kids enjoyed (they usually choose to sit on benches instead of the up and down horses). \n\nEnchanted Island is definitely for younger kids, since there are maximum height restrictions on almost every ride.  It was reasonably priced for a day of fun for the kids.  They even have annual passes available that seemed like a good deal if you live nearby.\n\nTIP: Sign up for their email and you get a Buy 1 Get 1 Free Kids unlimited wristband coupon."
1,"The hot crab legs are to die for! So delicious!!! \n\nCame here on a Wednesday night around 8pm. No line (thank goodness)! Last time we came, the line was wrapped around, and the wait was about 2 hours! The cost was about $50/ person. I thought that was pretty reasonable considering the amount of variety there was. In Hawaii, you'll easily pay $50 for a buffet that doesn't have half the choices of food. Our waiter was very friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our meal here."
0,"My wife and I, whom live in Grayhawk, visited the Local Bistro last night.  We ordered the Caprese Salad, Beef Carpaccio, Steak Frites, and a Chicken Parmesan Cobb Salad.  Once we placed our order we were notified that the Caprese Salad was sold out.\n\n**If you like thick, chewy roast beef, get the Beef Carpaccio.  I can't say enough bad things about it.\n\n**If you want even chewier meat that is impossible to swallow, get the Steak Frites.\n\n**If you want an unpalatable Chicken Parmesan Cobb Salad, this is definitely the place to go.\n\nTo further my anguish, Local Bistro does not have toothpicks, so you can't even get the chewy meat out of your teeth.\n\nThere were a few good points to the restaurant, the wait staff seemed friendly and the inside of the restaurant is clean and neat.\n\nUnfortunately for Local Bistro, my $51.00 check was way over priced.  I don't mind paying a pretty penny for good food, but being that I chose not to eat my entire meal, I left hungry.  I feel that Local Bistro will have the same future as Eddie Chan's (who had way better food) which was the last restaurant that occupied that space.\n\nIf you feel like spending $50 on a meal for two people without drinks, there are many better options within a mile radius."
0,"Perhaps it was an off night, but we were really disappointed in our take-out. My husband's pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don't know what it was. His Gen. Tso's chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. In the past it has been good food."
0,"If you are old enough to remember Checkpoint Charley, the Eastern Bloc and Willy Brandt you will be familiar with the look and feel of the Aria Cafe. \n\nThe starkness and monochromatic palette of the place made me feel that I was eating my Chinese Chicken Salad (or other communist approved food) in an East German government building during the early days of the cold war. There is very little decoration, color or even signs that the space was meant to be inhabited by actual human beings.\n\nWith no sound-absorbing surfaces (a pet peeve of mine) the place had a hollow, utilitarian feel and was amazingly loud and reverberant for such an open space.\n\nI will say the dour, mechanistic look is a pallet cleansing contrast to the life, energy and mayhem of the strip outside but perhaps just a hint of color...or warmth...or humanity would be welcome.\n\nOn the bright side (and most things will seem bright next to the Schutzwall grey-green used here) the food was very good and the service was provided, not as you might expect by burly East German waitresses but by warm friendly folks who seemed to enjoy their jobs. (Unlike some reviewers I had no issue with service but I was not in any hurry)\n\nAll in all I'm not sure whether to recommend the restaurant; As an historical experience it really brought the past to life, (I could almost hear the sound of clacsons in the distance) as a dining experience... when you come to Vegas you can certainly do better."

Luckily, the first stop was our hotel--The Venetian.\nI bought a round trip ticket but waiting for the pick-up at the hotel to return to the airport was very stressful.  They were 45 minutes late and we almost missed our flight.  We called 4 times to ask where the shuttle was and the answer was always the same--\""it's 5 minutes away\"".  Other people on the shuttle later told us that they were at the Palazzo sitting in the shuttle for 1/2 an hour before they finally left to pick us up at The Venetian. (they are neighboring casinos). Again, they waited until the shuttle was full with no regard to the agreed upon pick -up time for us.\nIt's just not worth it.  The money you might have saved would have been better spent on a more reliable service.  You're in Las Vegas for god's sake--you're going to spend money anyway.\nLesson learned.  If you are not in a hurry, then this might be a good option as it only cost $12.00 round trip per person."
1,"I brought a picture of the ring I wanted to Paul and his team and they were very excited to help me make this dream a reality.  They worked with my budget and provided pictures of the progress along the way.\n\nPaul and his team were incredibly courteous and professional, they provided top notch customer service and were happy to help explain things to me since I do not know anything about jewelry or diamonds.\n\nI am looking forward to going back to work with them again on wedding bands.\n\nMake sure to visit Paul at Barnes Fine Jewelers for top of the line service and quality when it comes to jewelry design."
0,I've called this place for two months. Never a single answer. I stopped by a few times and they are always closed. Don't waste your time. They are no longer in business. They must not have been that good after all.
0,Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay.
1,"I've stayed here a few times, despite being a local. Most recently I stayed here for 6 days, my stay was nice and quiet. Service was great and I was able to rent a small fridge for water and the like. I was impressed at the availability of convenience items available at the desk including Advil an such. Overall I was pleased with my stay and will stay again."
0,"You know it hurts me to even say this because a lot of my friends like this place and that's why I came.  We weren't greeted at all just told to sit wherever... not a smile was cracked in our server's face... also... I ordered 4 each of their daily selection which they only had 3 regional oysters to choose from besides their house... I was given a dozen on their HOUSE oysters but she \""allowed\"" me to have 6 oysters of what I wanted and ordered... I paid for the dozen that I didn't order and only ate half of it... WEIRD, it should have been the other way around... The sausages need SEASONING bad... it was OK... I had to ask her if we could order our dinner after she walked off with the menu and never came back.  And I like this neighborhood... but poor experience...."
1,"I stopped by here during some night of the most recent Vegas trip, why can't I remember which night?! We probably got tired of Jet and decided to leave early. Our plan was to meet a couple friends at Venetian but Jon K and I were hungry so we decided to grab some noodles for a late night snack! \n\nIt took a few moments before anyone could help us or point us to a table, but it was pretty late so it's understandable. Our waiter came by with our menus immediately, he was also immediately ready to take our order! Way too fast, dude! Boyfriend & I shared the Szechuan Beef noodle soup, and our friend ordered the wonton noodle soup I think. He really liked his soup, and ours was delicious!! I was kinda worried bc it was supposed to be spicy, but it was just right! It warmed me up without making me reach for everyone's ice water! The beef was also super tender, yummy! \n\nPrice was a lil high, but hey, it's in the Venetian! And it wasn't anything more than you'd find at a pricey Asian place in any other city, so overall not too shabby! Definitely great for late night snack, it isn't too crowded and your food comes out pretty quick!"
0,"Our first visit to Remington's was on a recent weeknight.  We made reservations but they certainly were not needed as the dining room was nearly empty.  By contrast the bar lounge area was rather busy.  A piano and lounge singer could be heard into the dining room, kind of a nice background that we did enjoy.  Others have raved about this being a classy place.  I sure didn't get that vibe.  It was more 80's dated hotel restaurant than classy to me.\n\nWe had a very attentive waiter who served us well.  There seemed to be a lot of servers with a lot of busy acitivty, constantly in and out of swinging doors.  There was a large group in a private closed off dining area.  We noticed most patrons were in their Senior years.  Maybe they alternate between here and Charleston's?\n\nBetween us we ordered steak & grilled salmon with a potato dish to share and a couple of side salads.  The steak was not cooked as requested but we didn't bother to send it back.  Salmon was unremarkable.  The tomato mozzarella salad was abundant but yellow tomatoes were inedible mush and the red tomatoes were just flavorless.  Lyonnaise potatoes were a tad greasy.  Dinners are all ala carte.  Nothing was particularly bad, just nothing to get excited about.  I felt like I was dining in a hotel restaurant, food was delivered with plastic covers like they use in room service dining.  \n\nOverall I have to say I was simply underwhelmed.  After reading other reviews I had greater expectations for Remington's.  At a total of $84 (no alcohol) we expected more.  If I were a hotel guest on an expense account, maybe I would have felt differently. For the money, next time I would drive just down the street and go to Ruth's Chris.  We won't be hurrying back to Remington's."
0,"We stayed at \""The Fitz\"" this past weekend, but only for one night (which was our reservation through hotels.com).  Our room was upgraded from a regular room to a suite (but I think it's because we checked in late and they probably gave away our reserved room.  The room was large, but a bit outdated.  Eh..whatever.  We didn't come to Vegas for our room.\n\nWhile the price was good, there are several reasons we won't stay here again.\n1. The parking situation is a WRECK.  There was no parking in their entire garage so you had to valet you car.  \n2. Some of the people who stay here are sketchy (please don't tell me about sketchy people in Vegas...I used to live here!).  Someone needs to put up a sign in the elevator that says NO SMOKING- for real.  Someone was actually smoking in the elevator.\n3. The location is at the north end of the strip...I mean, ALL THE WAY north.\n4. The casino is small (that's ok by us since we didn't gamble) but what that means is all the smoke is confined to one area.  You simply can't walk through the casino without smelling like a cigarette.  It's just not possible.\n\nI found the staff to be ok- nothing great, nothing special...but then again, we really didn't interact with them.  Valet was quick with our cars, even during prime check-out time.  We had no problem with the elevators and we were on the 28th floor.  Maybe that issue has been resolved?\n\nWe wouldn't stay here again simply due to the location."
0,Sadly I had a two star experience here last night so needed to update. Had horribly salty dish and was unimpressed by the overall experience. Even the good is sometimes horribly bad I guess....
1,"The food here is good, but overpriced.\n\nCLEANLINESS: 4/5\nSERVICE: 3/5\nFOOD: 4/5\n- ABC (Avocado, Brie, Caramalized Onions) Burger\n- Frozen Hot Chocolate\n\nI don't remember why this place was famous, but supposedly it's in a movie or something and the original one is in New York. The decor is really girly and circus-like. Our party decided to sit outside, but that was probably a wrong move because it was hella windy. Luckily they had some heaters on, so that made it somewhat better. \n\nOur waitress was alright. She didn't seem very personable or present. She was barely around, and there weren't even a lot of customers outside. However this other guy with curly hair was also waiting tables nearby, and eventually helped us whenever we needed something. Thank you curly hair man. The supervisor or whoever that blond lady was, seemed really angry and mean. Please take that negativity behind the doors and away from the customers. I hate hearing employees getting scolded right next to any customer in a restaurant... it makes things so awkward.\n\nNow for the food! The ABC Burger was pretty damn good. It was kinda hard to bite because it was stacked up high. It was kind of small, but enough for me. The burger came with these awesome sweet potato fries. My definite favorite. I asked for some honey mustard, which made it even more bomb. The meat was cooked correctly and was full of flavor. For dessert, I got the frozen hot chocolate which was alright. Nothing out of this world. \n\nWould I come here again? Probably, just because it's Vegas and those sweet potato fries are always a win for me. Too bad the menu is overpriced!"
0,"When I went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf. Remembrance of the stomach bile stink still haunts me whenever I think of or pass by this eyesore. It was so strong I couldn't talk, listen or even think. I could hardly choke down the swill and nod to whatever crap music was playing or in rough acknowledgment of what I thought someone else was saying. WHAT DID SHE SAY? THIS PLAY DUCKLING BUCKS? Its pretty loud. \n\nNeedless to say it was also too crowded, dark and dirty. I realize that I am not exactly in their target market, being over 21 and all, but this place is just horrifically bad. Those that characterize this bar as anything but an unmitigated crap-dungeon are either lying to themselves or have never been to a decent bar."
0,"Everyone has been talking about this place ever since I moved here 10 years ago. I finally gave in and went to Famous Dave's for dinner! I have to say it was okay, nothing impressive. Don't understand why everyone swears it the best. If the price was a little more fair for what they serve, then I would say its a pretty decent joint. Overall, i left disappointed. Enough said."
0,"Bad... not worth giving a review, but here's the heads up and your warning"
1,I enjoy making and watching other people trying to stack pounds of stuff on the bowls trying to get their moneys worth:) the food is always good and service is pretty smooth. the first two times the messed up my rice but were quick to offer to fix it.
1,"Craving some sort of shake or mocha thing, went through the drive through alleyway and the New Smores Shake stuck out like a sore thumb. Got the medium for $3.39 and it was a very large shake with straw and spoon and whipped cream and choc. syrup involved. The graham crackers and marshmallows were in shake form with choc. ice cream and I mostly used the spoon to devour the thing at home. Very good treat once in awhile and it's probably a limited item, so get it now."
1,"I have always heard bad things about Ra so I never wanted to make it a place to dine for sushi... I do think that most negative comments were referring to the location in Scottsdale if that makes any difference.  So what brought me to Ra was a team dinner with my coworkers.  The drinks I had were a little sweet than I usually like, but still good.  We were sat right away and the service was attentive... everything I had sushi wise was very good.  I enjoyed this much more than what I had at Kobe Japanese Steakhouse & Tepan & Sushi.  I would agree with other reviewers that the music is really loud and kind of out of place for a sushi restaurant.  In fact when we first arrived the music was at a normal level and then at some point they really cranked it up so then you kind of had to shout at the people in your party.  Other than that I really enjoyed the sushi and would come back for lunch since my office is close."
1,I have been to Spoon several times.  There are few things to say about it since everything is great here. Atmosphere and food+service quality.  They bring out some nice bread too with your meal.  Personal suggestion: duo of pork! Amazing.
0,"AJs sure is fine about messing up orders. We couldn't do a home cooked thanksgiving meal at our house because our oven was broken so we had AJs cater it. We explained to a Miss Teresa that we needed a cooked meal and she said she understood. We went to pick it up and we get cold uncooked dishes and a vacuum sealed turkey. We called AJs and the manager said that they couldn't get ahold of her so the best they could do is have us drive the food all the way back to the store to cook it with our hungry guests waiting at our house. The worst part is, the manager was very unapologetic about it. Thank you AJs for your lack of competence and poor customer service. Happy thanksgiving."
1,"Decided to try this place out last night after continuing to hear about it. One word describes it for me \""Excellent\"". The food was absolutely fantastic. We ordered the burger, fries, short rib taco, and the chicken taco and one of those delicious shakes. Can't complain about any of those items. The tacos really put it over the top for me. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and everybody is super nice. The decor is a mix between modern and old school burger joint. Absolutely great place! This will definitely be a spot we visit frequently."
1,"Great place for fun,food,drink and entertainment and the prices are reasonable. They provide a free shuttle service. Lots of TV's for all games even on Sunday NFL. Outside fire pit  when chilly outside with misters when it's hot. This is a sports bar not a fancy restaurant but the food is good and they always have specials on food and drink plus a reverse happy hour.Management keeps this place clean and neat with great help from staff and servers."
1,"I have never been disappointed when I eat at Roy's. The menu has pretty much been the same for years, as it should be, because it's perfect. If you have food allergies, they are probably the most accommodating of any place I've ever been to, which makes it all the more worth it. They have a huge drink menu as well, but the 1988 Martini is fantastic. Sit out on the patio if the weather's nice, it's very relaxing. \nThe appetizer canoe is the best way to start the meal: the Szechwan ribs, lobster pot stickers (from what I remember before I found out that I'm gluten intolerant) and the seared ahi are all awesome. From the entrees I've had over the years, I can say that they are all delightful. The sauces are what really make the dishes stand out, which is probably why Roy's is known for having really great sauces that compliment the dishes well. The molten hot chocolate souffle is to die for though. My family goes to Roy's only once a year for my parents' anniversary, and that souffle is what I look forward to all year. I just had it on Friday, and I already want another one. \nThe service is great too. Our waiter was very attentive to us and we had a great time."
0,"I have been a stylist for quite a few years now and have a few friends who rent from this location and a couple others. The places are pretty and decorated nice, but the drama prohibited me from leasing....the owner is sleazy and dates his tenants. He has one of them pregnant too. My husband said NO WAY."
0,"We came here to get a lil snack in since we had late dinner reservations.\n\nIt wasn't anything special, your typical bar type food.  I did enjoy the cocktail we got though. legally blonde, nice fruity frozen drink.\n\nThe waiter was really nice and attentive.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers Nachos, Sliders, Potato Skins.  \n\nThere wasn't anything special about these, just typical bar food.  If you were going for more experience if you are visiting, I would recommend elsewhere."
1,Food was very tasty. I recommend the red velvet pancakes. The wait staff was great. Only down side is price just like everything in Vegas.
1,Good chorizo. Not a fan of the salsa they bring out or the yellow cheesethey sprinkle on the dishes but everything else is good.
1,"I've always loved this place and used to come here a lot more frequently 10 years ago. The other day I came back for the wings I love. The price went up to $6 a dozen for happy hour, but they're worth it. Generous helping on the ranch for the carrots and celery and presentation is nice. Some of the same familiar faces still work there - some of the gals are still there (\""Very few people leave.\""). Of course Phil, perhaps the best bartender in the valley, is still there (he even remembered part of my weird drink I used to get!!), and Dave is showing some age now (sorry Dave, still love ya), and the comfort level is alive and well. At least until it gets crowded. However the staff knows how to BUST ASS, they've dealt with crowds for years. Gavin is no longer there, but he can be found lurking sometimes in other places in Tempe. \n\nThe patio is still great and the top floor is still haunted.\nNo thumping music.\nSo come on back!\n\nINSIDE SKINNY:  Get there early for Happy Hour, especially on Friday. If you arrive Friday 6pm the place is packed and you probably won't find parking or a free table, but there's the small lot directly next to Casey's on 9th that services the little apartments you can park in. Painted signs abound - \""We love Casey Moore's, parking allowed.\"" Hopefully you're not the first one in your group to arrive at 6pm."
0,"Worst fillet mignon I've ever had!! Medium does not mean charred and dry!! The soup of the day was alright, but nothing to write home about. Not going back."
1,"YUM! YUM! YUM!! Cornish Pasty is an awesome place!!! Most of the seating is large community tables and there is a very warm, welcoming vibe to the whole place!! They have a great selection of beers and the food was AMAZING!!! Very authentic and so delicious!! \n\nThis will definitely become a MUST GO place for me anytime I visit AZ!!!"
0,"Been coming to cafe rio for awesome fast Mexican food for years. Lived in Utah for a while...just like you Camilla k. I loved the ones in Utah and thought I would give this one a chance. The manager guy, don't know his name, is a total jerk. The food wasn't even warm. It was cold. My wife and I are sitting here right now and I'm so upset that I have to leave this review right now. Just awful service and not even good food anymore. Gradually getting worse. I'm going to costa vida from now on."
0,"If i could give 0 stars i would.  Absolutely the worst internet/cable provider ever.  Additional charges, 10-45 minute waits to speak with a customer service representative, often getting hung up on.  Lying sales people who don't tell you their special offer was only for a limited time then receiving bills for 4x what you were quoted.  And each time you can never get a hold of customer service representative, but if you hit the button for new or upgraded service you are immediately connected to someone, who apologizes that they can't help with your problems and puts you on hold only to be hung up on."
1,"Delightful!  2 pieces of pizza and drink for $4 AND its delicious!  The crust is light and thin, flavors are terrific.  Give this place a try!"
0,"The family and I had the worst experience ever. I was there on 3/26/2014. The rooms are not as clean, and customer service is rude. The valet parking sucks they have you waiting for 1/2 an hour. The food was horrible. NEVER EVER GOING BACK! The only reason I reserved this hotel was for my kids to go on the rides. Also, because my friend told me it was good for the price! Yah rite!"
0,"I was really excited to try Chez Vous.  My parents saw it featured on a AZ food show, so off we went for a weekend lunch.  I was not impressed.  Maybe it was an off day.  The service was nice, very Parisian, but it was a bit pushy.  The older woman who waited on us had so much perfume on that every time she came to the table I was overcome with the smell of it.  Not appetizing.  She was nice, but it was just too much.  I'm very sensitive to perfume, so too bad.\n\nAnother thing I didn't care for was that they were busing the table in the hallway near the bathrooms.  Dropping all the dishes in a tub.  It was really loud.  Just tossing plates and silverware in there made a tone of noise.  Really unappealing.  \n\nHonestly I was not impressed with their crepes and neither were my parents.  I had some chicken creme thing, and it was bland to me.  Very boring.  We had a dessert crepe, and it was rubbery.  I just don't get the hype.  I think Crepe Bar does a better job with crepes, theirs are outstanding."
0,"After the great reviews I expected something... good. Instead I was completely underwhelmed. So-so to gross ingredients, edible but barely. Will not be going back here."
1,We had a group of 6. Food was on point. Couple guys got the sandwich of the day. I got their burger. Everyone loved it. Decor is very unique and and the music they were playing was great. We will Go back for brunch most likely
1,"This is by far the best Air Conditioning people I've ever encountered. Their pricing was extremely fair. All work was installed quickly and without a glitch. They responded quickly on my first unit repair, so I gave them a chance when I finally bought a new one. They will be my air-conditioning people for as long as I live in Mesa, Arizona."
1,"I love going to AZ88 to hang out, have a cocktail, and people watch.  AZ88 is tres chic with changing art displays and live dj. I especially enjoy sitting on the patio decked out with modern white furniture overlooking SMOCA. \n\nFood and drinks are good too. Their menu consists of salads, burgers, sandwiches. The dishes are about $8 - $10 and the servings are pretty large. The cocktails are great but pricey...completely worth it! Try their martini or mojito."
1,"Came here during new years. It was a lot of fun! The bouncer let us in for free while others were having to pay. Come here with a favorable girl to guy ratio. good music,  well dressed crowd, friendly staff, pricey drinks and great view of the strip."
1,"Love the handmade tortillas!  So scrumptious.\n\nThe queso is awesome, but severely overpriced ($4?  Come on).\n\nUsually always get the shrimp fajitas to share; only tried a menu item once, and it was good.\n\nLove it here; just not a fan of walking out smelling like grilled onions."
1,"Came in with a few friends for a little late night dining.  It was my first time and I've heard quite a bit about this place and it didn't disappoint.  The prices blew my mind, I didn't know it was that inexpensive.    \n\nWhat impresses me the most are the condiments.  The kimchee and other vegetables are really fresh and go well with the good meats.  The meats were seasoned well and when eaten with the condiments, can't be beat.  Will definitely come back."
0,"I used to enjoy coming here. But man, what happened? Did management change, because everything was awful. The host was rude. Our server Brian had attitude and didn't seem to care about our needs. The food was meh. My friend ordered a house margarita and it tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. So she sent it back and said she didn't want a different margarita. The manager came over and tried to get her to buy the more expensive margarita because it would taste better. I'm sorry, but shouldn't the manager just bring her a complimentary margarita because she was unhappy with her previous one? He lingered longer trying to get her to buy one. The waiter didn't notice our drinks needed to be refilled, so we had to keep reminding him. I ordered some spicy chicken tacos-- the chicken tasted like it had been marinated in Frank's Hot Sauce, yuck! I also asked the manager to put the chicken in corn tortillas instead of the flour tortillas. They charged $2 for doing that!!! What the heck! I've never experienced that. My friends enjoyed their food though. No one was friendly and the manager just seemed clueless. I won't ever be going back."
0,"This is probably one of the most popular bars in Shadyside.  They have a  great wine bottle special, and decent (not great) prices otherwise.  The decor is really nice and posh...it kind of makes you want to put on a collared shirt.  The food is also decent, though not spectacular.  Definitely a nice lunch stopover though. \n\nThe problem with the bar is the crowd at night.  I mean it is CROWDED.  It's next to impossible to get a drink at the bar or from the wait staff, who are really trying their best but are just overwhelmed with people!   Drinks are made ok...I wasn't overly impressed.  I want to like the bar more, but the crowds keep annoying me to the point of wanting to leave.  Also, the bar is really packed with the douchiest people in Shadyside as well, so not only are you crowded into oblivion, but also it's like a Jersey Shore episode in there...not fun.  \n\nOverall, it's not a bad place.  The drinks and such are done ok, bue the crowd is just overwhelming at all times.  I'd go elsewhere if given the option."
1,"Great value for your money, decently priced, pet friendly and clean.  I only stayed one night with my friend but it was very convenient, easy to locate and we had a pleasant stay.  The staff was very polite.\n\nIf you get a chance try Postino's (about a mile away) for some great bruschetta and panini sandwiches."
1,"Great gym, but if you ever try to cancel your agreement count on paying 2-3 months longer than expected.  I've been trying to cancel my account because I moved across\nThe country.  They won't cancel it unless I send in a certified letter.  I've done that and am still getting charged months later."
0,"My co-workers and I were there last evening for Happy Hour, and we can be a large group who enjoy spending a few hours after work together from time to time.  That said, we often find the bar area to be difficult for conversation, so we asked for tables to be pushed together along the back wall, and we asked for separate checks.  What we loved:  hand mixed margaritas (we love the bartenders here) and Negra Modela on draft (why every Mexican restaurant doesn't do this is beyond me).  What we had issues with:  Service, service, service.  We were told separate checks were OK until we got one check and had to split drinks and apps and food orders out ourselves and figure out bill on the back of the check.  Of course, the server could add his 20% on as we were then a large group.  Ah, but his service was not worth 20 %.  I ordered a draft, my friend ordered one bottled beer, and we got two bottled beers (which were a little off in flavor), and he waved me off when I tried to get his attention to remind him that I never got my draft.  Yes there were dinner customers by this time, but there were still a lot of empty tables.  Sorry, Verde, I don't care if you serve gold in your food--teach your servers to handle large groups.  I felt gouged, and I was not alone.  Would we have had this problem at the bar?  Absolutely not.  Will I suggest this for an office function again?  Absolutely not.  Will I meet one or two at the bar for the excellent cocktails?  Of course."
0,"This is a paradise for eaters of dead animals, but not so much for vegetarians, despite the claim of \""farm to table.\""  I certainly consider myself an omnivore, yet found the menu took heavy on fried, cheesy, bready stuff.  Table service was S L O W, and the men's room smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in several days.  When the store is located in Las Vegas, it gets hot, and you need good ventilation/AC.  That wasn't the case here."
0,"If I could give you NO stars I would. I went there on a thursday night at 9:15pm.  The tables were full but there were 5 seats at the bar. The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place.\nThere are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to."
0,Pissed of I order the same thing  every time I come here I love there toasted marshmallow hot chocolate and today of all days they all of a sudden forgot how to make hot chocolate taste like hot water in a cup when asked about the hot chocolate the waiter  brings me flavoring and  say add more very rude then we get are food cold pancakes and cold egg even my sons happy face pancake was cold I'll be going to henderson location instead of this one  for better service
0,"i use to think that there is no other place other than tea station. despite their horrible service, i still continued to buy my tea there. One day, i just couldnt stand it anymore, they had new people working and twice they made my drink wrong. when i have to pay $6 for my boba, it better be my money's worth. i have been ordering the wintermelon milk tea for 2 years and they now tell me that the drink does not exist. they poured milk into the wintermelon green tea that they mistakenly made for me. Of course it did not taste they way it was suppose to. i complained and they did not want to replace my drink until i got a bit furious with them. they ended up just making me a milk tea, which was delicious but i did not enjoy it, just for the fact that i initially wanted my wintermelon milk tea and what they put me through, just for a simple drink."
1,"As a city, Charlotte walks a rather thick line between offering chain & indie options, so it's nice to see a small establishment thrive.  However, the Manor Theater IS a Regal property, so I don't know how \""indie\"" it truly is.  That being said, the Manor definitely captures the feel of a small arthouse, and it's great that we have this option.  With only two screens (hence, \""Twin\""), there's none of the bells and whistles you would normally find at a movieplex: stadium seating, automated ticket machines, or more than two bathroom stalls.  Parking is a bit scarce, as they share a lot with Panera and other businesses, but you can usually find a space around the side or in back.  What you will find is the smell of old movie popcorn, cozy red velvet seats, and a place to see great smaller-budget films.  We're lucky to have a movie theater with a bit of the old magic still left in her."
1,Awesome view awesome sushi. priced on the high end but quality is top notch. our server was great. the service is A+. great place to take a date or with friends.
0,"I would not go back here....EVER! The woman working the door accused my ID of being fake. She asked for a second form of ID. I pulled what I thought was my credit card out of my wallet, however, the bartender at the previous bar gave me the wrong card! Obviously, this did not help my case. I showed her two more credit cards with matching names and asked if I could go back to the previous bar, get my credit card from the bartender, and come back. She said no and threatened to call the police! I told her that was fine with me (I had nothing to hide). Instead, she called her manager over to look at my ID. He sided with her and told me that even if I came back with my credit card, I could not come in because \""you called my employee a B*#$@.\"" I was SO taken aback, because I was not intoxicated and would remember if I called her that name, which I absolutely DID NOT. My friends and I left and went to a different bar. I understand this establishment probably deals with fakes very frequently, but I was extremely disappointed that they were so rude; it was uncalled for. Do not plan any parties here, because you aren't guaranteed that everyone will get in."
0,"Not worth it! The employee behind the counter was more concerned about being able to leave a few minutes early than helping customers find what they needed. She was already irritated due to candle shipment that she had to handle all on her own. We inquired about specific products and they did not carry anything they claimed to carry. They have a very minimal selection, your pretty much wasting your time and gas going. Fantasia, Northern Winds and several others offer much more for better prices and customer service."
0,"I came here a while ago with a group of friends kinda predisposed. I had heard that you need to peel and break everything and that the food is brought in bags and you get stuff all over yourself. This is not my idea of a good time BUT the group I was with had already decided to eat here. We arrived and the place was packed! \n\nWith this in mind, I decided to go with a basketof chicken nuggets and sample food my husband and friends ordered. I was right, I am not a fan. People in the group ordered several seasonings, lemon pepper, cajun, etc. I found that once you peeled the shrimp, they didn't really taste to anything. i would have preferred the shrimp be peeled first then cooked with the seasonings. Everybody at the table enjoyed thei food so, I just figure it's just not my type of place."
1,"Great atmosphere. My friend loved the coffee he ordered. I'm always disappointed, though, when I go to a cool local coffee shop, order a chai latte, and see them grab a box of Tazo mix. I wish they would show as much care in the choice of chai as they do in coffee. That's not enough of an annoyance to stop my coming back, though."
1,"Always have a great time when I come here to stay. Perfect \""diet\"" version of the strip. Kimberly (from Vegas ) at the front desk was super helpful in giving us directions and sending us to non tourist spots. For sure coming back."

0,"Horrible.  The tools were shared between customers, she squirted oil on my toe nails, and immediately placed them in the water, didnt even rub the oil in, at all.  She got up three times in the middle of my leg massage to answer her cell phone or help other clients, the actual massage probably only lasted 30 seconds because she kept getting up. and to top it off, the paint on my nails arent even even!  I am going to redo them.  I got robbed."

0,"If you like Disneyland and waiting hours to ride rides, you will love this s*!t show of an office. My son has seen Dr Burford, Ky, Greenspon, Blank over the past 4 months Plan on being there all day. They moved to an even smaller location this week which is nicer than their \""prison\"" looking old location. However the prison setting is rather appropriate since their staff looks like a bunch of degenerates on a work release program. Do yourself and child better like I did today and fire these losers."
0,"I have several accounts with Wells Fargo.  I get one story at my local branch in Sun City, AZ, and then I see a completely different story when I log on to my account from my home computer.  At my local branch, they easily explained monies that are missing from the joint checking account that I share with my husband.  (Attention Ladies:  The way to maintain independence in a marriage is for both you and your husband to have independent accounts with one joint account into which you can deposit money for the electric bill, water bill, gas bill, etc.  That way if your husband wants to go away for a couple of weeks, he can do so with his own money.   You too can take your own independent vacation, )  At my local branch, I was informed that my husband had withdrawn his money from our joint account to set up his own independent checking account.  This is as it should be.  When I looked online at the joint account, the money has just gone missing with the exception of a couple of large withdrawals that my husband made.  I'm not going to feel very confidant in Wells Fargo until I see what my local bank manager is telling me reflected in my online joint account history."
0,"I stopped by to get some coffee and snack at the center bar. The bartender was loud and awkward in his behaviour ignoring me for the first 5 minutes. He was definitely under the influence. Finally he asked me what i needed (!) I asked him if he could make a cup of iced latte and after the positive answer, ordered such. He made hot coffee, dropped couple ice cubes in it, added milk - that was his definition of ice latte. I didn't want to make a big deal, paid, took my coffee and left. On the way out I sipped my coffee hoping it was ok, but it was disgusting colored water. I had to come back and asked the bartender if he could make another normal one. He turned red, and loudly in aggressive manner was demanding answers what was wrong with the coffee he made. I explained to him after what he yelled in my face i should go get coffee somewhere else. He throw couple dollar bills at me screaming \""you can go and have it on me\""...i actually paid for it (!) I did let him know he is out of control and rude asking to speak to his manager. He yelled me \""And who are you for me to do so?\"" He took a business card out of the pocket throwing it at me, saying \""here, come and visit me!\"" \nThe following day i got a hold of the general manager of double Helix bar and boutique. She seemed to be aware of the situation but expressed very little interest at hearing it from me. There was simply no appology. I made it very clear I didnt come to ask for any accommodation from them, but wanted the bartender to be held accountable for his unappropriate insaulting behaviour. The manager refused to contact the owner and refused to provide me with his contact info. \nThe following day, I was reading some Vegas magazine and ran accross an article about Double Helix and the owner. From that article I got his name and decided to try my luck by emailing him at the address combined in several variations of his first and last name at doublehelix website, hoping he wasn't aware of the situation but can satisfy my request. \nSuprisingly i got an answer from him in a day or so. It was full of protection for his bartender, indicating how great he was and hinting how much i was wrong and unappropriate (!) Are you kidding me?! Big spendings or not, i was a customer! I thanked Mr Nisi for his time but let him know i will use my way for the truth to come out planning on writing the review at least. In return, Mr Nisi got a hold of my employer making up false accusations and saying i was threatening him. Sure, if writing a review is a threat!...I believe i have all rights to do so. It wasn't a threat, it was a promise. \nThe lesson of my story is - there are retailers, bartenders, owners of businesses, people working in customer service who does judge you by the way you are dressed and how much money you spend. They are not willing to take care of you even though it is their job and they are paid for it! We, customers, pay for it. And I refuse to pretend it is ok the get this kind of service in \""high-end\"" place. Wine, dinner, coffee, or water, doesn't matter. And no matter how wonderful Double Helix may sound on their main web page, the reason to have a rude bartender, it is because it is allowed for him to be so, it is beacuse the owner himself exactly like that! Simply a jerk"
0,"I've tried to do business with this Day Subaru location, as well as the one in Moon.  Neither one, in my opinion is a very customer-friendly dealership, and both are out of the market on pricing.  I think there are much better options in the area.  The sales staff seems to be on average as far as product knowledge, but they don't have much else going for them.  The pricing is not competitive."
1,"Went here tonight with three friends for dinner. We were immediately greeted and found a seat next to our friends. Someone came by and got our drink orders right away, and we quickly decided on what we wanted to get. Imagine my delight when I discovered they had a kids' size pho bowl! :) mmmmm\n\nSo anyways, we shared an app of spring rolls which were really good and tasted very fresh. The pho came out shortly after and was equally as good. The owner came by and checked in with us and was very friendly, and our server came by and gave us a few tips on how we could mix the sauces to our liking.\n\nIt's a really nice restaurant in a nice megamart if you will, and I'll definitely be back, especially since it's right down the street."
1,"We stopped at this charming little brew pub on a road trip and I absolutely loved the 1930s style atmosphere! It really adheres to its name. The beer, the food, and the service were great, and we had a wonderful time. I definitely would recommend this restaurant and look forward to giving it another try!"
1,man love the food here ..everything here is excellent always get pan roast or gumbo tried something different this time went with creole superb usually get a level 7 on spicey... this time Tip hooked me up with a 9 ...took sometime to get it down but was simply sensational... love couple places in town this is definite top three places and dishes for me in valley.
0,Made an appointment for pickup at 830am for flight at 10am. At 840 called the operator to ask where the shuttle was and he said it will be there in 10min because of traffic but road was empty at this time. At 855 called again and she said car was still in traffic. Vegas is not that big. Ended up just taking a taxi and praying I dont miss my flight
1,"I enjoy shopping at the Fresh Market from time to time for gourmet and organic items.  Since it isn't as convienant to me as HT,  Trader Joes, and Earthfare,  I typically only stop in here when I am headed to a party or potluck.  \n\nThe bakery is good and each day they have fresh selections of specialty items - their napoleons are really decadent. We also like their \u00e9clairs and cr\u00e9me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. They have a pretty good selection of wines, cheeses, gourmet flatbreads and crackers.   \n\nI also enjoy their selection of imported and nostalgic candies. If you have a sweet tooth but need to avoid sugar, they have a big selection of sugar free candies as well."
0,"Horrible!  We waited for over an hour for 3 gluten free fried rice dishes and one other dish.  Finally had to ask to see the manager.  He was stunned we were waiting. Many, many other tables had come and gone.  Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait.  The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free.  We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue.  It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue!  Will not go back to this location ever!"
0,"If there was an option for ZERO this would've been it. My boyfriend and I went in for the Portobello mushroom burger during lunch...he orders it and was told they run out of the bread. We ask if there was anything for our inconvenience....the MANAGER comes out and says no. He says they ran out and can't discount the meal. He didn't even apologize for not having the bread. Fine we said. I ordered the 10 pieces nugget instead.  The food came out cold and the nuggets taste like it's been sitting out since this morning.  Bad service!..,check!  Cold food!...check!  Not coming to this location again."
0,"Not really a fan. The mongolian beef was blah.  The meat was tough and some parts were crunchy.  The meat is very cheap quality.  Definitely not the same meat that's pictured on their display.  The rice was a bit raw in some of my bites. And overall they drowned my rice in the sauce.  I forced myself to eat half of it.  It's also pretty expensive.  $12 for my rice bowl, soda and 2 small eggrolls.  I would not come back again."
0,"One liner:  Overpriced small bowls of Asian food.\n\nOrdered the Pad Thai. The noodles were overly cooked and completely broken.  It was a disaapointment at best.  The other thing I had issue with was the price.  Way too high for the small bowl of food I got for it. The woman at the counter was very nice and very cheerful.  If not for her, this would have gotten a 1=star."
1,"While shopping at Wal*Mart in Laveen today, the smell of the bread baking in this place made me hungry, so I dropped in.  I enjoyed an excellent 6\"" sandwich AND a bowl of good Cream of Broccoli soup, BOTH, for $4.33 including the tax!  Can you imagine?  This place is the killer deal!"
0,"This is hard to say... But I do not enjoy my visits here. They are slow, crammed, difficult to get in line, and even harder to find space to wait for drinks or even fix my drink after. I love SB but this one needs a bigger store and better service."
0,Thought I would come here and get my oil changed with a free wash. Well. Won't do that again. Oil change costs less at the dealer. They said the wait for the oil change was 15 minutes but the wash would take a lot longer. The free wash is just a run through and no dry. So I upgrade. I come out after the oil change and there are only two cars ahead of me. The girl working on my car is too busy talking with every one else and not working much on my car. This is silly. My last visit here. $87 total bill. (Including air filter)
0,"Don't go for breakfast unless you want sweet crepes. Hubby and I had egg, cheese, bacon crepes and they were soggy, squishy, and tasteless. No side dish-just a single crepe on a small plate. Coffee was good and seemed like lots of people there for lunch-type items so maybe that's better but I was really hoping for something like a crepe Lorraine with hollandaise on it but they have no sauces. Not coming back, unfortunately. Was very much unimpressed."
1,"I went there with a couple of buddies the first time we all did a trip to Vegas. They told me to pick a spot and since we were walking through Caesar's Palace, I just let my nose lead us. It led us to Trevi's. We all fell in love with the calamari!! Also the Crab/spinach/artichoke dip was awesome!!! The drink menu also has some very nice drinks on it. Since then I have been back to Vegas 3 times and every time we get off the plane, we drop off our stuff and go straight to Trevi's. But now we get the Fritto Misto!! Try it!!! My mouth waters every time we talk about it!! The place does get busy though.......so if you are impatient....go some where else!!!"
0,"Way too much hype about this place which is maybe why I was more disappointed than I would have been otherwise.  I ordered the egg scramble with roasted chicken and potatoes on the side.  It was BLAND. Even after adding an exorbitant amount of salt, it still was just blah.  The potatoes were fine, but OraIda at home would have been just as good.\n\nThe people I was with got the fried chicken and waffles.  The chicken was very bland, as well.  Crispy, but flavorless.  \n\nOverall disappointing.\n\nService was just so-so.  \n\nHash House A NO Go."
0,"I took my 2 year old and 8 year old there. Great for children over 5, but for little ones. They don't have a good selection for 3 years and under, especially for $10. I rather have went to McDonalds."
0,"Mediocre food, high prices.\n\nDon't come here unless you care more about showing than anything else. And even in that case, go somewhere that's actually classy with good food, i.e. Queue de Cheval"
0,I love the food and the great service BUT I made reservations for my work event (7 people) and the location on Tropicana was closed.  I wish they would have told me this when I called the Tropicana number and made the reservations???\nWe had to wait for a taxi to take us to the 2nd location.  Not a good way to impress the owner of your company
0,"I originally moved into Courtney Village Apartments back in September 2010. Despite the sketchy surrounding neighborhood and higher priced rent, it was a nice centralized location that fit my lifestyle at the time. \n\nI will say that the benefit of location is a huge plus for Courtney Village. You are less than 10 minutes from ASU and oldtown Scottsdale. Less than 30 minutes from almost every part of the valley. \n\nAnother benefit is their dog park. A good core group of residents frequent the dog park multiple times a week. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people and all they ask is that your dog not be a total dick. It gives the complex a greater sense of community.\n\nUnfortunately, those are the only two benefits that Courtney Village offers. The apartment office is rude and unresponsive to resident inquiries. They advertise a \""gated\"" community, but will let the gates sit broken and open for weeks at a time, giving anyone the ability to enter the complex. They promise a 48-hour maintenance work order fix, but refuse to co-ordinate their maintenance appointments with the resident's schedule. They expect you to let their maintenance guys have carte blanche access to your home without ever meeting them. They are so committed to this 48 hour time frame that if you try to call a work order in with a desired fix date more than 48 hours out, they will tell you that you need to call back closer to the desired date. \n\nAnother issue with the office is that everyone is in \""cover your ass\"" mode. Employees are quick to throw others under the bus for misinformation and also will lie to a resident at the drop of a hat. My last rent check took over four weeks to be cashed by the office. I called after two weeks to make sure my payment was applied. The office assured me that they had cashed the check and that it must be a problem with my bank. Sure enough, once my check was cashed and I looked at the deposit date, it was deposited on the 27th of the month. Maybe instead of lying to a resident, they could just admit that they fucked up instead of leading someone on a wild goose chase with their bank over outstanding checks.\n\nThe biggest problem is that Courtney Village believes they have some sort of inflated value based on their apartment's location. They will try to charge you almost $900 a month for a 2 bedroom, 1,050sq ft apartment. They do this despite having a trailer park a block to the west, being 1/4th of a mile away from a complex where two men broke into the apartment of a woman and proceeded to rape and rob her, and also 1/4th of a mile away from a National Guard base where a solider was stabbed while taking out the trash. They refuse to even hire a security guard to do nightly checks, instead relying on the two residents who are Phoenix police members to demonstrate a level of security in the complex that does not exist. Seems like the more the neighborhood goes downhill, the higher they raise their rates. They also won't give any current residents a fair shake when it comes to renewing their lease. My buddy continued to pay nearly $800 a month for the same model unit that they rented to his neighbors for $750 two weeks earlier. Seems that they would rather risk bringing in new tenants at a slightly higher price point than working with current residents. \n\nThis review may seem negative, and in all honesty it is, but this complex is ran by a very negative group of people. They try to work you with their community bullshit, but at the end of the day they could care less if your car is broken into or if the grounds look nice or if your apartment is taken care of. They only care about that rent check being dropped in their mail on the 1st. Avoid the bullshit and find a nicer, safer, cleaner place closer to Scottsdale or ASU for the same price point."
0,"The food is good, but the service isn't. Weekend mornings are a nightmare here, also they frequently run out of things."
0,"Just very bad all around.   Checkin was complicated, charged for a standard carrying and crew at departure gate was CLUELESS!!!  Extremely unprofessional with lots chaos and loud conversations in what looked like a very standard boarding group!"
0,"A year after cancelling all services we suddently get another charge on our Amex. Turns out that all the services has \""magically\"" been renewed and auto-renewing has been turned on. Impressive how that happens all by itself.\n\nAnyway, called in to cancel again, and made a dispute through Amex. \n\nTo my surprise, you can't cancel your account with GoDaddy - it will exist forever. That's their company policy. So unless you want to be in ther system forever, and get obscure random charges, be careful with signing up.\n\n\nPS: \""John\"" from billing, didn't want to help, and claimed that he didn't have a supervisor that I could talk to about the issue."
0,"I have been here for 45 minutes waiting for a mani while my Mom has been getting her toes done. They really need to tell you how long it's going to be so they don't waste your time.  This has been nothing but a waste of my time.  I'm glad they are busy, I want the local businesses to be successful, but not at the expense of my time."
1,"For some reason I just really enjoyed my shopping experience at this mall. The handful of stores I went to all had tons of men's clothing options. At Nordstroms, The Rail was bigger than any other one I've seen. Also, the Banana Republic had tons of sizes and lots of styles. I actually enjoyed this place more than my experience at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa (overrated people...I know I know...this is just my opinion). I also really liked the layout...I dunno, it was just kind of open and nice. Maybe I have a biased opinion because I found so much clothing there. \n\nBut...Sommerset Collection in Troy, MI is still the mall of malls in my opinion ;)"
1,"Located on the second floor of the California Hotel we just happened to stop by the hotel to get teriyaki beef jerky for my uncle at another store there and felt like some Hawaiian shaved ice!  So although I wanted coconut and lime flavor they were out of coconut so I got mango and lime instead and the serving was hugh like a volcano!  We also order some sorbet and it was delish.  Prices are very reasonable and the scoops are big!  Lucky we stopped by as after that, the line was long as there was only one person working there."
1,The sushi here is wonderful. The service is top-notch and the portions are very generous. \nTheir menu offers a wide variety of rolls and traditional sushi and sashimi favorites.\nWhat makes Red so special is that it's not your run-of-the-mill sushi chain restaurant.
0,"Cold mugs, and cappuccinos the size of lattes. It's details like that differentiate the good coffee places from the bad ones. and Holley's Cuppa falls into the latter category. \n\nIf you want a legit cup of coffee served right this is not the place to go. \nIf you want a nice place to sit and relax this is also not the place. \n\nPersonally, I had a lot of issues here but, If you like your coffee to be like a sweet treat, and prefer take it to go then Holley's might be worth a try."
1,"BJ's is always a great place to go eat, and drink if you choose.. Always great service.\nNice menu, popular prices. Lots of TV's.  Love their burgers,. Soup and Salad a greart deal. Salads great,  Just enjoy BJ's.   A solid value. What more can one ask for,"
0,"I so wanted to love this spa. But sadly, it was a huge disappointment.  I set up apts for my husband and I to get massages. I thought the rates were decent, especially for Vegas. But the minute we walked in, it was like a cattle call. The front desk had a line and you paid before your service (which is rare given that you already have a credit card down to hold the apt) my issue with this is normal spas will add/change massage type based on your and the therapists discussion. Or allow you to add aromatherapy in the room. Not here. You pay in a loud lobby, then are shuffled to a check in area for slippers/robe. This was not relaxing either. there were piles of used slippers and robes, and a desk attendant asking your size and then asking you to step to the side so she can help the group of people behind you. Then you and others are escorted (in a loud fashion) back to the dressing rooms, and they assign you a locker one by one...right down a row. Did I mention, I wasn't there with this group? You get a partial tour and then off they go.\n\nMaybe I am used to upper end spas, but most treat you one on one. They provide you with a calm/quiet tour and ask if they can bring you anything to drink. That isn't the case here. There are carafes of water and paper cups, but nothing fancy. \n\n\nI tried to shake off the noise and undress. I felt weird because most everyone was in a swimsuit. I was not. I had a robe on, but for my steam room and shower and spa I normally am nude. There were a couple other people there who were like me but the majority of the people were suited. \nI showered, again nothing fancy in the way of body lotions/shampoos- just generic  \""shampoo\"" gallons.  It was this way for all the amenities.\n\nWhen I walked by the towel bin by the spa area, some  towels had blood on it. I covered the mess with a towel and walked to the front desk (in my robe) and let them know the towels were over flowing and that there was some sanitation issues.  They thanked me and went back quickly to take care of it. \n\n\nIt was so busy that I couldn't go in the hot tub. It was a normal \""oversized hot tub\"" that maybe 10 people could fit in. There were already 8 or 9 and I wasn't looking to sit super close to strangers. And then the chairs surrounding it were full as well.  \n\nI decided to just do the steam rooms and showers and then wait for my massage.\nThe place is like a maze, but to get to the co-ed space, you have to zig zag down some long haul ways, but you finally find it. It is a cool space. And there is a relaxing salt room. I don't know why it is called that, it is just a warm room, with comfy seats and dim lights for the 'sky'. But it was quiet. Finally.\n\nMy husband even commented how the massage staff just walk around calling out names (loudly) and so it takes away from the relaxing vibe. There was also massage therapists walking into the space, with coffee in hand and carrying all their bags - as if they were just getting to work. \n\nOnto my massage, it was good. Not great. But it was good. I enjoyed the room, the bed was warm. And the massage therapist just did her thing.\nThere was no spa like smells, or scented lotions. But it was nice.\nWhen you are done, they show you cards, and ask you to choose one, but you don't really understand the point until they give you the card and say it is a gift. It is like a motivational bookmark."
0,"The food is good, but I got screwed there. I ordered the French toast and our waitress said, \""would you like bacon or sausage?\"" So I said, \""oh, wow. Well, sausage I guess.\"" The check comes and I've been charged FOUR DOLLARS for the sausage I didn't even want. Beware!"
0,"Pros: There are lots of options, and the portion sizes are big.  The ingredients are fresh, and the staff is courteous.\n\nCons: The food is only OK.  Every meat dish we ordered came out a little overcooked and tough, and there was way too much cilantro in almost everything.  And while the prices aren't exorbitant, it's not exactly a great value either."
1,"I'm glad the intoxicating sweet aroma of crepes doesn't make it out beyond the front door or else this quaint little place would be packed, with nowhere to sit. Luckily, it was a Tuesday morning so we shared our brunchtime with just a handful of other lucky patrons. Great cozy atmosphere, tasty yummies and lovely, gratious service."
1,"Hang with me here..... I had a vertebrate paleontology class in college.  Our professor often discussed the lack of evolutionary changes in crocodilian species over the course of millions of years while other species have evolved all sorts of other features.  He basically said \""it's not possible to do what they do any better.  A bigger brain means they'd probably lose jaw muscle.  Larger body size means they'd probably lose some of their ability to sneak up on prey.  Over the course of millions of years, these things would be a big deal.\""  Point being, crocodiles haven't evolved because they're perfect as is for what they do.  Well, for what it is, Which Wich does a perfect job.\n\nTons of options, all completely customizeable, fairly fast service, high quality ingredients, toasting capabilities, inexpensive, friendly staff that aren't afraid to interact with their customers, etc.  Perfect lunch spot.  It can get crowded (obviously a good problem to have), so come during off hours or plan on getting it to go."
0,"If you know exactly what you want and need NO assistance whatsoever, and you happen to be lucky enough to find it in your size, then by all means go here.  If you need any help whatsoever, you'd be better off wandering the parking lot for a knowledgeable squirrel.  This has happened EVERY time we have gone there for shoes etc over the last several years, so roughly 8 times in the last 4 or 5 years.\n\nToday, I went to buy new hiking boots and possibly rollerblades or roller skates.  Not an employee in sight.  I located and tried on four pair of hiking boots and settled on one that I liked, but wanted to try the next size up.  I couldn't see any in the size I wanted, but noticed the two shelves higher than what I could reach had several boxes BEHIND the front boxes.  No ladders or stools anywhere.  No employees anywhere.  I eventually slid a bench over to the area, climbed on top & looked for myself.  Nope, none in the next size up.  Looked & looked for someone who worked there, in hopes that they could call another store to see if they had that size in stock.  I gave up after lapping the store twice.\n\nOk, so forget the hiking boots.  I still would like blades or skates though.  Rollerskates:  one pair for girls, one for men.  No women's.  None!  Rollerblades: three different ones in stock, all seemed really REALLY crappy, and one style was completely sold out, which I will assume was the only decently-made pair out of the bunch.  Had some questions about the crappy ones, but again...not a soul in sight.  I give up.  Zappos, here I come!\n\nAlso, if you are a thief, this is your place.  I am very confident I could have loaded a cart full of stuff & waltzed out the door.  I seriously wondered if the doors were accidentally left unlocked and the store was really supposed to be closed.  3pm on a Tuesday, too.  Unbelievable."
1,"This is a great local place to get anything done.\nI was really nervous about going blonde because I'm a natural brunette and my hair is picky. But Hayley put me at ease and assured me it would look great, and it did! The atmosphere is amazing, and everyone is so nice. My friend and I were offered free muffins and drinks and felt completely comfortable. They even own a cafe and botique next door! This place is awesome, and worth every penny."
0,Returned here because the 1st time was so awesome.. Not this time.  The Service was horrible-- guy was slow - didnt tell us all the specials.  And they were not busy.  The lobster was gross..  Ordered a bottle of Champagne asked for it to be chilled and brought table side-- wouldnt do it..  \n\nJust bad all the way around.\nand Yes we left a tip that reflected the service and the waiter ran after us when we were already almost in the casino-- asked what the problem why the tip was so small - I said the service was horrible - his response can you be specific I said YOUR SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE.  \nTacky--  \nI will give a hefty tip if the food is average --here both were horrible.
1,E2 is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. You will not be disappointed. The dining room is small so be sure to call ahead.
1,"Do you love hotdogs? That amazing shlong of processed mystery meats? That discolored stick of tender whatsit?\n\nI know I love a good hotdog. And the Franktuary has the best dogs in the city, and easily so. They pile a crap load of toppings on your dog, and they are crisp and freshly cooked for your eating pleasure. \n\nMake sure to get two- one just isn't enough. Trust me."
1,"Yes, loud music but who cares when it is GREAT music? Looking around, everyone was chair dancing, singing along, having a blast. Food was PERFECT!! Fabulous Vegas dinner experience- can't wait to go back to eat here again!  And yes, only  2 bathrooms, but walk a very short distance and take care of it...."
0,"After my first experience here, the food was good, but the service... ditzy. Does anyone who works here know what they're doing? I figured they'd just transitioned to the new downtown location and needed to work out some kinks. The issues weren't bad enough that I wouldn't come back, so I decided to give them a second chance. \n\nSecond chance, we called in an order to go. Just a large pepperoni pizza, nothing too difficult. The girl on the phone sounded super confused like she didn't know what was going on and my husband even commented that he was worried we'd get there and there would be a problem with the order. So we get there, I tell them I called in and order, and the 5 people working there all look around at each other and say, \""I didn't take an order\"". After telling them, \""Someone answered the phone because I placed an order\"" a girl comes out of the back and said she as the one who took the order. She handed us the pizza and didn't say anything. I had to ask what we owed. She looked lost and confused like she was on pills. The rest of the staff then tried to overcompensate by being phony friendly, which I wasn't going to buy since one of the girls was on her cell phone texting and wouldn't look at us. \n\nOverall, the food isn't bad, but I'm not sure it's worth dealing with the incompetent staff. I may give them one final chance before writing them off altogether."
1,"I've shopped this location through the last few renditions, (ABCO, Sun Market) and now Asiana Market.  They've really cleaned it up over the last year and it's a solid place to go for a variety of import foods from the Orient, Middle East, and the Mediterranian.  Produce is incredibly inexpensive with hard-to-find items."
0,"Okay, I thought AJ's fine foods was a rip-off for sushi, but NO SIR! I forked over $13 for a rainbow roll to go at this place! (This was a to-go order) When they gave me my cash back, they did not even give me my left over change! I though 'For a freakin $13, this better be a good roll!' NOPE! It was the skimpiest roll I've ever seen! Was in a hurry, took off and ate it. Wasn't a good roll and the 'crab mix' was just smothered in lemon juice! It just tasted like lemon! Later I knew why, I GOT MEDUIM-MILD FOOD POISONING FROM THIS!! I've eaten around a few hundred rolls since I was a kid and this is the first food poisoning I've ever had! \n\nRIP OFF, SKIMPY AND LOW-QUALITY SUSHI, FOOD POISONING, what should this tell you?"
1,this place was awesome. Me and my girlfriend went here for their college night on a tuesday. We paid $5 for her and $10 for me for all you can drink from 9-12. All the bartenders were very friendly and kept the drinks coming as fast as we could drink them. We tipped a dollar after every drink and prolly had 25 between the two of us in 2 hours. We played beer pong and had a great night. This was a perfect place to go to on a tuesday night inside of our hotel.
0,This wasnt bad pizza. I just lived in a city with a really great pizza culture.. so i was really let down when i moved back home. This wasn't  horrible this wasn't great ... is was just okay . \nTHe garlic knots .. just okay .. and the wings ... and service was meh
0,"The service does not exist here.  The worker is just laughing and hanging out with a friend while you self-serve and have to interrupt their conversation to pay.  The worker was chatting with her friend even while I'm paying.\n\nThat said, their yogurt is one of my favorites :)  Try their greek yogurt.  Everything else is icy and not my taste."
0,"This dental practice has very unfriendly service all around. Despite the fact that I started out on the wrong foot with the rude front office, I was looking for a dentist in my neighborhood to build a relationship with and I made appointments with this office for me, my husband and my daughter. \n\nUnfortunately I left here feeling very weary of the \""plan\"" they gave us. First of all, we keep up with our dental hygiene so there shouldn't have been any major issues. We all waked out of there with expensive bills for services that weren't needed and we all felt very pressured to buy these services. \n\nI didn't breathe a word of my feelings to my family as I wanted to see what their take was on the practice. My two family members, who don't usually have an opinion, were also very unhappy and uncomfortable. \n\nI haven't gone back and I will not recommend anyone to this practice."
0,"I find their instructor's voices, speech cadence and pseudo-spiritual narrative to be awfully annoying. I would rather they just allow some silence in the class. But, it is a good workout, not too expensive...and I suppose it's good practice to learn to learn to tune it out."
1,"No lie, I love Razzy Fresh.\n\nSo I docked a star because sometimes the people behind the counter are sort of lacking in personality, as in, they don't even greet you or say hello. But other than that, this place is awesome.\n\nWhat I love about Razzy Fresh is their diversity in flavors. Fiance and I are big dessert fans and I always feel a little bummed when we hit up a froyo place that is heavy on candy toppings and sweet flavors and light to nonexistent on fruit and tart flavors. Bobby likes the former and I like the latter. Razzy Fresh is awesome because they have both. Not only that, but in addition to carrying the classic flavors, you also see things like green tea and salted caramel pretzel. The fruit usually looks fresh and good (the strawberries and raspberries tonight were really delicious!) If you're awesome, you know Taro is the best flavor.\n\nOh, and maybe the best part about them? They're open late. I can't be the only person that gets a hankering for dessert around 10:30pm, right?"
0,"Be warned if you are thinking of purchasing one of the Living Social deal coupons that came out in today's e-mail, this business is out of business.  They have not been paying their bills, taxes included, and basically trying to scam the system.  Check the City of Peoria court records, they were formally evicted in October and have known they would not be in business to see these coupons used.  I posted something on Facebook about it and they promptly removed it and blocked me - they know what I am saying is true and they want to continue to perpetrate the fraud.\n\nSo if you want to waste your money, go ahead and purchase one but just so you know Living Social has been contacted.  Below is what I posted on FB earlier...\n\n\""Just to set the record straight... when you don't pay your obligations like rent and taxes you give up the right to be in business. Having said the landlord sold the building is not true, get your facts straight and don't mislead the public. You need to pay your bills. And if you are using the Living Social deal to get the money back you have been reported to them as having gone out of business.\"""
1,Brisket nachos are the bomb! Staff is great. Very friendly.
0,"Had my wind shield replaced and it leaked water through the seal and shorted out electronics in dash. They replaced the seal the next day, they damaged molding on drivers side of car. Josh at head quarters spoke to local guy, local guy said they would call me to get it fixed. Its been 2 weeks and no one has contacted me ... Stay away from them, spend the extra money to get it done right the first time....."
0,"This place serves the worst ribs I have ever had in my life.  I complained twice to the waitress about how bad the ribs were, but she didn't do anything about it.  DO NOT EAT HERE."
1,Great office location. You never have to wait all that long to see your doctor. I don't think I've ever been here longer than an hour (except for the surgery of course). Great Staff throughout office. Dr Grondel is great. Repaired my ACL and put together a great recovery plan. Couldn't be happier to be playing basketball again!
0,"This is a reasonably modern theater with good stadium seating, decent prices on concessions, and decent ticket prices (plus they have student tickets).  I also like their loyalty cup program (buy a four dollar cup and you get refills for a buck for the balance of the year).\n\nThere are plenty of downsides, though.  My primary complaint is that they don't do enough to keep the screening environment pleasant.  The patrons are very loud and very rude, and the theater staff just ignores it.  The last movie I saw here was full of talkers.  The guy sitting in front of me was texting and surfing the web on his Blackberry the whole time, and at one point in the middle of the movie he actually GOT ON HIS PHONE and had a conversation.  What the hell man?  Now a rude patron isn't the fault of the movie theater, but when the manager was standing ten feet away and didn't intervene, that's not right.  They should enforce their no phone policy and make the experience comfortable for the rest of us.  Also, they don't shut the door to their auditoriums, which mean light from the hall gets in and hits the screen.  Very distracting.\n\nThere are plenty of better megaplexes around here."
1,"My favorite place in Phoenix to grab a Perfect Pint. I think Guinness in an Irish pub just tastes better. And at Rosie's its even better thanks to the lively pub. My friends and I go come here whenever possible, its always a great time with great friends, great drink, and at a great place. Rosie's is that place where you always bump into someone you know. It makes this city seem just a little bit smaller. If you get there early enough for dinner, try the fish and chips, it's pretty tasty. But really, Guinness is a meal unto itself. Just grab a booth, sit back, and enjoy the night."
0,"Discrimination served. Sofia's likes locals only and makes sure you know you don't belong. We tried to stop on the way through town to eat lunch and were lucky to get any food at all. One of us didn't get any food, two of us got the wrong order served to us. It also took over an hour to get the little food we did get which only makes a long drive even longer. We won't bother again."
1,"Clean rooms, and decent prices throughout the year. We stayed the second night of Memorial Day weekend here, and took the cab to the strip. Much better than one of the cheapo places closer to the action. Our bathroom shower even had a view of The Strip! The rooms are large, and the beds are comfortable and clean. ****\n\nThe casino itself feels new if you don't compare it to the brand new locations on The Strip, and has a great screening area for big games. The only downside outside of location is that it's clientele is a mix of families and seniors. Not very lively. ****"
1,Very good! I love the chicken kabobs and I think its called greek chicken pita.  The dressing they have on the table is very good  to add. Good price and atmosphere too!
1,"Not bad for a chain. I like that they have the peanuts. :)\n\nFor the celiacs... they have a gluten free menu!  I did not get glutened when ordering off that menu.\n\nThe steaks... PERFECTLY cooked.  It couldn't have been done better, and that's rare these days."
1,"This place is AMAZING! The quality of the vintage clothing is top notch and you can actually shop it! What I mean by that is....it is NOT your typical vintage shop where they cram as many clothes on the rack that they can to where things get damaged and it is impossible to even shop. The staff is incredibly helpful, friendly and knowledgable of the eras and designers they have. If you have something particular you are looking for...they have it and if not they will go above and beyond to make sure they find it for you! \n\nI have never been to a vintage clothing store to where they will actually spend time with you to make sure they find you the right piece of clothing that fits you like a glove! \n\nThey have it all from the 1920's to the 1980's..dresses, purses,hats,jewelry, men's accessories! So...go there...shop and have a wonderful experience! I promise you will not be disappointed"
1,"MMM MMM GOOD! \n\nI love wing stop I always get the same thing every time I go here, I get there Parmesan Chicken Wings w/ xtra ranch and a side of fries and a sweet tea. MMM the wings are ORGASMIC in my mouth very mouth watering and delicious! The fries are different like no other there sweet and always fresh and I love there ranch i could drink a gallon of it! Never had bad food from here, I love this place! \n\nOnly complaint is every time I order its a 20min wait at least and its pretty pricey for fast food its about $20 bucks for two people to eat here but deff worth it =)"
1,"I love it here! Serena is so serene, and so is this place. Amazing facial with organic local products and I feel amazing. Will certainly be sending others to you as well to experience this greatness. Thank you infinitely!"
1,Surprisingly good food.
0,"As much as I love Carolinas, I got sick for the 2nd time recently.\nA breakfast burrito (Chorizo and egg) which looked a little grey, but tasted good. \nI wasn't horribly sick (like what happened the time before), but it was enough.\nI can't go back.  At least for a year or two until I forget.\n\nI just worry sometimes that things happen so fast in there is the quality and cleanliness always what it needs to be.\n\nI have eaten at the Cactus store 100 times and sick twice is too much.\nStill great food and a great spot, just need them to be more careful."
1,"Went here for my first time with a coworker for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered off their value menu which ranged from $1 to just under $2. I got a salad, chicken leg, and a small taco for around $3 - not a bad price, especially if you're low on funds or just cheap.\n\nThe people were really friendly and had our orders out right away. I liked that they had a little salsa bar with lemons and peppers that you could take to go... not a bad option for a nice quick lunch!"
0,"Do not waste your time.  I knew it was not worth a visit as soon as I got off my bike and took my gear and helmet off and put everything away. A wonderful looking man with tattoos all over his body came out to me and my motorcycle and he told me I needed to turn my bike around. He wanted me to back in, instead of pulling in forward.  I asked why and I told him I  don't see a sign that says I must  back in.  He said that's the way I like it. I like uniformity and you need to turn the bike around.  I said if I get back on that bike I am just leaving and I will not come in to buy lunch or beers.  To top it off my bike was the only bike in the entire parking lot for bikes.  This guy told me if I didn't turn it around I can leave.  I said fine and I left.  This man works as security at the Bar.  He has no class and has more money in his skin than he probably has in the bank.   I do not recommend anyone go there if this is the kind of people that are inside.  Be careful and be on the look out for this neanderthal."
0,"I'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast!! Ordered a pizza last night with sausage, cheese and fresh basil.. the baked the fucking basil so it turned black and nasty.. the sausage tasted like it was on the verge of spoiling, very gamy!! Plus the older woman behind the counter was not pleasant at all.. where is the old man, I miss his surly service and his killer pies!"
1,Great beer selection. Many on tap and I was offered a free flight of beer to sample some. Many TV's so great for sports watching. I tried the happy hour sliders and they were very good. Not sure how long they have been open and I remember this place under another name. Based on some of the other negative reviews I assume they had some opening difficulties as most new restaurant do.
0,I'd rather have Chipotle.
0,"I got a Burrito Bowl yesterday to go and as soon as I opened to dig in there was a HAIR in it. How disgusting, don't get me wrong I love Chipotle but this was just too gross. I've permanently checked this location off my list."
1,"Out of the way - but well worth the visit. Good selection of beers and 2 floors of great atmosphere.\nI love the food and the salads are indeed the best you can get - Well done to Steph (the Food / Kitchen Manager) I love coming here by myself and with Friends. There is always someone I meet that I know. The bar staff is very friendly and helpful. The place is big, HUGE even in comparison with Boda, Sofi's, Victoria & JP's (in order of size) - this is a bar that can host many local, area and yes, (inter-) national events and they do.\nKnitting, baking, jogging, tastings and disco's (or should I say clubbing) Swedish Mafia stylee :o) \nI like it and only wished it was closer to town.."
1,Biggest regret is moving to awahtukee I cant get my gold chef fix as often as I used to. This is totally a family run little restaurant and the owner is so freaking sweet. She always greets with a huge smile and makes the place fun to visit she has a great sense of humor... on to the food its well priced NY Style chinese food that I dare say is better than some local places that are actually in Ny. I have yet to order something off the menu that I didnt like its all so yummy.  When I buy a house I hope its next to Gold Chef!
0,Service was slow because of the crowd there to see the fight. Food was served lukewarm and it was difficult to get condiments or even napkins. Will have to give them another chance the next time I'm in Charlotte.
0,Is this place serious?! The Manager here needs to be fired. I had to interject at the Manager making excuses at a nearby table. What a joke. This place should be happy it is so busy. Hire more help and quit complaining to your paying customers. Time for a new restaurant at LAS.
0,"Years ago this was the place to be after sports nights. My softball team and I would take over the porch. Now .... I just feel like they need to do some updating. You can smell the grease in the parking lot. Most of the tables and chairs are from 10 years ago. don't get me wrong, a bar is a bar and Montford is the place to be. Just think Ale's needs to step it up like the bowling alley did."
0,"Ugh. The friendly staff gets four stars but the building is atrocious. Decor is beyond tacky, elevators are scary, and the whole place needs an upgrade badly. Yeah, sure its cheap and not the MGM but the only reasons that I can think of anyone wanting to stay here is if they're really tight on budget or just want to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while gambling. At least the rooms don't seem to have bedbugs."
0,"At first I read all the reviews on this place and I would have agreed with them if I wrote this after this store opened.  However, now that I have been there a few times and have noticed a decline I can say with confidence that I cannot go back to this place.  \n\nLast year around this same month I picked up some kosher meat and took it home to prepare it.  I opened the package and found a large metal shard embedded in the meat.  I took it back and did not go back until last week.  \n\nLast week I bought Almond Milk thinking it would be safe and the price was right.  I got it home and let it get cold over night.  The next day I opened it and began to pour it into a bowl when a very thick black hair (with the root attached) came out of it.  I was disgusted.  I poured it right back in there and took it back the next day. \n\nThere are no quality checks that go on with this company and if you decide to eat anything from this place you are doing so at your own risk.   \n\nI also noticed a decline in the customer service. The last two times I have been there both cashiers were clearly angry at something. The first one threw my items across the check-out counter, and then threw them into my bag. The second cashier that rang up the hair filled milk did not even look at me.  She purposefully kept looking over and around me but never at me to acknowledge me in any way, shape, or form.\n\nI cannot recommend this place to anybody and neither should you."
1,"Some of these 1 and 2 star reviewers need to go eat at Denny's more often if all they want is a cattle trough feeding experience. You had to wait for a table?  Well no kidding.  When the place has 9 or 10 tables, there might indeed be a wait.  \n\nSome of us like a leisurely weekend breakfast or brunch at a small, family owned cafe and we don't mind the wait.   \n\nThe facts are that Yoli's has very good food that is delivered with a smile by a staff that feels more like family than strangers if you bother to step into the place more than once.  \n\nPrices are very reasonable for everything on the menu.  The cheddar biscuits are amazingly good.  Breakfast skillets, omelettes, pancakes, etc. are all delicious and the portions are very generous.   \n\nThe wait for food has never seemed excessive to me after eating here at least 15 times.  Wait times seem appropriate given a small kitchen and small kitchen staff and everything on the menu being made to order."
0,"I should preface this by saying I'm a bit of a hotel snob. Maybe not \""snob\"", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.\n\nActually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nThe non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.\n\nHowever, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.\n\nThe room itself was \""meh\"" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.\n\nI ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.\n\nThe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.\n\nTo be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff. Everyone I interacted with, from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets, concierge, casino staff, convention area staff, etc. were all pleasant and professional. The staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one."
1,"Most definitely one of the best if not the best tacos I have ever had. I got their lengua, cabeza, and carne asada tacos and I have to tell you... it is amazing. I really have nothing else to say. There are so many words that describe the greatness of this place but... I just can't. Speechless. \n\nPRO TIP: The wait is pretty long so definitely expect a long line... Come with 3 or more people so that you guys can wait in the 3 separate lines. There are three different lines (stations) with different meats so if you come with more people, you guys can wait in separate lines and get more variety. That's pretty much all you have to know. NOW GO!"
1,"Best veggie burger ever! You can't beat the $3 drafts on Tuesdays either. The staff is awesome and make sure you all of they have specials, they come up with some ridiculous burgers."
0,"I could not recommend this business.  A recent install of a small piece of vinyl was poorly done and I had to clean up after the workers left.  Wax (from the bottom of the toilet) was in the bathtub and one of the workers had something on the bottom of his shoe that stained my carpet.  Can't believe the installers do not wear booties.  When I voiced my concerns the man in charge got very defensive. I did take pics in case this becomes a \""he said, she said\"".  Not a good experience for the high price!"
0,"Very disappointing experience.  We went for dinner on a Sunday evening and arrived at the restaurant around 5:15 PM.  We had been looking forward to ordering some pho but were informed that about 70% of the items listed on the menu were not available (including any pho).  The dishes we ordered very ok but not good enough to leave a lasting impression.  In addition, the restaurant did not accept our restaurant.com gift certificate and also does not accept credit cards.  Time to look for another Vietnamese restaurant with better service and food."
1,We went here for Sunday brunch around noon. We got to sit down in the patio which was nice and cool and we had the spectacular bellagio water show view to enjoy. The mimosas were delicious and the French baguette hit the spot. Would love to eat here again.
0,"This place is was not that great. Dim sum is outranglusly expensive for what it is ranging from \""that's kinda expensive\"" to \""wtf? That's it for that price???!\"",and the cart was only offered once....I thought they are suppose continuously come with more options....\n\nBut at least you get an option to choose entrees from a menu, offering dishes from other Asian menus (Vietnamese, tiawaneese...) me and my boyfriend ordered the minced pork meat over rice (only because so many reviews said it was great), it just tasted \""bleh,\"" and makes me leave thinking \""I should have just gone to get McD\""\n\nThe best part of my meal was the ice latt\u00e9 my boyfriend got me next door"
0,"Horrible place to stay in. Bottom of the barrel, cheap but at what cost? This hotel lacks security and needs to be sanitized. It should be demolished and rebuilt. On Friday someone broke in to our room and stole my friends wallet while we were sleeping. We woke up and chased him but he got away. He had access to the cleaning personals master key. The hotel did nothing for us after we lost 800 doll rs to their faulty security systems. No cameras but the one in the elevator. Spend the extra 10 doll rs and stay somewhere else."
0,This place is disgusting. It tastes like they soak everything in margarine. Avoid at all costs.
0,Apparently they don't like to work on Saturdays.  I came here twice on Saturdays and both times they posted a sign on the door--closed.
1,"It has become a tradition for my bf and I to eat at Trevi each time we go to Vegas.  The food is pretty good, the service is spotty but it's just the cutest place and we love it!  Way better than a lot of the other more expensive places we've been to in the area."
0,"I wish I had read the poor reviews on Yelp before getting my car washed here. First, the positives:\n\n1 Star - Price was reasonable. $18.99 for the Works and $3 off with student ID! I didn't have any problem with employees pushing for upsells. The cashier explained their $60 for $120 worth of basic washes as a Black Friday special. I politely declined and she was very pleasant throughout the transaction.\n\n1 Star - The waiting area is nice, equipped with TVs playing sporting events.\n\nMinus 1 Star - As nice as the waiting area is, I didn't want to sit there for a half hour without anyone telling me my car was ready. A man would periodically come in and call people by name or their car model so I assumed they would do the same for me. I was wrong. Apparently, they were only calling people who were getting detail work done. Finally I got up and looked out the window and saw my car parked way on the other side of the lot. I went up to the cashier and asked her if they were going to tell people when their car was ready because I had just been sitting there for 30+ minutes. She turned to an employee who had come in to cash in her tips and told her they should be calling out the cars. I didn't wait for the cashier to respond to me and walked out.\n\nMinus 1 Star - Exterior: There was grease on one of my hubcaps and near the wheel well! What the heck! I'm going to have to get a towel and clean where they screwed up. \n\nMinus 1 Star - Interior: As soon as I got into my car it smelled horrible. They clearly did not put any air freshener that was supposed to come with my wash in there because it smelled very strongly of an unpleasant soap or detergent. Yuck. Also, my biggest pet peeve about car washes, they did a poor job of cleaning the center console/cup holder area. Still sticky with soda residue. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend and I will not be back. My search for a decent carwash continues..."
1,"This was definitely the best Indian food I've had in a long while. Went with some coworkers while at a conference and was impressed with the dish selection, descriptions to aid some of the folks in the group who hadn't had much Indian food, and the helpful service. In a sea of glitz and glamour on the strip, this was a refreshing winner!"
0,The is probably one the worst places to eat.  \n\nAs i walked into this place I assumed it was going to be a good resturant to eat at.  The resturant was big and clean.  \n\nMy family of 4 ordered 3 Pho Dac Biet and one Bun Chao Tom (grilled shimp past with noodles).  When our Pho came out it was warm.  It wasn't hot enough to cook the raw meat then put on top of pho.   The worst part of the meal was when the Bun Chao Tom.   As we were slicing into the meat we discovery that it was still cold.  We were completely disgusted at this point.  We paid and left.  We will never return to this place again.
0,"This school is disgusting, I had to remove my children from this school as they were constantly sick and missing more days than they were there. The positive responses are from staff members by the way....."
1,Came in to eat late at night and they had a variety of Buffalo wings. I can't believe there were so many types. I was looking for Buffalo Wild Wings and the hotel had a list of place to eat and I stumble upon this place. Very good wings.
0,"If you want a good (and I mean GREAT) cheesesteak in Vegas, pass up Pops and land yourself at one of the many Capriotti's. I've had a few Cap's sammies ($8 medium cheesesteaks with mushrooms and peppers) - amazing. Drove by Pop's mid-Saturday. Was starving so decided to try it out. $10 later, I was bummed. The shrooms were canned and tasted like it. Yuk. The meat was dry. I had the provelone on top, still not a moist sammy. Wished it had been a Capriotti's. One star for being 24-hrs."
1,"I am so grateful that my family was invited to stay here for the soft opening! Our room was beautiful. I especially loved the vanity and the hair flat iron by Mui. The T.V. had some issues with freezing, but all in all, I enjoyed my stay. The service here was amazing as well. Everyone greeted us with a friendly smile and always held onto a conversation. I felt comfortable and there was never an awkward moment. The Cromwell is definitely going to be one of my favorite hotels to stay at."
1,"My wife was craving for something different so we decided to try this place. Everything was EXCELLENT!!\n\nOur waitress did an above and beyond service. I'm not really familiar with European dishes - she made a few suggestions and warned us that the dishes are Very, very large. (Me and my wife are small plus we are trying to eat less....). We decided to go for the Paella Barcelona and split it. Oh..it came with a corn chowder soup. \n\nOur food came and we would not believe it!! Extremely LARGE! We started to go at it and it was very delicious. We took our sweet time depositing it into our tummy...Couldn't save room for desserts...During the meal, we felt like we had our own personal waitress. \n\nHere is what we thought:\nFood -    A+++\nService - A+++\nPrice -     A+++\n\nI will have some out of towners visiting next month... I'll definitely bring them here!"
0,"Well, at least the owner is consistent.  As with Roka Akor, this place had great style in the decor, but the food just was not very good.  We ordered chicken tikka masala and a curry.  Both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced, but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries.  It almost tasted like the curry was cooked in one pot, the meat was boiled in water and the meat was dropped into the curry at the last minute.  Maybe its the old school in me, but its such a waste to order a meat dish and leave the meat behind.  The search continues for good Indian food in my hood..."
1,"Fantastic, romantic ambiance. Attentive service. Wonderful food. Bonaparte was a great choice for a date with my husband."
1,"Last weekend we went to the Ice Den with my nephew and niece.  They were having Holiday ice skating for $10 a person for 2 hours.  It was a pretty big Ice Skating rink and the staff was dress up as Rudolph and Frosty.  We all had a great time.   If you are looking for a place to go Ice Skating,  you should check out Ice Den in Scottsdale."
1,I am pleased to recommend EVDC. Everyone was very helpful and professional. PA Julie took the time to answer all my questions and explain in detail the procedures that were being done.
0,"I purchased a Groupon deal for this groomer, they sold out of the small dog size deal and instead I purchased a medium size, thinking it wouldn't make a difference. I call to double check if it's ok to use this groupon to get my dog groomed when they tell me that they cannot honor it because of the fact that my dog is small and the groupon says it's for a medium-size dog. In my opinion it should not matter if I paid a little extra for medium-size groom when my dog is actually a small dog, I am very upset that I was not able to use this coupon because they made a big deal about it! I will make sure to let my contacts know to avoid this company and to go elsewhere because it doesn't make any sense as to why they wouldn't want to make money doing a small dog groom and me paying for a medium size groom price. It's very disappointing that they won't be getting any money from me!"
0,I have ordered pizza from here a couple of times to be delivered. The last pizza I got I ordered the thin and crispy crust. The only thing they got right was the thin. You could not even hold a piece of pizza in your hand because it was so floppy. I will not be ordering from there again. I should have picked up a pizza from Papa Murphy's and baked it myself. It would've tasted better and been a lot cheaper!
1,"Dr. Sotelo is a Buckeye's fan, how can you go wrong here?  \n\nBeside being from the same area in the Midwest as Dr. Sotelo I have been taking our children here for several years.  We have always been treated well by the staff and Dr. Sotelo.  There is hardly any issues with scheduling an appointment and they don't make you wait forever in the waiting room or the exam room.\n\nI saw Dr. Cannon for the firstime on my last visit there and was pleased with his evaluation and treatment of my daughters issues."
0,The food was all right. But the service was horrible.  We went there with a group of 16 for my sister's 30th birthday. It was fine when we first got there but one of our people was in a wheelchair and thus made the night worse. First they wouldn't out a short 4 top in the section by the long high top(where we were). Then the manager refused to put enough tables together as we needed to keep them for other guests.  We were all eating and drinking.  No one was just sitting drinking water. So it was horribly awkward. The waitress was slow and inefficient. We got drinks one at a time and food was so slow some people finished before the others had their wings. No one knew where ye food went though the server wrote in order what we wanted. Meals were messed up. But worst of all we had to go to the bar to refill our water and sweet tea because NO ONE would come refill our glasses. The manager made us unwelcome though we spent hundreds of dollars. It was my first and last trip to this place. No thank you.
1,"I visited this bar a couple of weekends ago. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the drink menu is interesting. The selection for cocktails is interesting and my boyfriend was impressed at the selection of liquors they had. Our server was prompt and attentive, and the drinks came out quickly. The only downfall to my visit was the noise. It is a very small place and there was a group of 13 celebrating a birthday. It was really loud so I had a hard time talking to my boyfriend across the small table. There's really nothing you can do about that though! We ended up only staying for one drink but it was nice to try this place for the first time. We will be back."
1,I love it here! Their gas is super cheap and they have they BEST customer service I have ever seen at a gas station. It's impeccably CLEAN and organized!
0,"Good location right next to Walmart, it really wasn't that packed for a Sunday afternoon. We were seated quick and easy with no hassle. Our server Michael was really good; he knew a great deal of the menu and was responsible enough to make sure all our needs were meet and was really good with the kids. Our server was very lenient with us and our order; cheerful happy and professional. I had biscuits and gravy blueberry pancakes and a steak omelet; I know I'm a fatty!! Lol!!  We sat near the kitchen and staff was a bit loud and lots of plates and glasses rattling and banging around.Yet I sort of lost my appetite the place needs a serious remodel and cleaning. The booth back splash had coffee stains and crayon marking all over the wall which made me look around a bit more. The wall just above us was covered in a thick layer of dust like nobody cleaned these wall in months and the vent just above us was dirty as well covered in thick black mold. This is all pretty scary sitting with my food just above all this dust and mold. Place has potential but they need to clean up their act, better yet just clean up.  Our server MICHAEL WAS GOOD!! You can be extremely great somewhere else!!"
0,"Poor service.. If I call to make an appointment and you tell me that would be ok, and I confirm with you multiple times I would expect to have a appointment. I walk in just for you to tell me it's going to be at least a 45 minute wait and theres 6 people ahead of me ...why wasn't I informed of this on the phone????? Why tell me it's best to make a appointment then???Poor customer service! I understand your a busy nail shop, but I don't appreciate driving clear across town for awful customer service."
1,Usual layout. Staff was friendly.
0,"This was the worst buffet experience of my life!! My family of 6 and I went out to eat at 7:00 on a Wednesday and the place stunk even before we walked in, but we bravely walked in. Then were hit by a pungent fish odor and were a little wary but still wanted to eat!!! So we got our plates and then aimlessly began walking around looking at ALL of the dried out meats and sparsely filled trays. Everything we tried tasted like it has been sitting there for hours. We tried to fill our plates but everything we tried was horrible. All 4 of my kids hated all of their food and they are NOT picky eaters! It was there request to go to Chinese. After everyone was tired of being disappointed by the food choices and sending back full plates of food. We tried to get some ice cream.. OH MY GOSH --- I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO GROSSED OUT!!! The \""Scoop\"" for the ice cream had mold on it and was attached to the wall sitting in a bowl of brown ice cream water. SO DISGUSTING!!! I asked to waitress to please bring us a new \""scoop\"" and she brought us a spoon to get our ice cream out of the 20 gallon buckets.. A soup spoon people.... So when I walked up with my almost $80.00 bill and told them how unhappy I was with there food, service, and cleanliness of their establishment. The offered me 10 percent off lol or they would call 911--- I let them call 911 because someone was going to have to force me to pay for something I would not give to my neighbors dog....... WHICH THEY DID!! They called the police on my family (remember we have 4 children) because we did not want to pay for the worst eating experience I have ever had. DO NOT EAT HERE!!"
1,"!Hola meego! That's the enthusiastically friendly greeting everybody gets at this fun little Mexican restaurant. The decor matches the enthusiasm of the staff well: bright colors (even for a Mexican restaurant) are everywhere and everything intangible about this place is bouncing off the walls cheery. I guess its not a coincidence its called \""The Party\"".\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu of all the expected classic dishes, plus many that you might not expect. I ordered the \""Ceviche Mexicano\"" with chopped (cooked) Tilapia and shrimp in a very lively light lime sauce over tostadas with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, onions and other good stuff like beans, rice cheese, etc. I liked it a lot. The lady had very good Burritos Suizos, which were far too big to finish. Prices were $10 or less per entree. Good fried tortilla chips with salsa were gratis.\n\nThe highlight of the meal were the (Friday night special) 27 ounce Margaritas for $5.95 each. Dont bother with the math. This is by far the best Margarita deal I have ever come across in this town or any other en los Estados Unidos. No, I didn't drive home.\n\nI can't review this place without one more mention of the fact that everybody working here is just so damn nice. As our meal was winding down, no fewer than 5 staff members asked us how everything was. Any server/busser coming within 3 tables of us checked our table to see if we needed anything, every single time.\n\nLa Fiesta is not fine dining. However, it is a superlative casual dining Mexican restaurant and delivers incredible value and I can't wait to go back."

1,This place has the best happy hour ever. I highly recommend the pork nachos. They are delicious and a steal at happy hour. The atmosphere is fun but can be a little loud.  The open layout is nicely done though.
0,"I have to say I was not impressed, walked in on a Sunday, wasn't greeted by anyone, didn't even know if they were open, no selection to choose from. No thanks."
1,"My boyfriend and I had a groupon for this restaurant. We wanted to try this place for a first time. When we got there, we were welcomed and seated in a booth (we had a view of Las Vegas, it's a plus). They put a brown bag  in the table and when I opened the bag, it was two pieces of bread. I tried it, it was warm and soft and then someone came to my table and brought some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Bread + Balsamic vinegar and oil = delicious.    \n\nFor appetizer, we order Calamari Fritti. It was good, it has a lot flavor but it was a little greasy. The calamari was crunchy and easy to eat. The serving for the calamari is pretty decent.\n \nFor our entree, I ordered Linguine alla Vongole (clams and linguine w/ your choice of red or white sauce) and my boyfriend ordered Lobster Ravioli. My linguine alla vongole was so good. It has a lot of flavor and there was a lot of clams in my dish. My boyfriend also like his food. I asked my bf if I could have a little taste of it. The lobster ravioli was good and it has a lot of flavor but I didn't really taste the lobster, I would rather stick with what I had ordered.   \n\nThe server and the service at this place was excellent. I would come back again!"
0,"Ordered a blizzard at the drive thru. They put lids in everything at this location and put the entire order in a bag, so you don't see your ice cream until you have left the window. My blizzard was underfilled, and runny, and not what I ordered."
1,"So far this is the best pizza I've ever had.  I really like thin crust NY style and this is definitely it.\n\nThe place can be found on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan Hotel, right by the exit from Marquee.\n\nThe best IMO is the white pizza...I tried the mushroom and it was just OK.  It's $4 a slice which is reasonable, if you think it's a rip-off what the hell are you doing at the Cosmo in the first place??"
0,"If you are needing to get your perscriptions filled quickly and professionally, you might want to pick another location.\n\nThey are very busy, but slow, and relatively indifferent to their customers.\n\nThey made it far more of a hassle than it should have been, as I waited 45 minutes after the 35 minutes they initially said it would take to fill my order."
0,This place has awful service. We had to ask for a beer menu which the hostess had trouble locating. Hello it's a tap house. Anyway no one came to the table to say we'll be right with you so we finally walked out. Told the hostess and she say oh sorry. \nNever going back.
1,"I love this place! The Meatball sandwich is great and so are all the pastas. Completely authentic and not gross like a cheapy Italian Restaurant.\nEverything is good from the bread, to the meatballs, to the side salad. Order the half portion or full portion of all their menu items and it will not disappoint. Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!"
1,"Good place for Vegetarians, they have a bountiful vegetarian course with many plates offering every type of salad, vegetable, yogurt and cheese dish you could imagine. All are very fresh and will feed at least 2-3 people. The chicken shwarma is pretty amazing as well."
0,"This place is disgusting!!!!! First off its not an authentic japanese place, the waiteress was nice , she did very well on knowing the menu but the food sucks. I didnt get to try the sushi becuz there were no more and seriously if your a restaurant always have extra food instead of running out. My drink was disgusting also I order a pineapple cocktail and it tasted like ginger( i dont like ginger), then I ordered a different drink kiwi and pineapple cocktail but it tasted like dishwashing soap ewww the waitress said it was how the recipe is. The shrimp tempura was good which I had as an appetizer but my fuji apple salmon entree was disturbing because the salmon tasted like it wasnt clean and the mash potatoes tasted like it was spoiled. I didnt even borther with dessert I just wanted to leave. My friend on the other hand enjoyed her ginger cocktail which was suppose to b pineapple and she enjoyed her filet (beef filet with mashed potatoes) she gets a side eye from me becuz who eats beef at a japanese restaurant.  After spending $67 buck each I was quiet disappointed in this fake Japanese spot. The next day my stomach was still upset from eating there. Thats a whole night n day n half with upset stomach.:-X"
0,"I recently went to Orange Sky for the first time for my birthday. I had talked to friends about where we should go for a nice dinner, and after talking about Flemings, Maestro's City Hall, and Ruth's Chris, we decided to try something a little more original.\n\nSo we show up about a half hour before our reservation for cocktails, and the bar is absolutely beautiful. Not only is the bar modern and gorgeous, but the bartender is well dressed and attentive. We had a few Vesper martini's and Maker's Manhattan's that were great cocktails to say the least, but the balcony and windows allow you to look over the valley from the 15th floor of the Talking Stick Resort.\n\nAfter my friends had arrived, we decided to head into the dining room. Just like the bar, the dining room was modern and relaxed. We got seated and our server came over. He told us that he'd be taking care of us and asked who was having a birthday. My friends mentioned that it was my birthday and he wished me a happy birthday.\n\nHe noted that we brought our drinks from the bar, to which one of my friends replied \""yes, but the ladies of our group need something\"", he responded \""On that note, I'll be right back\"".\n\nThat was the first sour taste in our mouths. We then asked about the oysters, our server was only able to tell us the name of the oysters, and knew nothing about them. When we asked what kind of flavor the had, he only responded \""medium\"" and then told us they were very \""fresh\"".\n\nWhile we ate our appetizers, we asked for another round of Vespers. We enjoyed the oysters, lobster risotto, and a couple of small salads. About 15 minutes into our appetizers, our server returned to ask us what was in a Vesper Martini because he wasn't sure how to ring it in. We told him that he could probably ask the bartender, because frankly we weren't sure how to respond.\n\nDinner came out, and the majority of us had steaks, one of my friends had the seabass and another with the porkchop. I also had a couple of friends order a side of bacon wrapped scallop and prawn. While most of the food was excellent, I asked for my steak as rare as possible. When I ask for a steak prepared as rare as possible, I want it to be a little cool in the middle. So either, the steak was prepared improperly, or more likely it sat in the window too long and warmed up.\n\nWe finished our dinner, and our server got the plates out of the way. He brought me a birthday dessert that looked tasted fantastic. He asked us if there was anything else we needed, we told him no and he left us the bill. After about 20 minutes of waiting for him to return so we could pay, we had to go look for him.\n\nAnother server came back with out bills and set them in front of the men of the table. A few of them were supposed to go to the ladies and the waitress said \""I'm sorry, I assumed that the men were paying\"" in what I considered to be a rather rude tone.\n\nAll in all, the food was pretty good but the service was so bad that the experience was mostly ruined. With better service, the restaurant could be greatly improved."
0,J'ai mang\u00e9 le plat du jour; un plat de p\u00e2tes trop cuites avec de l'eau au fond de l'assiette quelques pilons de poulet et morceaux de chorizo qui semblaient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 bouillis. Le tout couronn\u00e9 de morceaux de carottes et pois surgel\u00e9s. 16$ avant taxes et pourboire! Ex\u00e9crable!
0,"Meh Greek Restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad.  It was no Z's Greek on Indian School, but it wasn't bad.\n\nI had the Gyro Platter.  The Greek salad was fine, the gyro was fine although I prefer it done a bit more.  The rice was ok and the veggies on the side...they tasted ok but here's where they dropped from 3 stars down to 2.  There were parts of the broccoli and such that were not normally meant for mammals lacking multiple stomach's.  Numerous tough, fiberous bites that had to be spit out or regurgitated to chew on later, as you wish.\n\nThe service was friendly and the people were nice. If I hadn't been in a hurry I might have sent it back or changed to a different side."
0,Everything is way too greasey for my taste!
0,"This has been my all time favorite restaurant anywhere for years, since I lived here in very early 2000s, but this time it was a disappointment.\n\nThey didn't have the usual Cuban Bread on the menu but they said they could make it anyway... but it wasn't at all the same.  They used a different bread that was way too thick and not even toasted.\n\nI got the bacon and cheese burger but the burger wasn't very good, I didn't finish it.  The fries were just blah."
0,"\""Authentic Mexican Food\"" seems to be a complete lie here. I feel like Taco Bell is more authentic than Espo's. 2 Stars, because the Carne Asada Taco Salad I got was nothing but a bowl of lettuce, a few chips, and small balls of Carne Asada every once in awhile. They took over 30 minutes to deliver our order. (There was only about 5 people in the entire restaurant, 3 of which were already eating.) Then, they got our orders wrong, and also charged us extra to put something that was already included in the salad on the side. Only good thing: The Salsa, and the Bowl it came in."
1,"There are two Uncle Sam's that I know of (and no, I am not talking about UNCLE SAM as in Big Brother!) and the one on Shea and 32nd street is the best.  I have eaten at the much larger restaurant on Shea and 92nd in Scottsdale, and IMHO, it lacks character.  The service at 32nd street is exceptional, and very, very fast (even when packed).  The food is good, with ample portions.  The only negative is that if you want french fries you have to order them as a side.  I think this is a shame, because while they are tasty -- they simply add a lot of extra $$ to the end of your bill.  Overall, my favorite choice there is the calzone (which has cheese and spinach inside).  I like that I can get a mini calzone and take half of it home and eat it for lunch the next day.  Tip:  go early for best seating.  Large parties are difficult, but they do a good job of seating you in the back.  Crowded at lunch and dinner."
0,"I stayed at the SLS during opening weekend and everything was fantastic but this place is a FAIL! Although the service is excellent and they are open late (which is perfect for those late night noodle cravings) the food is just not good, in fact its horrible.  Go to the Griddle next door instead, you won't be disappointed."
0,The pizza was good at one time...... what happened? \nThis is the saltiest stuff I ever ate.............did the chef change about 8 years ago....  and show up with nothing more than a salt shaker..... the only thing you taste is salt......... I know it is the sauce.... so everything must be this salty.........maybe that cookie is good..... Is that salty too?????\ndefinitely pass on this one...... yuck.......
1,"This is a new establishment.  I love Mexican food and this place did not disappoint.   The chips and salsa are great.  Try the green salsa.  Ivan, the owner, says\nits his wife family recipe.  It is great.  The service and servers are very nice and welcoming.  Only knock is they do not serve beer yet.  Hopefully soon.   Try this restaurant.  Very good."
1,"On a whim went in with no idea what to expect. The exterior lacks the pizazz of some of the neighboring buildings but once inside I was elated to find a sea of steaming basins. The selection is enormous. And the quality very impressive. Much better food quality than most giant buffets I have dined in. \n\nThere is plenty of American food, and even some tacos, for those inclined. For me it was all about the clams, egg foo yung, dumplings, beef and broccoli, steamed flounder, crayfish, and soups. \n\nI look forward to coming back with some serious munchies and more time. The desserts look awesome."
1,"Dined last night with my wife and we decided that this has got to be the best AUCE buffet in Pittsburgh.  \n\nWe've been to Wu's Old Country Buffet (wife got sick from there), Hokkaido (food was decent, crabs were perfect, but sushi rolls tasted like they were prepared hours and maybe days ahead of time), Grandview at Rivers Casino (great deal for half price- Monday thru Thursday thru the end of February, IF you want to wait in a huge line)...\n\nBut Misaki is the new 'Best in the Burgh'.  The sushi and rolls were as fresh as could be.  They only make 2 at a time and replenish when they run low.  Their crab legs were done just right and just as good as Hokkaido, they had split lobsters on the buffet (no additional charge) with some sort of cream sauce on top (Hollandaise?) that were good but I wish they would have just brioled the tail, They had Lobster claws that look awesome but not the came consistency as crab claws...  They had cold shrimp that were huge with the shells already removed, cold crab legs if you like that, cold spiced salmon...  And on and on and on...  \n\nPrices are similar to Hokkaido, quality is much better...  \n\nDo yourselves a favor and if you're in the mood for an Asian Buffet, give Misaki a shot- you won't be disappointed!"
0,"Ce ne sont pas les restos Salvadorien qui manquent dans ce quartier et celui-ci sans \u00eatre d\u00e9cevant, est largement surrestim\u00e9 et ne se compare par \u00e0 El Chalateco sur Beaubien par exemple."
1,"Having walked about 30 minutes in the wrong direction absentmindedly, I completed my long hike to Bouillon Bilk. In Montreal for a conference, it was dinner for 1, with my trusty friends The New Yorker and The Economist my only companions. I was delighted to find that the restaurant has seating along both sides of the large central bar, ideal for the lone rangers among us. \n\nThe decor is unpretentious and minimalist without being sterile. The use of high and low tables helps make the dining room dynamic. For its small scale, it has a sense of theatre. \n\nMy server, Naomi, was lovely and attentive. As she explained the specials it became clear that this is a restaurant that constructs dishes with many elements-- varied ingredients, garnishes, sauces-- it all sounded very ambitious. \n\nI ordered the duck, with cherries, brown rice, snow peas, a mustard reduction, and topped with seared foie gras. On the side I ordered a special of various Quebecois mushrooms, apparently in season. \n\nSome hearty country-style bread and an excellent local Pilsner tied me over until the main courses arrived. \n\nTo get to the point, the food was excellent. Better executed, more satisfying, and more delicious than most similarly \""ambitious\"" eateries in New York. With all the things happening on the plate, every bite was so well balanced-- savory and sweet in a killer combination. \n\nDessert was also on point. They kindly accommodated my request for a simple bowl of ice cream-- scoops of both homemade sesame and coffee flavors, at once delicate and rich. And as Naomi explained, the chef couldn't just send out two scoops ungarnished, so the bowl had little pansy petals sprinkled on top. \n\nI highly recommend the restaurant for those who want to instantly confirm that Montreal is a city with a serious and apparently thriving food culture. And importantly, aside from the food, the atmosphere is convivial and relaxed. \n\nIt was worth the hike."
0,"I know, I know...it's heresy to dis Wholey's in Pittsburgh....I can't help it, though.  The smell when you walk through those doors turns me off immediately.  A fish store should NOT smell like decaying fish!  Maybe I'm spoiled from the time I spent in MD and all the truly fresh fish in clean fish stores that don't stink   In a pinch, I'll pick up what I need, but it's worth the extra step to hit Benkovitz on Smallman.  Benkovitz is clean and smells like a fish store should....it DOESN'T smell."
0,I feel like i'm the only person who didn't like this place.\n\nMy sister is a huge fan and went with me to order.  I had the Jade Chicken.\n\nBleh.   I tasted her food too but I don't recall what it was--still bleh.\n\nI'll stick with the 'berto brothers for my bad mexican food.  \n\nMaybe I just don't like asian food?
1,"It's always a little nerve-wracking to book vendors sight unseen, but after reading numerous positive reviews, I felt confident booking with Amelia C & Co. From booking to the day of, Amelia C & crew were so easy to work with. They accommodated multiple changes I needed (adding/removing bridesmaids who wanted services, changing start time), and were gracious in doing so!\n\nThe morning of the wedding, Amelia & an intern came to our hotel room, and got to work setting up right away. Even after not having done a trial hair & makeup session, my hair & makeup turned out even better than I had imagined! I'm not a big makeup person on a normal day, and Amelia understood exactly what I wanted and made me feel glamorous. \n\nMy makeup stayed through a very teary ceremony & reception, and even through the Vegas club after party. I am so happy with how I looked in pictures--beautiful, but still with my own style coming through. And of course, my bridesmaids looked amazing too! I would recommend Amelia & Co to any bride!"
0,What happened to this place? We have been here quite a few times and this last visit will probably be the last. We had bad service from the get go. No one sat us right away the servers were walking by looking at us but no host came. I had trouble finding anything on the menu that on a hot day in phoenix sounded good. Everything is pricey too for being so-so food. Salads are $10 and up. A trip to the bathroom grossed me out with greasy smudged hand prints all over the black stall doors. Walking back I noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food. Our little boy dropped something under our table and let's just say they can keep it because it was filthy under there. \nNo more rock bottom for us!
1,"Best Chicken Shawarama in town hands down.  I like pita jungle and some of the other local places that are similar but for pure food taste and quality, this is the best in town."
1,"Just had a late lunch and a beer today. Food was very very good! Wings and burger and fries were delish! Waitress acted like it was her first day. Maybe it was? KNOW YOUR BEERS if you're a server, study the menu or write it down and put it in your pocket! All in all we will go back for the food!"
1,Good fish & chips. Highly recommend the Cajun seasoning. Right on a busy road where you'd almost miss it but it's a little spot worth a visit.
1,"This is the place to come and experience Edinburgh's seasons:\n\nAutumn: brown, yellow, orange, piles of colourful leaves which glimmer in the weakening Autumnal sun. Children in wellies, running through said piles of leaves. Families determined to enjoy the last remaining warmth of the year.\n\nWinter: everywhere else the snow has melted, here the grass is not to be seen, it is disguised as a white blanket. There are footsteps, people are creating snow angels, snow men. The trees are bare. The joggers are not put off by the cold, they keep going anyway. There is a sun, yet it provides little warmth, instead a crisp and bitter cold which numbs your fingers. When there is no snow, this is relatively deserted, people only cross it to get somewhere else.\n\nSpring: You know it's Spring when you feel like you're not going to die of pneumonia without that winter coat. It's sunny, the sun is still low in the sky, yet everyone is out and about. People are playing tennis, rugby, the Morningside mums are out with their prams, a old German sheep dog just dragged a table and some chairs all the way down the from the quater mile, a Business man leaped up in the air to avoid being run over. People are attempting to do summery things, picnics are being carried out, though all participants look like they are doing it because someone put a gun to their head. The most noticeable thing? The meadows are covered in colourful Spring flowers, yellow and purple are the most striking. People seem genuinely relieved that the days are getting longer.\n\nSummer: End of the exams, the start of the holiday season: hope, energy, a love of life. These are all to be found around the meadows at this time of year. The play park is in full working action, children and young adults alike use the swings, roundabouts and precarious looking see-sore. Some queue up with their parents outside the ice cream van to get mr Whippys or candyfloss. If people are not playing sports, they are having BBQs. There is a lot of smoke and that familiar smell of sizzling food. The weather doesn't often get this good, so people show off their summer dresses and pretty sandals as best they can.\n\n\nTo top if all off, you have a view of the castle on one side, Arthur's seat on another. The University touches one part, and the wonderful areas of Newington, Bruntsfield, Tolcross and Marchmont surround the rest."
1,My best and I tried the Margherita pizza w/ the Mister Mister. -- Couldn't go wrong. I'm a fan!
1,Ate here the other day for breakfast and oh my was it wonderful. Had the Dali and my boyfriend had the gypsy. They both were amazing. And it's very hard to impress him and he loved it. We will be going back for sure.

0,"My daughter had suggested we stop in here for dinner one night after her friends had told her it was \""good pizza\"".  We ordered a pizza and some mozzarella sticks at the counter and had a seat.  After waiting a bit, we watched our mozzarella sticks get delivered to another table.  They quickly acknowledged their mistake but didn't bother to apologize.  Brought us another order fairly quickly... maybe too quickly as they weren't cooked all the way and were soggy and gross.  The pizza didn't fair much better.  I'm pretty sure everything is frozen not fresh. We left after only a few bites.  Not at all impressed and we won't be back."
1,"Was quite surprised to enjoy a very tasty carne asada torta the other day. It came with hot and tasty fries, too. Good sandwich!"
0,"the food was good, but not great. the horchata; however, is one of the best i've ever tried. i could come back just for that. \n\nthe real reason why this place gets 2 stars instead of 3 was how the manager dealt with our issue. my friend ordered the filet mignon taco plate and the menu clearly said it was 15.99. We got our bill and it says 21.99. So we asked why and she said it's because they changed the menu. Well.. not the 4 menus that we were given. Instead of fixing it, she argued with us and tried to find a menu with the new price. when she couldn't produce one, she said she would need to call the owner blah blah. seriously?! and then she takes another 15minutes talking on the phone with the owner, I'm assuming, instead of dealing with her waiting customers. left such a bad taste in my mouth. in the end, she changed the charge to 15.99, to which i left a $6 tip and a scathing note on how they can have their money back. we will never return to this place."
0,"menu is fairly lacking, even for an irish pub, and a bit overpriced, but maybe they have to be to make the rent...although they seem to make it up in booze sales.  staff was a bit rude and non-existant at times, but not much else around hre for irish pubs.  the guiness was good, but hard to screw that up I guess!"
1,"Items Selected:\n\nMargherita Slice\nGarlic Knot\n\n...with my opinions on traditional New York \""slice shops\"" varying from terrible to merely decent but having found some improvement in the style since relocating to Las Vegas, largely as a result of superior ingredient quality at both \""Secret Pizza\"" and Pop-Up, it was with cautious optimism that I approached the newly minted Strip-side Pin Up Pizza at pH's Miracle Mile Shops for a late afternoon bite.  Truly a \""slice shop\"" featuring a small counter with standing room only dining both inside and out plus a half-dozen pies served by a staff of four including two servers, a cashier, and a pizzaiolo hand-tossing gargantuan crusts it was to warm smiles and pleasantries that I was greeted and taking my time to peruse the options and inquire what was most fresh an order was placed - a seemingly steep $6.76 after tax, but on closer inspection a price well justified by a baseball sized garlic knot and locally sourced heirloom tomatoes on what I'd argue to be the city's best electric (or gas for that matter) crust, though purists may beg to differ given a lack of \""foldability\""...or perhaps \""fold-necessity\"" as relates to greasy, flavorless 'tradition.'  Subtle with semolina but largely a lightly yeasted flour base with just enough spring and char to support the ingredient weight from rim to a center approximately one foot away suffice it to say that single slices at Pin Up will eat like a meal to some, but with dollops of fresh mozzarella playing against fresh sliced tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil on such an impressive backbone with only pre-filled $3 cannolis for dessert I'd say that's just fine...besides, knowing what I know now I rather wish I'd have stuck around to try a slice of the housemade pepperoni with shredded fresh mozzarella and hand crushed tomato sauce instead of schlepping to MGM for dessert anyhow."
0,"I wasn't too impressed with Goldilocks Bake Shop when it comes to service and even their food.  Visited here a couple of times in the last year.  Normally, these visits are a request by my mom when she's in town.  She doesn't complain much, but could tell she's never really satisfied with the food.  As for me, I always feel like I am inconveniencing the employees here just by walking in and having them ring me up.  Simple Hello, Thank You, or even a smile would have brought my rating to at least a 3.  \n\nMy most recent visit was for some freshly baked Pan De Sal.  Guess What??  No can do.  Once I walked in I just realized that I wasn't at Valerio's where they sell fresh Pan De Sal.  No fresh Pan De Sal also means no freshly made Filipino Pastries.  I ended up getting a Ensaymada just so I can give them a little business.  \n\nAlso...no credit/debit if purchases are less than $10.  Just happens to be the day I forgot to hit the ATM.  No problem.  I found enough spare change in my car to make my purchase. \n\nI've been to Goldilocks in Vallejo, San Jose, and San Diego.  Never an issue at those locations.  I will probably not go out of my way to come back.  But if mom is in town and she wants Pinoy food, then I guess I have no choice."
0,"Why ask people to bring their \""VIP\"" tickets at 8:15pm if you're not going to let anyone in until after 9pm?\n\nLA Comedy club wasn't on the directory so we had to ask several employees where the club was. We purchased groupons that said to bring your VIP ticket between 8:15-9:00. We arrived at 8:20 and there were no employees anywhere and the club was closed. There was a make shift line of random customers with the same confusion. We left and came back at 8:45. There at least was now an employee who told us that it didn't open for another 20 minutes. We went to go lean against the wall to wait and found out if we hadn't left we would have been first in line as that was where the line started. About 7 people had filled in so we weren't that far back but I the employee did her job with information we could have been first.\n\nThe groupon said front row, we asked to be sat in the front row - we were sat two rows back - even though there were no people in the front row yet - when that row was occupied, it was because they were seated well after we were. The row we were in did not have tables or anything to lean on - only every other row had tables. Definitely not VIP seats.\n\nI would not recommend this cluster-F of a \""comedy club\"" nor will I come back.\n\n**********UPDATE***********\nI left the original review during the 45 minute wait for the show to start. After the show, I was accosted by the host who sat me. He apologized for not hearing me ask for the front row. Then asked me to prove to him that groupon listed front row seating because it didn't say it anywhere on the paper. He did this IN FRONT OF EVERYONE LEAVING - I was horrified. It was like he had zero customer service experience ever. So I pulled up the groupon page on my phone (something he could have done himself after reading my review) and showed him. He physically took my phone out of my hands to show it to the owner - again like he couldn't just pull up the page himself later. The owner looked like he couldn't care less. The host had told me he wanted to resolve the issue. I guess in his mind it was resolved - now that I proved I wasn't lying. And sent me on my way with an apology. If I could give a zero star review I would. Now instead of never going back, I'm going to tell EVERYONE about my shitty experience and make sure no-one else has to waste their money on LA Comedy Club!"

1,"My friends and I booked a shooting time at 10:30 am for 7/13/14.  We had such a great time!  We were picked up from our hotel on time and shuttled to the range in a matter of minutes.  We then were checked in and led to fire at the range. \n   The four of us all chose to get the Gamer's Experience for $190 each.  One member of our party added on the M249 SAW to the package for an additional $100.  It might seem expensive, but you have to realize that ammo is costly these days and most of these guns are impossible to shoot anywhere else in the country, especially if you live in California.  The M249 SAW is impossible to buy and is probably worth $100,000.\n   The employees at MGV were professional and courteous.  No one here looks down on you or treats you as an inferior if you don't know much about guns.  They are patient with newbies, explain how to hold the firearm safely and give you time to take pictures with the guns and your targets.  \n\nI loved it and look forward to doing something like this again!"
1,"I love the dessert here! Got the coffee ice cream and taro red bean ice cream! The server was a male and he was very welcoming. It is a nice hangout spot. A spot to finish paperwork, or homework, or just go on a date or hang with friends. Very cool as well because games like uno, scrabble, checkers, etc are there for you to play for free! And theyre open late on weekends.#"
1,"It is said the chimichanga was invented at this spot. Full-on bar and dance floor, banquet rooms, and large dining areas. \n\nI cannot believe after several years of yelp*ing and many more than that Macayo'ing I've never written a review for Macayo Numero Uno.  \n\nI like Macayo's.  Like an errant Military Macaw seeking the colpa of Cambopata, I peregrinate across the valley, West and globe, always returning for chips and salsa I hunger for, the dishes I love to eat, and in times of fat billfold and lack of will, the Chicken Poblano.  \n\nYes, we fly off to other eateries, Sonoran and otherwise, but always returns to this traditional spot where the family has dined and occasionally drunk for more than five decades.  \n\nI think there's a half Macayo burrito in the fridge now, waiting for a microwave and a lunch....\n\nSo fly my friends, fly.  The food is time-tested, the service good, the Macayo's experience repeated across our valley and on to Las Vegas.  There are vegetarian entrees, old standards, and occasional new seasonal menu items.  And remember, the climate is warming and every degree over 100 means you get a percent off.  Macayo's #1 on Central is the hottest one around."
1,"I went to the original one on Ste Catherines for the 2-3 am scoffs and even Keeble was amazed as to how I can pack it in. I went there with Mark Vanderbol a couple of times and he just ate for 1 hour straight ,so it was safe to say I helped  introduce,many of my old friends, girlfriends, football buddies to commercialized good greek fare,. the guys on the line loved it when we came in cause we tipped and it was just that way cause they would pile on the mild sauce and pile on the yero meat and that was a heluva job. I went there with Poly 1 time in 88 to celebrate his being picked number 3 in the CFL draft ,after a big nite at THURSDAYS and Crescent st. We ate for 6 people ,true story. I look forward to 1 day going back and having my favourite submarine,ciaociao  Mou"
1,"I wanted to visit Monster Mash again before writing a review, not because I had a bad experience the first time, but because I wanted to try what they're known for- their mash. And my friends, it is indeed Monstrous.\n\nChosen as \""their pick\"" in my Lonely Planet Europe on a Shoestring guide book, Monster Mash is a no-nonsense diner with basic decor and simple but hearty food.  I have been here 4 times since arriving in Edinburgh and I plan on many more visits in the coming months. \""Happy days are here again\"" is advertised on their front window with a black and white photo of a 1950s couple about to indulge in bangers and mash. And boy do they offer bangers and mash! You can pick from three types of mashed potatoes, gravy and sausage from the menu, but they also offer daily specials which always include vegetarian options. The first time I visited I had the chicken and ham pie with chips. The saucy chicken and ham was hidden beneath a hot air balloon of puffy pastry and was just what I needed on my first day in Edinburgh. A few days later I went back to try the bangers and mash. I decided to try one of the daily specials and had the beef, tomato & basil sausage, accompanied by their classic Monster mash but with green spring onions and a nob of butter topped off with the onion gravy - caramelised onions mixed with a beef and red wine stock. It came to me as a pillow of potatoes (the best I've ever had after homemade) with my sausage (you can choose 1 or 2) resting on top, with my own boat of gravy on the side. Oh how I could not wait to dive into this!! It's easy to resist dessert on a full stomach (and believe me, it's going to happen) but MM has so many amazing desserts to choose from you've just GOT to try one of them! I've tried the Apple Crumble, which was terrific with the warm custard, but the sticky toffee pudding was the winner at the table. My mum liked it so much she was tempted to ask for the recipe! I've also shared the chocolate fudge brownie sundae, which came with a ton of whipped cream on top (my favourite part) and what I can only describe as crunchy brownie pieces- like a soft cookie, buried underneath the whip and perfect vanilla ice cream.\n\nIt's fun to mix and match (weird terminology) the sausages, mash and gravy but the menu offers so many delicious options that it's sometimes hard to choose! I'm determined to try every item on the menu by the time I leave, and guess what? I've already had the haggis, neeps and tatties checked off! And it was amazing!"
1,"To date, this is the best buffet i have ever been to. All around perfection. I have eaten here at least 5 times and will definitely go back.\n\nYes, the line will be long if your not staying with the Bellagio. It sucks but 100% worth the wait. Another slight drawback is the cost. About $35 for dinner, but this is cheap as hell for a 5 star dinner.\n\nStaff is very friendly but not too intrusive. Tables are cleaned quick and they are always around if u need something.\n\nNow the food! King crab legs, all you can eat. A pound of these things is $15 At the market, easy. A sushi station with pre-made sushi or you can get some specialty hand rolls. Perfect prime beef. And a desert bar that will make you cry it is so vast.\n\nLast time i went here i was sick and miserable (with a cold) and i still enjoyed myself. \n\nUnless your budget is very tight go here! The variety is so vast you can eat here almost every night, i did."
0,I had my sons 3rd birthday party here and the kids enjoyed themselves but the woman owner made it very uncomfortable for everyone. I felt like we were being watched like hawks. And when the balls would come out of the play area she would pick it up to throw it back where it belonged and told the kids they needed to keep the balls in the play area. Its a playground for christ sake. I spoke with the other parents and they too felt very uncomfortable because of this woman owner and workers actions. They charged us $240 for 15 kids which is actually suppose to b for 20 kids but it's a flat rate so we could not get reimbursed for the 5 kids that we didn't have RSVP for. I will never ever go back to this place again. Id rather go to the park where my kids can play freely and I can feel very comfortable.
0,This place is just a mess. My friend booked this place.  What a mistake.
0,"If I could give zero stars I could .Signed up when they first opened and was told with 30 day notice I could cancel my contract , only joined because my then trainer was there . Wrong !! When I signed up they \"" locked \"" me at a 2 year rate but could cancel at any time . Well 2 years is up and guess what still being charged and now apparently there is no recollection of the past conversations . This place is way too far for me to travel to and the hours aren't that convenient especially on the weekend . If they honored their word I probably would not be so irritated ."
0,"Heard of Food Safety?  Anyone?  I don't think the staff from this Baja Fresh have...\n\nThe staff making the burrito for the lady ahead of me accidentally dropped some ingredients on the floor.  One of the staff quickly grabbed a broom, and everyone came out to help remove the rubber mats off the floor while she sweeps.  Ok, so far, yes?  Well, it's about to get gross.\n\nAfter sweeping and the rubber floor mats put back into place, I did not see any of the staff wash their hands or replaced the gloves that was used to handle the food earlier and the rubber floor mats.  Ok, here's the kicker...\n\nThe staff who was cooking the beef inside said to the other staff, not to worry about it.  She'd only do it if someone saw it.  Do what?  Like, wash your hands and replace them white gloves that's used to handle the food that you serve to people?  Oh, ok then...  check please!\n\nThat's just McNasty!"
1,"We spent a few hours here while visiting the city. We especially enjoyed the Sports Museum and the Heinz exhibit that just opened. We also spent some time in the gift shop, which has unique items and fun gifts. We also appreciated the architecture of the building and how the museum was laid out. Easy to find what you were looking for. I would recommend it to others visiting Pittsburgh."
0,"The food was just OK. The miso super super spicy, like noserunning spicy. \n\nService wasn't great. The table slightly smelled like a dirty cleaning cloth.\n\nAnd the WORST of all they had a DJ with super loud music. AYFKM? Who wants a DJ in a sushi bar/restaurant? It was just annoying."
0,This place deleted my last review. But you should all be warned before coming here so I'm rewriting a summary.\n\nWorst doctor I've ever been to. The technicians put their hands on you without your permission and it take the doctor 30 minutes to just sign a piece of paper cause everyone that works for him is an idiot. I was literally there for 3 hours. Thank God my insurance has other places that I can go to cause I refuse to torture myself with this crap place ever again.
1,"***!!!!!***WARNING TO ALL WHO WON'T/CAN'T EAT BLOOD***!!!***!!!**\nThis is a great restaurant, my friends and I were all very happy with everything EXCEPT one thing. HANGOVER SOUP!!! It tastes great, however it contains large chunks of jellied Ox Blood. I ordered it not knowing what was in it. It highly offensive to me to eat blood as I see that it violates bible commands at Deuteronomy 12:23 and Acts 15:20,29. Other than that I loved the KimChee, the radishes are amazing. Literally the best Kimchee I've ever had. The restaurant has a very authentic feel and the workers are all Korean and there is even Korean TV playing in the dining room. I only can wish that they would have had a warning about the Blood as I had no idea when I ordered. (didn't find out until I had eaten half of it!)...I did of course inform the waitress about the need to have it disclosed on the menu and she seemed very accommodating."
0,"For a NY Steak that cost $43 it had a surprising amount of gristle and fat on it, far too much for a steak of that price.   In fact I had to cut away half of what I was served just to get to the actual meat.   I was really unimpressed, a good cut of steak at an expensive restaurant should not be mostly gristle and fat!   Additionally I was less than impressed that the steaks did not include any sort of side whatsoever, and you have to pay extra for a side of potatoes.  The service was pretty good however, which is what is keeping me from giving this a rating of one."
1,"I personally love this bakery but it is too far away!!  From bakery to bakery you will find that the sugar content changes even when comparing what you think are \""like\"" products. For instance, a cream puff, if you are at a french bakery the cream puff may look the same but they generally go lighter on the sugar ingredient so you may even be able to detect a slight egg taste in the pastry, Jewish bakeries and Mexican bakeries also tend to go lighter on the sugar so although it is a tasy treat I often walk away thinking it was good but I have had better. Great Buns bakes the way I like it. The Cream Puffs a light and fluffy and sweet like I believe a dessert should be. Not sugary, mind you, just sweet and delicious. Obviously there are bakeries that have slightly changed their recipes to meet the American sweet tooth market and this is one of those bakeries.\n\nAs an extra bonus, if you call them and tell them you are looking for a certain treat such as a Napolean, if they don't have them available that day they will try to accomodate your request by making them the following day or day after.  They have always been wonderful about trying to fill your sweet tooth cravings for you.  BTW Napoleans are very hard to find around town and theirs are to die for!!  Call ahead and make sure you arrive on a day they have Napoleans available. You will not be disappointed... :)"
0,"This place seems pretty popular but I'm not feeling it.  If you really have a craving  for local food then maybe you might go here, but really the food is kind of lousy.  Big portions, but no good flavor.  My katsu was kind of soggy, mac salad is weak and tasted of garlic powder, manapua is like the kind you get in the frozen food section at 99 Ranch, kalbi is average, grilled salmon is ok but the Teri sauce is cloying sweet.  I can cook most items bettah myself.  Depends how hungry you are, but the girl at the counter was cool.  And they have no hot mustard for the saimin and wonton min.  There's a big flat screen tv in there though."
0,"During my last trip in Vegas, we stopped at the Extra Lounge for some drinks since it was smack dab in the middle of the Planet Hollywood Casino.\n\nBasically, the service here isn't that great, and the drinks were not good at all.. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying Vegas prices for drinks, but not for shitty drinks... My friends and I ordered LC's, and usually we like them, but the ones here almost killed us. \n\nThe only good thing about this place is that it's in the middle of the casino, so you can stop here for a drink real quick if walking around."
1,"We are beyond impressed with this business. The facility is spotless around the clock and offers incredible amenities for our two English bulldogs. Their indoor and outdoor play areas are spacious and they have an incredible staff of dog lovers. Highly recommend this for puppy daycare, boarding, and grooming. Our bullies came out looking like they were ready for a magazine cover after being groomed here."
0,"This place is a freaking joke!\n\nMy dog had an abscess tooth root and his face was swollen up. \n\nI brought him in and he was misdiagnosed with a bug bite and given some antibiotics to get rid of the swelling: $200. \n\nA year later it came back big time and was infected! They lanced it and gave me medicine until he could get an extraction:  $200\n\nBrought him in for the extraction which cost $600 and they pulled a tooth on the wrong side of his mouth!! \n\nWhen I contacted them they wanted me to pay to have them remove the correct tooth!! Finally after not backing down they decided to do my the \""courtesy\"" of extracting the correct tooth free of charge but refused to refund any of the now $1000 I had paid previously for his treatment even though they knew that I had to open a care credit card to pay for the surgery!!\n\nMy dog now has two large gaps on either side of his mouth and has trouble eating...\n\nNever! Ever! Ever! Let them near your dog!!"
1,This place is pretty cool and it's a nice change from the regular bars you find in Vegas. This bar has no TVs and no gambling. Wow! That was really nice. The staff was great and there was a great jazz band playing. They only thing that wasn't good was one of our appetizer dishes was ice cold in the middle. All of their food is appetizers/tapas and most of it is bite size and deep fried. So one of the dishes was obviously frozen and then not fried for the correct amount of time. Oh well. No biggy.
0,"Never thought I'd downgrade my rating to such a low point for this restaurant. But, among other difficulties, their soup tasted like what I made as a college freshman my first time making something from hot water vegetables and a chicken leg - and then added a grotesque volume of pepper because it didn't taste like anything - that is what I overpaid for here. Fried okra tasted like something I used to get from a grocery store frozen foods bin and microwave until it was crispy, the ranch dressing tasted like some bottled slop I used to get in the '80s, the burger bun was white gluten glop and the burger boring.\n\nWe got a card with our check asking for our contact info so we can get bombarded with 'social media'.Instead of giving up all our contact info, we simply wrote \""see our yelp reveiw\"". \n\nWhat saved this from a 1-star was the wait staff - friendly attentive and on-time."
1,"Here we are again... 2/3/13  My last review was 9 months ago! It was nice to see that there were a couple other diners that evening. I started off with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup followed by what I call an endless soup. The menu calls it Vietnamese rice noodle soup with beef. It comes in an oversize bowl & I'm lucky if I can make the level drop 2\"" before I'm full. I like the soup because its loaded with tender beef. The broth is excellent too. Its a combination of very subtle flavors much like a fine wine.\nMy wife had Crispy Tofu & Beef with Broccoli. All in all it was a very pleasant evening."
1,"The food here is just like every other Bojangles... Straight up delicious... But the thing is I love the staff here... \n\nThe sanitation score is consistently high... The coffee is always hot and delicious, which is tops in my book... Sometimes I just need a jolt to get me to the office! I head out to work well before 6 am and I have never encountered a rude or unhappy person on the microphone or at the window... My order is always correct, everything is always hot and yummy and I leave with a smile on my face... \n\nThese guys work hard to put out quality food before a lot of people even roll out of bed...  They clearly put the morning people on the drive thru in the early morning and for that?  Extra star for you, Bojangles... See you soon!"
0,"Food was good, no doubt. We visited twice and tried a wide variety of items. All of them tasty and well prepared.  But the prices are ridiculously high for what you get. The indoor seating area was pretty bad. Fairly messy and dirty. And the constant fight against the swarms of flies made eating here a chore rather than a pleasure. Outside seating looks better, but when it's 110 degrees out, inside is the only option. The cafeteria style ordering system was very slow and seems very inefficient.  It's  unlikely we will visit again even though the food was quite tasty."
1,"I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\n\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."
0,"Let me preface with by saying, Emily Stooks (Horning) is an incredible teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed her class and positive energy. She deserves 5 stars.\nI had high hopes for Urban Yoga, which was close to the friend's house I was staying with for the holiday. I went for the new student special since I was in town for 10 days. I made it to 5 classes. Overall the instructors were pretty warm and welcoming. The reason for the 1 out of 5 stars is because of the awful business practices that do not align with the philosophy they teach.\nWhen I purchased the new student special, I told the sales associate I was visiting from Portland and was not able to bring my mat. Most studios I've encountered during my many years of a regular practice do not charge for mat use but Urban Yoga does. I requested an exception be made since I was traveling (and they were very cheap, low-end mats that were being rented at $2/class). The sales associate told me flat out no. I asked her to talk to a manager or someone to see if she could get permission. She suggested I go purchase a cheap mat locally. I was taken back and asked her opinion about what I should do with this mat when I leave again. Her response was to give it away or throw it away. After my initial shock, I asked one last time if she could ask if a manager would make an exception which she agreed to look into. After class I again was told no. At that point I wished I hadn't purchased the new student package. I ended up finding a friend of a friend that let me borrow a mat for the week. What a terrible experience.\nWith one exception, during every class the studio was very chilly making it difficult to initially warm up the body properly.\nAdditionally every single class I went to at that studio let out no sooner than 5 minutes late and sometimes up to 15 minutes late. Although I was on vacation, this is incredibly inconsiderate of people's time and schedules.\nI find it quite curious that Urban Yoga pretty consistently gets poor reviews from out-of-towners visiting Phoenix. I will not be returning to this studio over my Christmas break in Phoenix."
1,"I always love a place where the employees look like they're having a good time, and Ike's had it! Rachel was the best - not only really enthusiastic and attentive, but also a lot of fun.\n\nWe got the Bear Hug and the Spiffy Tiffy . Both were fantastic and the dutch crumble bread tasted like a buttery biscuit. All the ingredients tasted fresh and high-quality, especially the pesto. Large portions, though, so we got a dinner out of it, too.\n\nA little pricey, but definitely worth it, especially because we happened to get there during happy hour (4pm-7pm, I think) so we got a free drink and chips. They also give a caramel apple pop with the sandwich.\n\nCan't wait for the new location opening soon on Mill Ave!"
0,Very slow service and they never wash ALL the windows inside and out. I have to ask them to clean my inside windshield every time.
1,We were staying at the MGM but decided to take a drive and try this place. We had no regrets. We and the kids loved the food.
0,This tea/coffee house looks quite quaint from the outside and it looked full of promise. Inside is nice enough but i wasn't impressed. The two cakes me and my son had were warmed up i think to mask the dryness of them i had a coffee cake slice and my son had a chocolate muffin these cakes don't need heated up we had soft drinks and my friend had a coffee. Don't think i'll be trying again and oh the staff seemed kind of awkward not really that friendly although the owner himself seemed very nice!
0,"The atmosphere and attitude of the employees was poor overall. It seemed that no one wanted to be there, and were very put out to make 2 sandwiches. I wasn't impressed. It was like everyone had just been reprimanded by a manager or something...."
1,"Went to the Heap It Festival in Scotsdale Az today. We had the noodle salad w/chicken and split some dumplings. The food was awesome and the young man that took our order was fast, happy and friendly. We would search out this food truck and eat there again!"
1,Simplemente  DELICIOSO =0
0,"The best thing I had here was the oreo cookie and cream dessert. Everything else was moderate. I made a call here to ask about the hours and the least they could have done was tell me there is a tshirt sleeve policy but I wasn't notified. So when I got there I had to buy a tshirt just to get into an overly pretentious buffet. Customer service needs improvement by giving the overworked staff a raise, improve management, and recognize those who work hard and provide praises/rewards consistently."
1,"I am here from CA for the weekend & found this studio on yelp... I took a class from Nikki and really enjoyed her style, knowledge, and passion! I will definitely be back next time I come to Tempe! Very welcoming!"
1,we have gone many times for Saturday / Sunday brunch. food is great. My complaint is at times it seems like a day care in there. a lot of screaming kids.
1,Stayed again 10/17/2014\nExcellent check in by Bruce and our queen room was clean! I love this place! \nParking was a little rough later in the evening  and several work trucks made navigating the parking area difficult.  I would suggest to the management to have the larger vehicles park on the street. Checking out was quick and easy!
0,"needed to get something to eat for breakfast while i was waiting for my plane.  i had chicken sandwich with aioli.  it was alright, not bad and not xlnt, but alright.  i mean its express and at least it wasnt prepackaged and served cold or zapped in a microwave, so its definitely a step above that.  it was more or less prepared by a cook."
1,"The BEST fish n chips, outside of London. Surprisingly, damn good chicken for the land lovers as well. Clean, friendly and always good. My only beef with the place (ha!) is that they wont accept the tilapia meal coupons for the chicken combo."
1,"The giant smokers outside are a true sign of things to come. I ordered 4 ribs, greens, and Mac n cheese. My plate was so heavy I thought the to go bag would break. I just finished my 3rd meal from this one plate all for $10.50.  Very smokey ribs, tons of meat on em too. Hot and mild BBQ sauces, hot was very flavorful but too hot for me. I took a small dab of it with the mild at the recommendation of the nice lady serving.  I had the best greens of my life and excellent Mac and cheese.  My fianc\u00e9 got ribs and wings with amazing BBQ beans and candied yams. This kind of food is hard to find and good for the soul."
1,"Very Professional ,Knowledgeable and Honest work!  Bathroom lights went out in both upstairs bathrooms.  I checked the main breaker all seemed in order.  Although not a critical failure, Brad responded the same day I called. he quickly diagnosed the problem and the lights were back on!  \n\nBrad provided a free estimate and reasonable rates, and took the time to explain the problem."
0,"BAD! ....But that's what we get for straying away from our favorite sushi spot (Kaizen on Paradise Rd.) \n\nWe walked into Sushi Fever about 40 minutes before they were due to close...AND they made us VERY aware of that. While walking in, being sat, giving our food and drink orders, we were told \""We are closing soon\"" at least 5 times.\n\nI don't even remember what we ordered, for good reason. Everything tasted old and fishy. \n\nWe made it clear to them that we werent going to be long... so I guess that gave them the OK to start breaking down their sushi bar and mopping with straight bleach. \n\nI didn't know which was worse--The fishy taste or the bleach filled air! \n\nWell... We won't be back. That is all."
1,"This was my third visit here which I initially found by accident. Each time, whether I did mild or spicy the food has been great.  Tonight I had a great lamb stew that you ate with their special bread.  The owner and his wife are very pleasant and are happy to engage a visiting tourist.  Great food and an unbeatable price, just off the strip."
0,"waited over an hour for my sushi at lunch.  my husbnad received his food after 30 minutes which seemed like a long time for a mostly empty restaurant.  Being the gentlemen he is, he waited for me to get my food before eating his.  By the time mine arrived his was cold.  We had to get back to work and after waiting an hour for all our food to be served, we didnt even get to eat it there.  Asked for to go boxes as soon as my sushi arrived and Was nearly late getting back to work.  Server was nice enough but infrequent drink refills and no apology for the severly long delay.  Will not be returning."
0,"We came here after a long day of shopping and freezing!!!  All 4 of us felt like soup and apps.  We were greeted right away and seated right away.  Cool!  The server came to welcome us and took our drink orders.  She seemed to be in a rush and a little short with us, okay!  She came back with our drinks and took our food order.  She seemed irritated that we were only ordering soups and an app.  \n\nChicken Enchilada Soup - It was good, but again a tad salty for me.  \nTriple Dipper:  Wings Over Buffalo - Good and spicy\n                           Fried Cheese - Good and gooey\n                           Original Chicken Crispers - Good and cripsy\n\nThe server's attitude bring down the mood."
1,"Please note this is a review of the shopping/casino/attractions NOT the hotel.\n\nThe Venetian did it right. It's one of the few luxurious places on the Strip that is more classy than cheesy. Attention was given to every detail and it shows.\n\nThe shops were lovely. It looks like an italian streetscape complete with canals and painted sky. One of the top three malls in Vegas. Mostly very high-end, with a few more reasonably priced places (hooray Ann Taylor!). We went into a little cafe in the middle of the afternoon for some gelato and pastries. A much better choice for ambiance and respite than the new gelato place in the Palazzo.\n\nBe sure to walk around and see the other parts of the complex. The ceilings and floors are amazing.\n\nHusband and I went to the Guggenheim Hermatige here, but were disappointed with the $15 entry fee when we realized it was only one room/gallery. So skip it.\n\nOverall a great place to spend an afternoon even if you're not gambling."
1,"If you're looking for a classic, no frills, sushi bar experience, this is the place for you.  Sit at the sushi bar and chum it up with your chef.  Great food, great prices!  If Kyoto is closed, go here!  It's just a couple blocks south!  You won't regret it.  Don't let the negative reviews fool you... Some people go to a restaurant to be seen socially.  Some want to eat good food! If you are the former, go to roka akor.  If you're the latter, give stingray sushi a go!"
1,"Meat & Potatoes was a blast. Arrived w/o a reservation on a Saturday night and even though we were told we would not get a table for another 1.5-2 hours we could find seats at the bar. We found one for the two of us (of course) but decided to stake our territory anyway with the one chair and to grab another when one freed up, which took some waiting and work including dealing with a rude old man...\n\nAside from that I love the dark interior of M & P with the mirrors and gold trim surrounding the room. It adds a nice element of elegant coziness. \n\nThe bartenders greeted us and were kind enough to give us a sample of the beers we were interested in trying. Ordered the Oscar and my bf ordered the Kobe Flat Iron. Oscar had a cut of veal, a fried soft shell crab on top and a side of risotto. Delicious - kind of on the salty side but I like it that way. I ate every bite but I had a hard time cutting with the knives they gave me (first butter knife then was given a steak knife when realized I was cutting with a butter knife). And the service continued to be great - the bartenders checked in periodically, were friendly and didn't push you out of  M & P. They let you soak in the experience and we did."
0,First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35
0,"Went here last night. Food wasn't great, really what you would expect from a place like this. There was a clothing plastic tag in my salad. They comped my meal. The waiter was a good guy. Great bread, I'll give them that."
1,"Was a big fan of the lincoln park location in chicago, so to find the same menu, at similar prices with al fresco dining overlooking the bellagio fountains was a nice treat.\n\nThe service was super fast, and the warm brie was superb."
0,I had been here once before and the food was pretty good and I love all the beers but the music was WAY too loud - couldn't hear my friends talk. I went there last night before a comedy show and there were many empty tables but after an hour of waiting I got just 1 beer and had to run down to 5 guys and scarf down a burger. So food and beers are good but service isn't.
0,"I cannot believe we walked from the PALAZZO all the way to PLANET HOLLYWOOD (about a half hour walk in the heat) just for PINK'S.  It's just another overrated spot!  It lacks the history that the one in LA provides AND it's more expensive!  Instead of a run down, hole in the wall place, this Pink's is like a blinged out version..I guess that's where our extra dollar goes to...\n\nBottom line is..two hot dogs and a drink came up to $26.  It wasn't even good, I took one bite and made my boyfriend finish the rest.  I'd much rather stop by Earl's inside Planet Hollywood for some amazing sandwiches for only $6!  I'll probably never get caught at this establishment again."
1,"I head to the public market every Saturday to get my veggies and sometimes on other days to eat at the food trucks. The market on Saturday is impressive. You can get delicious bread, locally grown veggies, fruit, plants, and many other locally made wares. Most stalls take credit card and if they don't, you can buy with a card at customer service. The Wed market is less impressive... not much there, but definitely good if you forgot something or need a couple items mid week. This isn't the most amazing farmer's market in the world, but it is my favorite in Phoenix."
0,Meh.. maybe I needed to be drunk to enjoy THIS  pizza.
1,"I would give it a 5 for food alone....the jalapeno cilantro hummus with chicken is my favorite food in the ENTIRE world.  It really is that amazing.  I also love the black bean burger, the chicken schwarma, the meditterean chicken salad, and pesto lavosh turkey wrap, the tomato basil bisque...all amazing.\n\nWatch out for the moroccan gatzpatcho- disgusting....cold salsa basically with chunks...  Ewww and the grilled veggie wrap makes you smell like garlic for a week which is weird since it doesn't really have a good flavor.\n\nAND MY BIGGEST BEEF WITH PJ-   They bring my hummus and immediately bring my food 1 minute later.  Time appetizers and entrees appropriately please."
0,"This restaurant was clean, and nice, the service was good. However, stay away from the bun bo hue, it was a disaster. I've never tasted anything so horrible!!! The pho was decent though, I've never tried anything else there. I will probably not come back."
0,Wish I could go lower then one star drinks are good but slow unless the bar tender likes you cuz he thinks you're tip is good.kitchen is dirty a.f. I would never eat there with a satisfactory rating from the health dept. Trashes allways overflowed rite by the kitchen chef table management only Cares about returning customers food times are 55+ minutes if there's more then 4 tables servers out front smoking with no view or hand washing sinks u never know.... I'll never come by for food only drinks if I'm desperate for drunk Humen interactions. If u order something that has a few changes from basic menu items be prepared to wait......and wait....
1,"I was in Montreal for a quick get away and was craving some Korean food.  Living in New York, I yelped for a Korean place to eat in Montreal i originally missed this place when I came here a month ago due to maintenance they opened after 2pm didnt know assumed the place was shut down.\n\nI ordered the bulgogi and the kalbi and the bi bim bap was real good there better then I had in a long time. They give you a decent amount of food but coming from America the standard here is much more then the standard served in other countries so I knew I would have to eat twice the normal amount to satisfy my hunger.\n\nThe restaurant has really nice decor and the chalkboard adds a nice touch to it. The kitchen is literally right in front of you so you see them cook the food and the staff is very attentive and kept asking us the food was up to our standard. All in all it was great food and a good atmosphere will repeat."
0,"My fourth time in Vegas we stayed at the Luxor. \n\nProbably wasn't such a good thing that the third time we were at the Venetian because the standard had been set pretty high.  Really though we weren't looking for a total Vegas experience.  My boyfriend was there for work and we kind of just planned to chill. \n\nIn the 110 degree sun we spent time at the pool and I was busy looking for shade because there is no way you can drink vodka and grapefruit juice slathered in oil baking under a sub-Saharan sun.  The pool was very packed and I was a little surprised because there are such nice pools nearby, like Mandalay Bay.  But it was convenient and apparently a popular weekend to be in Vegas.  \n\nAs I lay in the shade scanning the complementary Vegas magazine I can't help but look at everybody, I'm looking at their bodies and their state of intoxication.  I'm wondering how much time they spend at the gym, what Midwest state they are from and if the couple making out on the side of the pool are on ecstacy. I am wearing dark sunglasses so for all these people know I could be asleep and am not staring at their breasts. I look back at my magazine when the ladies who are sitting directly across from me return with their aluminum bottles of Bud Light.  One of them has a fresh looking tattoo and I squint to try to make out the words and as I stare and squint I see that it says in curly lettering \""Brad's Bitch.\""  Did she have a crazy drunken night or what?  I then thought that there is no way someone would really tattoo that on themselves but then I thought, maybe someone actually would. Some guys came by their chairs and one of them posed for a picture next to her freshly tattooed arm.  Could that have been Brad?  I mean I hope that was Brad and I hope that was his real name.\n\nThis was one of three stories I left the Luxor with so I'm giving it only two stars because there are many other options in Las Vegas.  I truthfully can't say it was a bad experience overall but the atmosphere felt like Reno,"
0,This is ridiculous! 20+ minutes waiting for a to go salad..... A SALAD!!!!!  There was only two orders ahead of me and I saw people behind me getting served first!
1,"This is how you do business right.\nNice place, great food and drink, knowledgable and energetic staff, and consistency.\nKeep it up guys this is why you are always full."
1,"I had no idea! This was amazing cannot wait to get back and eat something else freshly made by someone who has my kind of philosophy on food  YES! It is well worth the wait for the \""lunch of the week\"" (as i only get to eat out once per week) This time i had the eggless salad sandwhich with facon bacon, l&t, and siracha. Yuuuuuummmmmae!!!!"
1,"My wife wanted us to try this new place out.  And, I am glad that we did.\n\nThe restaurant is located kinda on the outskirts of Chinatown.  It is located within the Koreatown mall complex.  Unfortunately, there is not alot of activity within this mall.  We did not think it was a very good location to have a restaurant... kinda out of the way and kinda hidden.\nIf you are facing the mall, it is on the right corner slot.\n\nAs you walk in, it is a pretty nice place.  However, there were not alot of patrons when we were there (granted it just opened).  \n\nThe menu selection is huge.  We ordered a glass of water, thai tea, banh kho, bun bo hue, and pho dac biet.\n\nOkay, the water tasted like bleach.  Yeah, it did not go over well.  Great thing is that I mentioned it to the manager and she gave me a free bottle of water instead.  That was very sweet of her.\n\nThe Thai Ice Tea was good.  Little bit too rich; however, I just poured more water to make it less powerful.\n\nMy favorite dish was the banh kho.  It is like patties topped with some fried onions, shrimp, and other spices.  You wrap this patty in lettuce, mince, herbs, etc.. and dip it into some fish sauce.  It was great.  Only issue was that they did not give us enough lettuce.  Wish they did.\n\nThe bun bo hue was okay.  It was not too spicy.  Such a shame!!  wish it was.  Also, I was disappointed that they did not have the pork feet.  Hey man, what can I say????\n\nMy wife tried the Pho Dac Biet.  She said it was good.  The broth was very tasty and better than most places.\n\nAs for service, they were really good.  Since we were the only ones in the restaurant, we had great service!\n\nAs for price, it was a bit more expensive than most vietnamese restaurants.  I guess they have to charge more because of the distance and less clients.  \n\nOverall, my wife and I really like this restaurant.  Service was excellent, food was not that bad ~ actually above average and good, and price was okay.  Personally, I think this is one of the better vietnamese restaurants in china town.\n\nWe would be back!\n\nThanks and enjoy"
1,"I've only had Gelato once. \nThat was last month.\nI had it here, at Gelato Spot - cozied up next to a fave sushi joint. \n\nI was selfish. I had like 6 samples before I could decide. There was alot of pressure to please myself this day, on the day I had my first-ever Gelato experience. A friend recommended the chocolate and peanut butter mixed in a shake. Instead, I went simple: one scoop of pistachio. It was remarkable - the perfect blend of sweet with nutty goodness. My friend savored the tiramisui, also an excellent choice if your Sweet Tolerance is higher than average. \n\nI'd definitely go back to this place, although I believe my selection of treats is smaller than the average person since I can't really stand a full-throttle sugar rush that many of the flavors proffer. \n\nBut, hey, I'm good with the pistachio, thanks."
0,"Meh...This is the second time I've had ethiopian food, so I'm no expert, but I can tell when food is flavorful or not. Severely lacking in depth of flavor. It was cooked potatoes/lentils/etc on injera. A little bit of curry flavoring? Service wasn't great as we waited for 1 person to run the restaurant....Wouldn't return."
0,"Do not leave anything in your car that you value. I have been coming here once a week for over a year getting the \""gold\"" wash, which is about $22. The last time I went, I had a few gift cards in my door and when I got back in, they were gone. I asked about them, and all I was told was \""they have signs telling you not to leave valuables in your car\"".  The GM, Del, told me he will give me a basic car wash for my troubles, but he can't verify if they were in there or not. So after spending $100 per month there, $150 if you include my other car, they are going to take my $50 in gift cards and give me a $15 wash. Thanks for going out of your way champ! Go to Charleston West Car Wash if you want the best wash in town. I dealt with them for years and they were always great, but when I moved to Green Valley, I started going to this place. Not any longer. I will drive out of my way to go to Charleston from now on. Oh yea, they still hand wash your car unlike Green Valley \""formerly hand\"" Car Wash!"
1,"Finally. A Barriques that barreaks the mold of Barriques in Madison. (You get all that?)\n\nIt's clean. (Yay)\nThere's usually parking right outside. (Yay)\nPlenty of space to work solo, or larger tables if you're there for chit chat. (Yay)\nLet's talk about how it's clean again. (Double yay)\nThey offer 50% off an espresso drink when you check in on Yelp (cha-ching)\nBright sunny atmosphere is awesome if you're working and need some vis stim. (Yay)\nIt's clean, there's that. (See where I'm headed?)\n\nSo far out of the ones that I have been to, this Barrriques tops them all. If you're feeling like a tea-se grab their iced Rooibos. Tasty in the mouth, antioxidant charged for your bod."
0,"Like Kristen H. I am giving stars for the beautiful architecture because the food was not worth it (every single food item was ice cold) and the bill was ridiculous.  We had been here about 5 years ago for a Sunday brunch and thought it was better than \""Vegas type\"" brunches.  We were looking forward to an enjoyable Father's Day brunch, which by the way, when I called was told it was $24.95.  WRONG!  It was $29.99 (because it was Father's Day) and coffee was $2.95 each.  This is insane!  We have been eating brunch at Phipps Conservatory when the flower shows are in progress (only time they have brunch).  For either $24.95 or $22.95 (can't remember) everything except alcoholic beverages are includes and so is the tip.  By the way, so is the admission to the flower exhibits and you can walk through at a leisurely pace and spend as much time as you like!  The food is so much fresher at Phipps and the offerings a little more unique.  I will NEVER come back to The Grand Concourse for brunch.  it was overcrowded; we had reservations and still had to wait 35 minutes.  People were shoving in the lines and it wasn't a pleasant experience.  At Phipps, they only have so many seatings and they open the doors at exactly that time. They don't overcrowd the room.   No one else wanders in later unless of course they have a reservation for that particular seating and they're late.  \n\nAs I said, NEVER AGAIN."
0,"Ambience was amazing. We were seated quickly on a Saturday night. Food however very disappointing. The \""Belgium\"" fries were soggy and pizza was cold and doughy.  We spoke to manager and he didn't seem to care.  Come for the beer and atmosphere but not the food."
1,This is a really great place to buy all your liquior needs! Its cheap and most definitely a spot if your friends are out in vegas and need to pre game before heading out of the hotel. Theres a bunch located in vegas!
1,"Super hidden. Really small, dive type California style spot. Skinny: healthy choices, Fats: non-healthy choices. Not a ton of menu items, somewhat pricey for the portions. Overall, a good place for a quick bite. Just hope you can snatch a seat."
1,"it took me awhile to actually find this place.  but it was well worth the wasted gas.\n\nthe burritos, tacos, beans, rice are all good.  the food is top notch.\n\nif you go during lunch on a work week be prepared to wait in line to order and fight for an available table.  the food is worth the fight."
0,"This place is nasty and the owner and manager \""Mo\"" are jerk offs!!!!! i placed order for pizza and chicken wings and both were gross but chicken wings were a lot worse so i called to make complaint. The guy on phone told me what is he supposed to do about it and then when i asked to speak to owner he hung up on me. i called back to speak to owner and when i told him his food was not good he told me f*#@ you and hung up. I would never recommend this place and they have bad business owners."
1,"Delightful interior with Mardi Gras/Bourbon Street murals and a giant jester statue inside.  Bar area merges into the restaurant area.  Upstairs seating overlooks downstairs like a outdoor balcony looking down on a street cafe.  Mojitos, chicken and sausage Jambalaya, and sweet potato fries are good, as are the po'boys.  The food is not that spicy; more on the bland side when one thinks of Cajun."
0,Hour and a half delivery time was my option.  Offered $100 tip for something faster.   They thought I was joking.  I literally had a hundred ready to go but they wouldn't do it and thought I was joking.  They even hung up on me. I get that since it seems over the top but I was serious.  Sad face :(
1,"Randomly saw a sign on the street while driving by that advertised a discount on pedicures so my husband and I decided to stop. There were 2 guys available so they sat us right away. The shop was pretty small (only 4 manicure stations and 4 spa pedicure chairs), was located in a slow, unattractive strip mall and there were only 2 other people getting services done. So why 4 stars? Because the nail techs were SUPER friendly and accommodating. Most nail places rush through service to push you in and out as quick as possible. The guy I had took extra time to make sure my cuticles, nails, polish etc. were perfect. They also use hot lotion, hot stones and hot towels for massage. Awesome!!!"
0,"Like old sweat shorts... The Gym stinks. 45 mins for food.. Poor service,  no idea what the specials were,  gross washrooms,  dirty and more.. Even the name doesn't make sense..  Would not bother going back. Avoid if possible."
1,"I was remiss in not getting that one owner's name when we visited tonight, but he was delightful, and the chocolate was divine! I had two truffles and two ganaches and all were better than expected. The market's atmosphere was great. Highly recommend."
0,"After 6 months we almost signed on with a different Camden property because this one was so horrible. We decided not to so we could move to a house after our lease was up. (If you transfer to another Camden you start a new lease). \n\nWe were on vacation at the beginning and had someone checking on our place while we were gone. We received phone calls/email/letter on the door about- not picking up dog poop, having a closed & clean trash bin outside the door (for dog poop since they did not provide one on our side of the complex), and having a firearm. I explained the manager we were out of town on vacation and she harassed me with multiple phone calls arguing. I explained the trash bin (that was closed and clean) was outside our door for dog poop because they didn't provide one. She told me to walk to the dumpster and I told her that I would not late at night by myself. So the trash can solved the issue of the dog poop around our place not being our dogs. She then harassed me about my gun. After a \""sexual assault\"" in the complex I started wearing my gun on my hip late at night when getting off work and when taking my dogs outside late at night.  NV is an open carry state. She said that guns aren't allowed, which makes this my fault for not reading it in the lease and I accepted that. She argued with me telling me how I'm putting myself at risk by having a gun because I don't know how to use it and she would know if I have, or have not had training or classes. Spare me your personal opinion because this isn't a political debate. What an unprofessional manager. I said that we would move out to a different complex and then she said, \""It's okay. We have a bailiff that lives in the community. We just need to copy your blue card.\"" Wow sudden change. They love the money coming in that much that they can go from aggressive harassment to kindness. \n\nThey charge $200 per a pet for a non-refundable deposit that goes no where, but perhaps to their bonuses. They have two trash bins in the community for dog poop and they don't pick up the poop that everyone leaves. This is going to lead to roaches and water beetles next summer, I guarantee it. People are not going to walk across the hot black-top with their dogs in the middle of a Las Vegas summer to drop poop off at a trash bin. This burns their paws and you aren't supposed to walk them on the black top not until a few hours after the sun has set because it stays hot. They don't care though. \n\nMaintenance has their own key to enter your home when they schedule maintenance giving you a 24 hour notice, or when you put in a request to fix an appliance. I put on multiple requests to not enter my home without calling first and one of us being home. They didn't listen. One time I put on that on there and I was getting ready for work. The maintenance guy knocked on my door and when he didn't get a response immediately he put the key in the door and started turning it. Mind you I was pulling my shirt on walking down the hallway while he was opening my door. Another time they left the door unlocked to my home. For one I don't want my dogs getting out, nor do I want someone in my place without my being home so I know my things aren't getting stolen. \n\nThey don't clean up after people. Neighbors leave dog poop all over the place. They blame everyone for it, even though I've shown them the trash bin of my own many times. One time maintenance was banging on the door at 8AM to ask if this large poop outside my door was my 5 lb. dog's poop. Is that necessary? It is way to early, especially for people who work at night, and the poop doesn't even match, AND you know the trash bin next to the door you're knocking on is full of dog poop. They also don't pick up broken glass that is left throughout the rocks after people's parties (it sat there for 5 months), cigarettes, etc. \n\n3 months prior to moving out we were harassed with calls/letters/emails about renewing our lease all within 4 days. Thank you for bombarding us while we are busy."
1,Salmon Belly and Blue Fin Tuna Nigiri..... yes please!  50 pieces? Wow!
0,"Good coffee as you would expect at Starbucks, quick service, but totally turned off by the employees constant chatter amongst themselves. I really don't need to hear what friend did what, superbowl plans, what they had for dinner....."
1,"We went in January for dinner as my husband received a gift card. Yes, this place is pricey, but well worth it. The service is phenomenal. They even have bathroom attendants! \n\nMy husband got the bone-in filet and I got the king crab legs. He ordered the wedge salad and I had the chopped salad. We had the sugar snap peas and scalloped potatoes as sides. Even though he asked for the filet as medium, it came medium rare. He didn't mind. I had a bite and while it was very tender, I would have sent it back for more cooking. My king crab legs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked - not too salty or too watery. The sugar snap peas were crisp and the scalloped potatoes were very rich. \n\nOur server was spot on until we finished our meal. She was being attentive to a large table, but we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes once our entree dishes were cleared. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. \n\nI think this is a great place to go for a special occasion dinner. We're not the only ones who think that because the restaurant was packed in early January."
0,"Ewwww.  The shawarma was gross.  I really don't know what Sababa uses for spice on this dish but STOP!  And a really simple dish to make is Taboule...but somehow Sababa managed to put way too much bulgur into it.  Very disappointing.  Will NOT waste my money, my time or my taste buds on such lackluster middle eastern food again."
1,"good service, fair price.  fidel (owner of the shop) worked at courtesy imports before -- if you need performance work done on Mazda or Mitsubishi, he's the man.  look nowhere else.\n\n(got my lowering springs installed by him just today)"
0,"J'ai connu mieux, en effet. Je suis en total accort avec l'avis d'Emilie P, c'est-\u00e0-dire que cette place est devenue une institution pour branch\u00e9s.\n\nJ'y allais quand j'\u00e9tais \u00e9tudiante et qu'on avait des cours d'histoire de l'art, et m\u00eame l\u00e0, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 la limite de l'insultant. L'attitude des employ\u00e9s est extr\u00eamement bizarre et souvent d\u00e9plac\u00e9e. Je me sens jug\u00e9e chaque fois que je passe les portes... pas tr\u00e8s vendeur comme mus\u00e9e.\n\nDommage pour l'art visuel contemporain, qui n'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas beaucoup de vitrines. Cela dit, les petites galeries sont d'un grand espoir pour ce milieu effervescent et majoritairement underground.\n\nMa suggestion: allez d\u00e9couvrir les nombreuses galeries du Vieux Montr\u00e9al, mais aussi les autres, qui ont beaucoup moins de budget."
1,"Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out so naturally I have tried what I think are most all the \""breakfast\"" joints in town but for some reason or the other, I'd never stopped by the Village Inn.  Boy, I am sure glad that I did!\n\nGreat menu, great service (Thanks Gina) and good rib sticking food.  Move over Good Egg, you have some competition."
0,"Works in a pinch because they're open 24 hours, but it should be a last resort type of option. If you have exhausted all other choices, if nothing is open, if you are unable to walk across the street to get a slice of pizza, or if you are generally afraid of the dark, then and only then, should you have a meal here.\n\nI'm guilty of eating here a few times cause I can skip the line with my player's status and I'm lazy. But food is pricey for what you get and they can't cook a steak properly.  I will say the bread service is the best part, but that's not a good thing.\n\nI'm not even gonna lie, I'll probably eat here again.  Probably a few times.  But I'll live with the crap, and feel good about it. Thanks, Coach Ditka."
0,"This place was terrible! The first thing that I noticed when I sat down was the floor was wet. I figured they had just mopped, boy was I wrong! As I was sitting there during my meal a drip of water caught my eye. I looked up and the duct work was leaking! There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor! Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me. \n\nNow about the food. First it was way over priced. Each item is sold separately. I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over. A cocktail is on average $8. I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right? WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible! Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread. When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted. I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor! A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better. I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal. \n\nI will never go here again. Moral of the story... overpriced, gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room."
1,"I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on the reviews. I took my boyfriend and a couple of friends for breakfast. Amazing service, amazing food!!!! I got the truffled egg sandwich without the bread and my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were mind blowing. \n\nThis is in a not so nice area of downtown and is a fantastic little gem. I'm hoping to go back tomorrow for breakfast before we fly home. Their lunch menu looks great too!! \n\nA couple of tips: they don't split checks when they're busy and they only seat complete parties."
0,"I have been coming here for years. And this place has made me very upset. Apparently this place will cater to pimps, and hoes. And drunks waking in at 3am. But when you, a normal human being trip and fall one time this place won't want you back. Better not waste your time if your sober and fall. This is a terrible place to come. Don't spend your money. Find a better coffee shop to go to. This place has lost my business forever. And if they treat everyone like crap, I hope you all won't go back."
1,"Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter. \nI love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit. The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.\nOnce you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register. All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!! The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!! Doesn't get any better than that!! \nParadise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit. \nPut Paradise Bakery on your \""always good\"" list!!"
1,Been going here for as long as I remember. They're like family and always do an amazing job!
1,"To tell you the truth I hadn't noticed that this place changed it's name along with owners, it's because of Yelp that I found out & I pass this place often... So we decided to go back and try them out :\nI like the interior alot better than how it looked before, it's alot more open and spacious. We got a dinner set and I was surprised to find out that instead of the boring California Roll they give us the Stacy Roll instead. \nThe Stacy roll has tempura shrimp,cucumber,avacado,crab,tempura \n& eel sauce. They use chicken thighs for the teriyaki (I like breasts-get your mind out of the gutter-) and the salad was good . What was disappointing was that for around $5.00 you get only 4 gosh maybe 3 pieces of shrimp shumai-now that's too expensive!!! But, everything else seemed reasonable. Service was good = We do plan to come back and try their AYCE."
1,"You know how in some 80's-late 90's movies there's that one new person that comes into class and everyone's like, \""Daaaaaaaaayum!\""?\n\nThat \""person\"" is this restaurant.\n\nI went here last night with my significant other for our anniversary dinner and it was just too good. I got the braised beef short ribs which came with gnocchi and swiss chard (I had the cipollini removed due to food allergies). The gnocchi was so tender it melted in my mouth and had a wonderful buttery taste, some had a more bitter taste because of being placed near the swiss chard. My significant other got the pork shoulder agrodolce and thought it was \""good\"" (his words, not mine.) It had an almost barbecue-like taste to it because of the cannellini beans.\n\nBoth of us got the same dessert, the Torta which was a sponge cake with a coffee mousse, some maple agrodolce on the plate with a coconut gelato on the side. The gelato barely had a coconut taste, but it was very nice and not too sweet.\n\nService was nice, our waitress came at the right time and refilled our glasses and anything else we might have needed. The place is a little small, but I think it adds to its charm. A little difficult to hear the person you're with sometimes, though.\n\nThe only complaint I've really got about this place is that there's some disjoint to the dishes: for example, two of the items on my plate (short ribs and gnocchi) were savory, and then had one extremely bitter item (swiss chard) that seemed out of place. This was the same issue with the dessert--the coconut gelato, maple agrodolce, and cake were all fairly sweet--and then the coffee taste from the mousse and the coffee grounds on the side made for a really awkward and overwhelming taste. I'd much prefer it if the entire plate was balanced, but that's a personal preference.\n\nOverall, I really liked this place and would definitely come back. Daaaayum, Nostrano, you lookin' fine."
0,I paid $13 for a less than six inch sandwich with a bit of cold lobster clumps and two tiny slices of avocado in the middle. The whole thing was super greasy and the lobster mixture tasted very creamy. Not worth the money. I'm very disappointed at this item and this truck.
1,"First off, sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to a bartender and make yourself comfortable. The menu can be overwhelming, but the bartenders will walk you through it and answer any questions you might have. Like tequila? They have a drink for that. What about gin? They have a recommendation for that, too. Even if you don't know what you want, they will have something you will enjoy. Just look above the bar for a seemingly endless selection of spirits. They also have a nice wine and beer list on the wall. If you like cocktails, you will love this place. It's nothing fancy, but it doesn't have to be for people to enjoy it. The drinks are reasonably priced, too. Oh, and they list a \""Yelper of the week\"" on the menu. I hope I make the cut! To Bitter and Twisted, cheers."
0,"General thoughts and conversations throughout the night:\nWhere do we park?\nHow do we get in? I don't see any signs pointing to the entrance. Can we use this gate? Nope, that doesn't open. Why is the entrance only in the back?\nIs this hostess going to help us find our party of 14? No? Ok, we'll just wander and find them.\nAm I really still in central Phoenix? Did Scottsdale invade?\nThis is such a bad idea for the summer.\nWhere's our waitress?\nThis food is so not worth the price. Is there even fish under all this batter? Oh, there it is... I think.\nWhere's our waitress? Why is no one clearing this table? There's no more room to even set glasses.\nHas anyone seen our waitress?\nCould this bathroom be any more confusing for people? Is it unisex? Is it not? Decide!\nThat mystery alcohol grab thing was such a waste of money. Ew.\nI'm tired of waiting an hour to play a game. Let's leave and never come back."
0,Poorly managed. Went in to get a sandwich at 12:25 pm on a Saturday and they had no bread! Maybe they should change their name. Not our first bad experience here. Won't be coming back.
1,What a great new place downtown!  Neighborhood bar comfort. Feels like home.  Wish I lived closer. It would be a regular nightly hangout.\n\nIt's only been open 6 weeks and on a weeknight there was standing room only and the parking lot was full. Local beers on tap . . . plus their own..  Menu included plenty of choices and everything I saw come out of that small kitchen was scarfed up without a crumb left on the plates. . . . and the servings were generous. \n\nAnother great new addition to the continuing eateries and breweries in the greater Phoenix Valley of the Sun. Try it. You will not be disappointed. Wanna meet there for a burger and a beer? Maybe two? Tomorrow night?
0,Essen eher Durchschnittlich \nSchmutzige Tischdecken \nService in Ordnung
1,"We went here a few weeks ago, and I was definitly impressed! This local guy sure does know his food! GREAT FLAVOR, huge portions, reasonably priced. One small nit-the onion slices are huge, and I wasn't a big fan of that. But I recommend you try him out."
0,"Ugh...I absolutely hate this place. Not only do the bartenders dress and look like skanks, but their service is terrible. The security guys are extremely rude. Unfortunately, places are limited ta Westgate so I have been here numerous and each time, there is always something wrong. We were there for an hour, my friend literally tripped and almost fell and we were told that we have to calm down otherwise we will get kicked out, as we were all sitting and talking (at 10:00). Sucky place, go somewhere else!"
0,"For starters, appointments are meaningless.  I understand some delay in seeing a vet - emergencies happen - but the half-dozen times we brought dogs here, we had appointments every time except for one, and they were always at least a half-hour late in seeing us.  More if you count the time when the appointment \""started\"" because we would wait in the exam room for another 10-15 minutes before the doctor came in.  \n\nTo make matters worse, the people who worked the desk were completely unapologetic and downright rude most of those times, too.\n\nI put up with it because we liked the vet we usually saw there, and while the prices seemed high they were also comparable with other Phoenix vets, I guess (how weighing a dog qualifies for an \""exam fee\"" I'll never understand).  The final straw came when one of our dogs cut his paw fairly badly.\n\nRight off the bat, they charged us $60 to inform us that he had been cut (Thanks, doc!)  They wanted to charge us $650 to sedate him and stitch the cut.  They refused to offer any other alternative.  By the time they saw us, the wound had stopped bleeding, and he barely flinched when touched.  Total time they spent with him: 10 minutes.\n\nI was outraged, because I knew glue - or at most staples - would do the trick.  I went to another vet and was completely right.  A few days later the wound was completely healed without the use of sedatives and for many hundreds cheaper.\n\n(I hate feeling like a cheap skate when it comes to my dog's health, but in this instance I knew I was right - stitches and sedatives were completely over-the-top.  It would be like a doctor prescribing LASIK when all you need is a pair of reading glasses - it would fix the problem but wouldn't be at all necessary.)\n\nTo make matters even worse, I thought we'd settled up at the desk of the office.  Turns out not, and without getting a phone call from the office, they turned our account over to collections.  Over 60 lousy bucks that they didn't even earn in the first place - we'd been taking our dogs there for more than a year and they couldn't take the time to call us first."
0,"I grew up going to this theater. All of the amenities are standard and seats are comfortable. However, I am 26 years old. I will concede that I have a young face but getting ID'd at the ticket booth for a rated R movie is mildly laughable. It went from laughable to annoying when a young teenage girl wanted to see my ID and ticket stub before allowing us to take our seats. Just so you know, we were seeing Youth in Revolt not Showgirls."
0,"I will give only one star, but that is even too generous.  We were excited to go and try La Piazza Locale after hearing positive reviews.  It was the worst pizza we had ever eaten in our lives.  We come from an Italian background, my husband was born in Sicily.  They advertise San Marzano tomatoes, but we saw cans of Nina's tomatoes in the hallway.  You can purchase these tomatoes at Sam's club for $2.75 for #10 can.  The pizza was raw and inedible.   No one approached us to ask what was wrong.  We ate one slice a piece, then asked for the check.  The waitress packed the pizza, but we left it behind.  I will never eat there again.  I would highly discourage anyone from eating at this establishment.  I am embarrassed that they would call themselves Italian. Carmela R."
1,"Excellent beer choices and we love the street tacos and black mussels. Aaron L. Was our server and TOP notch all the way. My cup never runneth empty! We are close enough to cycle and when we run the canal, its snack and beer time. Good place to re-energize after a run or cycle ride."
0,"Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa make this fatty sad. :(\n\nThe real tragedy is that the chips seemed to be served to rich patrons in giant margarita glasses, and that looked really fun."
0,"My first Yelp review and had to give it my thought. I eat out often, I can eat all kinds of food, but I must say for $135 for a 7 course meal I would expect top notch food.\n\nWent for the 7 course meal for 135 per person for memorial weekend, I picked the top selections of the 7 choices per menu recommended.  3 out of the 7 was good but nothing great.  I gave 1 star just because it is a fancy restaurant above Palms casino.  Second star for appearance of food.  Service is ok, I can't say is great.  -1 star for overall value and experience.  The service they keep filling water and did say what we got served.   Personally I do not recommend this place for the price.  I went to Bacchanal buffet at Ceasars palace the next night, and all I can say  Bacchanal blows  Alize away..  Technically cannot compare buffet over a course dinner, but what a waste of $135+tax+tip.  (oh...excellent wine though)  My friend got the 3 choice selection with the lamb, i sampled his lamb and was delicious and did not have gamy taste and was cooked to almost perfection, and tender.  But that was his food selection while mine was on the tasting menu.  \nI'm not sure if I went at a bad time, but all I can say is I wouldn't be go to Alize again"
0,I work in the Rotunda building so I go to Village Tavern for lunch occassionally.  The food is just okay - nothing spectacular but nothing awful; I guess I'd say it's average.  Last time I went I had the crab cake sandwich which was sort of bland and soggy; the time before that I ordered a salad which was also just average.  \n\nTheir service is good and it always seems to be busy during lunchtime.  The patio IS nice if you're having a drink or just want to hang out with friends.   \n\nVillage Tavern is not a terrible place but it wouldn't be my first choice for dining.
0,"I saw Dr. Scraff for 14 years he is a great doctor and his assistance are excellent and respectful, however, his office staff lacks the proper training in customer care or problem solving.  Yes even though its a doctor's office there are certain skills that the office staff must have and this staff lacks it.  If you want a great doctor he will provide you the best care you ever asked for but only go to the Spring Valley office where the incidents with the office staff are kept to a minimal."
1,love this place. really helful and everyone is nice just be patient. Roxanne is awesome she has great customer service and is responsive to emails.
1,Dr. Heather & Megan are the best! They love the kitties and are so knowledgeable.We wouldnt go anywhere else.

0,"Although the repair work was fine, the customer service was terrible!  No communication and very difficult to talk to someone.  I called them on day promised and they said the work was done and give them another hour so they could wash the car and double check work.  I picked up rhe car and it was not washed!  Would not use them again."
1,"The food is fantastic, the prices are low, and the staff is super friendly.  This is my favorite lunch spot bar none!"
1,"It seems difficult to find a coffee shops in Tempe south of the 60. At least two have closed their doors since I've lived in Tempe during the last 5 years.\n\nSolo has filled a much-needed niche.\n\nThey have good coffee. Really good coffee. So good that the owner/barista actually asked me how the coffee was before I left. Imagine that! A barista that cares about his pour.\n\nThe internet is free and fast (the latter might be because it is still pretty unknown... I haven't been in there and seen more than two other customers) and there are plenty of places to plug-in.\n\nThe place has a comfortable feel to it... an eclectic mix of ikea bookshelves, modern photography, vintage records and lamps, and antique furniture pieces.\n\nOne somewhat odd thing: liquid sugar. Out of a little dispenser. I ended up drizzling it down the side of my mug. Maybe its more eco-friendly than sugar packets? I dunno.\n\nMy only gripe: as of early April 2008, they are only open until 9pm, making it an unreasonable destination for a late night of studying or socializing. They say this is going to change.\n\nThey seem to be rolling things out slowly. They do accept credit cards (though a previous review indicated that they don't)."
0,"The gym is dirty and old and the whole place is extremely smelly.  The \""trainers\"" were rude and uninterested in working with me.  When I complained about the trainers I was told they are really just coaches, but that's not what was said to me when I joined and they sold me a pack with a trainer.  Even if they are just coaches, there's no reason for them to be rude.  The staff was misleading with their sales contract and will say anything to get you to sign.  I was told I could switch to a pay in full plan at anytime, and then when I went to do that, was told that's not possible and there's absolutely no one in the company that can help.  In fact, the billing department said, we'll just cancel you membership and send it to collections instead of finding a resolution, and I was willing to pay them!  I'm not sure what I'll do to resolve the issue, because I've been reading other reviewers that said even if you pay them off they won't cancel your contract and just keep billing you anyway.  I would 100% not recommend joining this gym.  It's not a nice place, the staff isn't helpful, and the contract is a nightmare.  There's a 24 hour fitness just a block away."
0,"Not what I expected. The food was nothing special, especially compared to other Fox restaurants. The restaurant itself is a nice place to go with a group of people. The margaritas and mojitos were alright, but there are definitely places to find better in the area. I was not crazy about the food either. \n\nOverall this is not a horrible restaurant by any means, I just went in expecting better food and drink. They do have outside seating which could make the ambiance much better for a larger group of people."
1,"This is my second time coming to Q Bistro and Damon took great care of us. He was constantly checking up on us and it made the visit a lot better. We ordered my favorite the spicy rice cakes, kimbap, the chicken wings and a bunch of other entries that were super delicious. Not only was the service and food great but the atmosphere of the restaurant nice as well. Last but not least the  restrooms are beautiful!!! When the restrooms are clean and pretty you know the place's a keeper."
0,"First off, I'm not normally one to complain...I was a server myself before and know how hard it is to put on a \""perfect\"" evening for a large group.  There is no such thing as perfect, nor do I remotely expect it.  What we experienced at Charlie Palmer Steak at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas however, can only be described as pathetic and insulting.\n\nWe were there for a Valentines Day wedding party dinner with 27 people, with the bride and groom paying for dinner including a wine/beer/cocktails package for everyone.  We were told there was to be an open bar for 3 hours.  For starters, the wedding couple was surprised to find that the setup they were expecting (a standing/mingling area for drinks/appetizers and a separate sit down table for dinner) was not provided.  Rather there was simply a cramped back room stuffed with a table for 27.  Oh well, moving on.\n\nIMO from the appetizers to desert, the staff showed their incredible lack of competence, care and integrity.  Appetizers that never made it down to our side of the table because they didn't distribute them properly (big plates, hard to pass around).  Drink orders (at least 4 requests by my wife and I, and a few from others around us) that went ignored.  Whatever, we took it in stride as we didn't want to complain with the wedding party there - and they did bring wine out a few times during appetizers and the main course.  Small pours however.\n\nFrom there on however, more waiters disappearing without bringing our drink orders.  \nNot responding to our requests for wine.  Making excuses like, \""We're busy preparing the cake, we don't have time to serve wine\"".  What? With all the servers there, you don't have one guy that can pour wine (after you've ignored our requests and empty glasses for the last 30 minutes)?  I was dumbfounded at the response.  \n\nFinally the guy came back around to pour wine...but by the time he made it to my wife and I, he had little left.  He poured about 2 ounces in my glass and then unbelievably poured literally a FEW DRIPS into my wife's glass and then walked off.  NEVER TO RETURN.  From there on, I asked at least 3 times for wine only to have them tell me they'd bring it...when they never did...then ultimately \""sorry, no more wine, serving time is over\"".  What?? \n\nIt gets better.  Then they start serving the cake...only to apparently run out before serving at least 4 guests.  Again, my wife and I...and the Groom's own Mother!  As they are serving coffee and picking up finished cake plates from people right across from us...it wasn't remotely apparent to them that they left many people unserved for cake and coffee.  I didn't say anything because I was just too disgusted/dumbfounded at that point.  At that point I was just sitting back, watching the carnage unfold.  \n\nFinally, another 30 minutes later when we're getting ready to leave (about 9:45pm), the waiter comes over with a bottle of wine and offers me a glass!  What??  After all that, you now offer it??  I promptly told him, no thanks, no longer interested.  I had literally \""lost my appetite\"".\n\nIn the end, I feel like these guys took attention away from what should have been a more enjoyable wedding dinner party.  IMO, they RIPPED OFF our friends who paid $250 PER HEAD to have an open bar, wine and beer service.  IMO, they added insult to injury with the way they handled things.  This was literally the worst \""fine dining\"" server experience I have ever had and I feel inclined to share this.  I will never step foot in another Charlie Palmer Steak house.  These guys were absolutely terrible.  I strongly urge you to reconsider hosting any dinner parties at this establishment."
1,"What can you say? There is a reason this hotel has 4 stars.  The attention to detail is unparalleled on the strip.  Rooms sizes a re massive, massive, massive.  You won't be dissapointed!"
1,"My son is three years old.  He isn't quite ready to run around in the 'climbing structure' on the first floor.\n\nI have learned to take him straight to the third floor, which is perfect for kids his age.\n\nThere is a large \""styrofoam noodle\"" forest hanging from the ceiling.  He spends lots of time in there bumping through stuff.  One end of the third floor has a dual race track thing - he runs to get the cars, takes them to the top, lets them go, watches them, and then repeats.  \n\nHe can go back and forth between the noodles and the race cars for over an hour.\n\nOn the second floor, they have some excellent \""art projects\"".  I don't know the schedule for this, but there has always been something happening while we have been there."
1,On my last day of vacation had a truly memorable brunch.  Loved the Two Pear cocktail.  Had a Sunsplash too.  Truly found the carpaccio so good.  The prawns stuffed with crab was the bomb !  Had the cookie plate ( hot fresh baked cookies ) with homemade ice cream.  Great combination......why don't others copy that.\nWas fortunate to sit in the patio outside......in nice weather....do it if you can.  Rarely give anything five stars.  Highly recommend it.  Great waiter too.
1,"I came from Fresno CA on a visit and my Lola was not feeling well. Dr Sabharwal came highly recommended by a friend. She was very calm and comfortable while there. Even though she hates her nails being cut and was quite difficult, she was very happy and feeling so much better afterwards and after getting her allergy shot. She loved the Dr and made a new friend. Prices were great which is always a concern when you have to take your animal to thw vet."
0,"I can't say I had a great time here. A bit pricey and not a lot to show for it. If you're planning to trade in your clothing and accessories for cash, know that they pay lives up to the title \""cheapskate\"". $8 cash for a bag they resold for 9 times what they paid me? Give me a break."
0,"Wonderful place for drinks, the view and vibe. He food was not good! The only item that we order and enjoyed was the cheese and meat plate. The chicken and waffles was a joke, looked like it was made 2 days ago and reheated for us. The waffle was not even as good as a frozen waffle you get at the market. The blueberry salad was horrible and the steak that accompanied it was not delicious. We then ordered ice cream, which according to the waiter is handmade. Well actually it tasted just like Dreyers ice cream from the market. \n\nThis restaurant is a joke and I am surprised that the Four Seasons management maintains a restaurant like this on the property. \n\nCome here for drinks and the view but don't expect great dinning."
1,"Absolutely luv this place! Tina is my go-to manicurist & she's amazing! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails, always friendly & we talk the entire time! Lol I'm glad I found this place!!"
1,"We booked this hotel in early June using a Facebook offer for upgraded room.  $85 for the first night (Sunday) and $68 for the second (Monday). While this would seem like a good deal, add in tax and the mandatory $25 per night resort fee and the \""deal\"" disappears.  Since all of the Vegas hotels are doing this, I cannot hold this against the MGM Grand specifically.\n\nWe stayed at the MGM Grand at a time when the hotel was undergoing a major renovation.  However, this did not really cause any inconvenience, and the hotel staff gave ample time when notifying us that some services might be affected during our stay.\n\nThe room itself was VERY nice.  Large, comfortable bed, very clean.  Great view.  Hallways very quiet and no noise whatsoever from adjoining rooms.\n\nWe did visit the Grand Buffet and I have to say that this particular buffet is not as nice as buffets at nearby hotels.\n\nWe did like the new M program offers by the MGM Grand, especially as it is accepted at all of the MGM-owned hotels - and on the Vegas Strip, that's a lot.\n\nOverall, while we would consider different hotels during our next visit (just for variety), we would definitely stay here again."

0,"Luxor, hmm...i will TRY to be nice with my review because this place was...at the end of the strip. HA! The rooms are small and dark and the hotel is completely confusing. Very comfortable beds, not that I spent much time in them. The Inclinator (elevator) is an interesting experience. It's connected to mandalay, but you're not close to the rest of the better casinos. The buffet was certainly decent enough. The pool area was nice, not overcrowded. Overall...eh, ok."
0,"This is a \""halfway\"" review because we didn't order any food at the Livng Room and will never go there to eat. My husband and i stopped in on a Sunday evening. It was monsoonyish out so there was no one seated outside but the inside was busy. The bar was full and the tables in the main food area were almost full. We had fun. It was a great place to people watch. The music was excellent. A female singer. But in watching people we noticed that the service in the restaurant was horrible. There was one waitress that we were enthralled by because she looked like she was about to kill herself and moved like a snail. We watched her try to smile at a customer and it was... well.. sad. Our server was the only server in the bar. She was literally running and it was still slow. There were two servers in the food area and they were both really slow moving. the one who didn't look like she wanted to kill herself sure did't appear enthused. And the wine by the glass list is just \""okay\"". Nothing interesting on it. Just some basic mid range wines. This is a good happy hour place. Somewhere to get drinks, watch single people (or married ones who wanna be), have some laughs. But it doenst look like a dinner place."
1,"UPDATE: after eating here 10+ times since my initial review, I really like this place. Their tacos are excellent, as are their gorditias."
1,"I am bumping District up to 5 stars.  Why you ask?  The Buffalo Sloppy Joe with tater tots.  That's why!  De-Lightful.  It came on this buttery/potatoey bun and was the perfect mix of sloppy and tasty.  The tots came in this little cast iron pot.  They were great, although I did find myself longing for about another 100 or so.  I was also able to sample the tomato soup my lunch companion had ordered.  Very delicious as well.  Plus they are open for lunch on Sundays.  Most places downtown were closed.  I heart District!!!"
0,Food was pretty standard.. Almost $60 for two of us not including the tip. Our wait to be seated was about an hour. They were missing quite a few items that you would usually find in an outback steakhouse in your neighborhood. As to be expected in the strip the prices are more expensive. I would pass on outback.. might as well hit up something you wouldn't find in your neighborhood if you're going to pay almost as must as some of the other restaurants in the strip.
0,"Blizz Frozen Yogurt is a disaster. We woke up early in the morning, and finally made it here, to find a small line. When it was my turn to order, the person the register, was very rude, and did not let me order what I wanted. On top of that, I had to shell out $13 just to get a crepe. We sat down, and waited 1/2 hour just to be told, \""oh, your next.\""\nDon't come to this awful place, save some money and go anywhere else."
1,"Having opened up as a replacement to the Noodle House, and retaining many of its features, Happiness is a Chinese restaurant hidden in the centre of Edinburgh.\n\nFreshly revamped, with a traditional Chinese and yet modern d\u00e9cor - Happiness has a friendly atmosphere, mostly due to the lovely front of house staff.\n\nFood is well priced, and with a vast menu there is plenty of reason to return. However, food takes a while to appear despite the restaurant being mostly empty.\n\nHappiness also does delivery/ collection take away food from its main menu, which is ready quickly and arrives hot.\n\nHappiness is a lovely restaurant and the food is excellent."
0,"This place has completely horrible service. They come to your table about a minute after you sit down, and if you aren't ready to order - they won't come back for another 10 minutes, unless you can somehow flag one of them down [ but they usually pretend not to see you].\n\nTheir drinks are mediocre at best. And they don't seem to cook their boba on a consistent basis. They also have a minimum purchase amount for each person at the table. And you get charged a two dollar fee if you don't meet it.\n\nThe only reason I really go here, is because it's one of the only places in town where you can get boba after 9. Other than that, I wouldn't waste my time."
0,My wife and I stopped in here last night. We were seated promptly and our server took our order right away. We each had the baby back ribs. Both our orders were burned and the server never came back to check on us. It was the manager who finally came over and we sent our ribs back and he did refill our drinks. Not a very good experience.
0,"If all you need is a place to lay your head, and maybe some friend's too, then you can't beat it for the price and location.  But yes, you get what you pay for!  \n\n  So a classic room here is about $20 a night on weekdays and $90 on the weekends. Just remember the cool extra frills are not included.  Honestly I'd give it an extra star if it just had free wifi.  \n  \n  The room itself was adequate, but the drains in the shower and the sink backed up.  Maybe in a nicer place it wouldn't be so gross, but there's something about standing in that shower water that just feels a little bit dirtier.  Like many other hotels on the strip there is a light hike involved to get from the parking garage to the front desk.  Keep that in mind if you brought a lot of luggage.  Otherwise, it's a perfect place to make \""base camp.\""\n\n  Have I stayed in nicer places?  Most definitely.  Would I stay here again, probably. ;)"
1,"Best doughnut around by far!!! Forget about the toppings, the dough itself is delicious!!! I love sweets and ever since I tasted this treats, I can't get enough, the staff is always friendly and the owner is really cool if you happen to stop by when he's there, you'll get a free sample :) i recommend this place 100%"
1,"Wow...where has this place been all my life? Or at least since I moved to Phoenix :) By far and away the best pie I've had in the Valley. At Yelp's suggestion, we tried out this joint with another couple and we all had a great experience. Our wait on a Friday night was only about 15 minutes and during the short interim, we hit up the bar for some drinks. After being seated, our very friendly server explained the specials and took our orders. Between the four of us, we ordered olives, Caesar salads, funghi, BBQ chicken and Yukon gold pizzas. Holy schmoly were they good. It is difficult to find crust like that and you can tell they have the right type of oven to make an amazing pie. The large pizza is plenty big for two people and the pizza my husband and I split (the funghi) was ahhhhhmazing. The flavors were bold, rich and oh so satisfying. \n\nThe quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge. Affordable+delicious+great service = a returning patron."
1,"I met a group of friends for dinner here and it was a nice dinner.  I didn't break down in bliss because it was the best Mexican food I've ever had nor did angels and cherubs appear.  It was a nice dinner.\n\nThe whole waiting situation, to be honest, is annoying.  If the bar area was larger perhaps it wouldn't be or if they took reservations but I hate waiting.  It was only because I like my friends so much that I could do it.  (It was all for you ladies....because I love you. ;)) \n\nThe wine selection is ok, the tequila selection is incredible.   Our server was very friendly and attentive and all of our dishes were delivered quite quickly to our table.  The tableside made guacamole was ok...to be honest, my husband makes a better guac.  I think it may have been that the avocados were not ripe yet because it was very chunky.  The queso was good, not nearly as good as the queso at El Encanto.   I chose the enchiladas suizas which was very very rich; to the point where it was too  rich.  Much to my dismay there was little chicken and a whole lot of cheese.  I left half a plate of cheese behind when I was done. I did think it was pretty reasonably priced however, we each paid about $35 for our entree, a drink, and the appetizers.  \n\nThey had live music playing which would normally be a nice touch but we were seated directly next to it and it was very distracting.  I could barely hear my friends over it.  Given the small size of the restaurant and the atmosphere I think the music would be much better acoustic.  \n\nI am sure that during my years living in Phoenix I will return here at some point but I don't know how soon it will be.  I would like to take my husband at some point, if for nothing else the tequila selection, but I don't think it would be at the top of the list."
1,"Pretty nice. Parking somewhat tight but nothing too bad. Common slew of standard shops with a few once i never seen before thrown in for a good measure. Its nice that you walk outside and i think even in the summer its not going to be too bad as it seems there will be plenty of shade. Of course, its super new so everything is nice and clean and all. I would not drive there for miles and miles, but if its somewhat near by its totally worth checking out.\n\n\""I like\""\n\nEugene"
0,"One of their employees commented to me that they are instructed by management not to clean up or buss the few tables in this dinky cafe, \""because the patrons would then expect it\"", rather than learn to do it themselves.\n\nWhen they are busy, they set the just-cooked food on a small counter top that is used by customers for dirty dishes.  Often, you have been given a \""buzzer\"" which they activate when they set your food on this \""dirty\""counter.  At certain times of year, there well inevitably be flies on your food when you pick it up to take to your table, as, weather permitting, they have the doors to outside wide open.\n\nSo, I would say the place is often unhygienic and disorganized, even though it has only about five tables inside.\n\nIn spite of the above, the food itself is quite good.  This is another of the facilities associated with Trilogy that, having a captive customer base, is truly not at all competitive with the \""outside world\"".\n\nAlso, many somewhat elderly residents come into this cramped space soaked with sweat immediately after working out in the exercise facility just down the hall, and are often extremely loud.\n\nAnd, believe it or not, the dinky little cafe has the major walking traffic from the parking lot to the pool running between the tables, so that groups of people in bathing suits and carrying all sorts of pool paraphernalia \""squeeze\"" past you as you are eating.\n\nThis may be the poorest design for a cafe I have EVER seen.\n\nToo bad the place is not better because a really good place would be very busy.  I'm guessing Trilogy is home to at least 3000 in winter and half that in summer, yet this place  often is dead."
0,"Beware of what you purchase from this store, I have a $4000 Babe Ruth autographed piece that was purchased here that is a FAKE after multiple e-mails over the past few YEARS I cannot get them to refund my money.\n\nThis Business was bought out over two years ago by a company called FANATICS...I can tell you that they are a Top Notch Organization that puts the customer first! I sent my complaint to the Regional Vice President and within a few days he resolved the whole thing. He took the piece back and gave me a Store Credit for my Item along with an additional $1000 Store Credit for my troubles. I wouldn't have any problem buying from them in the future, they stand by what they sell and if your not happy they will take care of you and make things right!!! Thank you Mike and Dan for helping me get this resolved."
1,"Simply the best thing to happen to the Phoenix technology community ever, period."
0,"Unfortunately, I have had pretty disappointing experiences with the box office and feel it necessary to warn others.  IF YOU ARE A SEASON SUBSCRIBER, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EXCHANGE YOUR TICKETS OR YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Although they advertise this \""benefit\"" to season subscribers such as myself, they do not have availability and attempt to \""force\"" you to buy more expensive tickets.  This is a sham as far as I am concerned.  In my instance, I refused to pay the difference for more expensive tickets and now am forced to sit in the very last row of the very top floor.  Not a very smart way to treat season ticket holders.  \n\nIn addition, the season renewal process was poorly handled for those subscribers, such as myself, who attempted to change their current subscription.  Despite having to 'renew\"" in April, season subscribers are STILL left unaware if their requested changes have been accepted.  Once again, this is clearly an unacceptable way of handling the renewal process.  \n\nCertainly, a performing arts center of this caliber should be better equipped to handle such matters.  It is disappointing to know they are not being handled properly and  that no one is taking the appropriate steps to make the necessary changes."
1,"I found Volume Salon via Yelp and because of other reviews knew to ask for Maria.  \n\nI gotta say it... She's AMAZING!\n\nI travel for work and am weary of getting my haircut on the road.  I got a full color, partial highlights and a haircut and I'm ECSTATIC with all three.  She asked a lot of questions to absolutely make sure I was happy.  She is very personable and easy to chat with (I don't usually talk much while at the salon) and she made sure that I walked out that door happy.  I wish she could travel everywhere with me!  \n\nNot like I needed it, but just to prove that I got a great hair style?  About ten minutes I walked out the door I got complimented on my hair from a complete stranger.\n\nGo see Maria and you most DEFINITELY will not be disappointed!"
0,Horrible 7$ grown up grilled cheese!!!!!!!!!! I felt like I got ripped off!! I wanted to complian but said oh well. Sonic has better Grilled cheese for half the price!
1,"I am in love with this place. I'm actually just partial to any place that serves Japanese tapas but it's not about that...\n4 stars because I'm not completely in love with everything that I order and that it's really dark so I can't see what I'm eating half the time.\n\nGobo chips: I think this is deep-fried burdock root seasoned with salt and pepper. This was my first time trying something like this so 5/5 because I liked it instantly. Simple and I really like the texture of it.\n\nYuzu chili salmon salad: So delicious! I get this every single time I order. In love with the sauce and the freshness of the salmon and salad together. 5/5\n\nEnoki bacon: Bacon-wrapped anything is just a good idea in my book. This even more so because I love enoki mushrooms. 5/5\n\nMini udon: Not very special or unique. Tasted like most regular udon soup bases but still yummy. The only thing that really stood out and made it a little better were the noodles. They were smaller than regular udon noodles but not too thin and still firm. 4/5\n\nGreen tea waffles: Don't really remember what it tasted like but I do remember being really satisfied. 4/5\n\nGarlic potatoes: Not that special either but I think because of them being bite-sized, seasoned, and deep-fried it makes it addicting. 3/5\n\nEggplant: I loved this! Good sauce and very yummy. Just very oily and was a tiny bit harder to eat because you scrape it off the skin. 4.5/5\n\nSalmon onigiri: plain and kind of blah. 1.5/5\n\nOverall, I love it here."
1,"A truly incredible experience! The Aria is a piece of artwork in and of itself, but I was not expecting the decor of Javier's to be so incredible. The tequila tree, the lighting, the ancient carvings...lovely atmosphere.\n\nThe food was amazing--I'm an avid salsa eater, and can be a bit picky, but it had the perfect bite! I highly recommend the margarita infused with cucumber--I had my reservations, but it was so refreshing, and offset the bitterness of the tequila perfectly.\nThe quesadilla with shrimp and dungeoness crabs was nothing sort of miraculous.\n\nThe service was a bit slow (I was with a large party, and the servers weren't even close to getting everyone's food out on time--we all ate in shifts), and the food is somewhat pricey, but it's definitely a venue to visit."
1,"I LOVE KAYA!\n\nMaking a reservation is best, because they can get busy. Seating is a bit cramped, and you're very very close to the people beside you.\n\nBut the food is to die for. I always get the jerk pulled pork quesadilla. It's amazing and always cooked perfectly. The staff seems very friendly and attentive as well. \n\nBe prepared to spend a bit on dinner, but it's absolutely worth it and the food quality matches the prices."
1,"To be perfectly (and embarrassingly) honest, I started going to Industry specifically because I knew I would not see anyone that I knew there. Sometimes you just really don't want a place where anybody knows your name. Sometimes you want to be a girl, alone at a bar, drinking a bourbon and reading a book. And Industry fits the bill perfectly. It's a good-looking place with a giant bar area and plenty of table seating -- but who cares about that when you want to eat alone? It's not too dark, there are lots of TVs, the music is a mystifying mix of Vampire Weekend, Beyonce and 80s, the servers range from charmingly social to semi-efficiently disinterested (which I'm ok with), the food is decent -- I like the salads and the flatbreads but have heard mixed things about everything else -- and the drinks are interesting. Basically, it's the perfect combination of safe and anonymous, with the added benefit of a competent kitchen. \n\nThe cocktails tend to be on the sweet side and for some reason the person who designed the menu decided to name both a drink and a salad the Menlo Park, which makes for some confusion and seems like a ridiculous oversight. \n\nPricing is reasonable: many menu items are under $10.00. The cocktails are also reasonable but, given the sweetness, not really worth it. Or maybe they are. It depends what you like.\n\nBasically, this is a place I go by myself. Maybe I'd go with friends. And I'd definitely go with a blind date."
1,Date night turned into stuffed belly night! This was such great food! We started of with Tom Ka Gai that was flavorgasmic! Then moved onto Papaya salad and Chicken Panang. We couldn't finish 1/2 the entree but made for GREAT left overs! The service was wonderful. I can't wait to go back!
1,"Decent food, nice bar atmosphere, and a fantastic bartender. She was a short Asian woman who lit up the bar.  Lane or something.  Great hang out spot!"
1,"I've always loved Po'boys but one thing I have experienced is that every place has a different concept for Po'boys.  I have never eaten one in New Orleans so I can only compare it to others I have had, however I have to say I was very impressed.\n\nWe entered what reminded me of the 60's diners back home.  Booths and tables and sparse decorations set the stage for our meal.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who turned out to be the owner's granddaughter.  Gave it a nice family restaurant feel in a city severely lacking in that area.  We were escorted to a booth where another friendly waitress took our order.  She was eager to explain the menu.  We were disappointed to find out they were out of Mac n Cheese, Alligator, and oysters.  I settled on a crawfish boudin sausage po'boy and a corn fritter appetizer.\n\nThe fritters were actually light and full of corn flavor.  The side of a ranch like sauce was not even necessary as these fritters had just the right mix of flavor and spice.  \n\nThe po'boy was really good, the sausage was in casing like a good sausage should be.  I was hoping for a little more kick but it was definitely a good tasting sandwich.  They don't drown their po'boys in sauce either which is a positive.  The cajun chips were very good as well.  \n\nI will be back to try the mac n cheese and alligator but I was definitely impressed on this visit.  The owner is from New Orleans and clearly takes pride in her work.  It was just like I pictured eating at someone's home in the Big Easy would be.\n\nStreetcar is a welcome addition to the downtown area."
1,So much fun!! My only real complain was that our server never came to get our drinks even after I asked another lady to bring our server over. My mom kind of missed the opening because she was waiting at the bar.\n\nYou also get a poster if you check in on yelp! Sadly I left mine in the hotel room by accident. But I got an amazing picture with them which is far more valuable ;)
0,"I've been disappointed by this restaurant many times now and have finally decided that I am never eating here again.\n\nOn multiple occasions I've had horrendous 30+ minute waits for takeout food despite arriving after the time they've listed on the phone.  One time, my girlfriend was ignored by the staff for ten minutes only to annoyingly find out that our food had been sitting on the counter (getting cold) the entire time.\n\nMost recently, after another thirty minute wait despite arriving after their estimate, we finally got our food and went home only to realize that half of the order was completely incorrect.  Waiting over an hour for incorrect food is completely unacceptable.  I will never be returning to this place due to their terrible service."
0,"I've been here twice. The first time I don't really remember the experience, but my friends said it wasn't that good, so I'll take their word for it. The second time I ate here was just YESTERDAY so I remember it perfectly. I came to Cafe Lago for lunch with my family yesterday.\n\nBut before I get into that, I'll just say that depending on where in Caesar's you're coming from, I felt that Cafe Lago was IMPOSSIBLE to find. I was annoyed that there were no signs directing you to the buffet. Also it was a Tuesday that my family and I were first trying to find this place. It took us almost an hour to find because they had no signs and we had to ask like 3 different people. The 3 different people pointed us into the direction of the restaurant and when we finally found the restaurant, there is a sign out by the entrance that said that the buffet is CLOSED for lunch on Tuesday and Wednesday. I was so annoyed because I was wondering why none of the people who directed us couldn't tell us that? It was just very frustrating.\n\nANYWAY, we come back to Cafe Lago on Thursday just to try it out. When we get there, the line is pretty long... it's weaving around and everything but we still get in line. We wait in line for about 20 or so minutes. I'm thinking the place is good because there was a long line. Well, we finally get to the front and are following the host to our seat. I'm looking around the room and wondering why there is such a long line to get in.. there were so many seats AVAILABLE. \n\nOnce we are situated and everything, I get up to get food. I probably only ate one full plate and some desserts. Normally at a buffet, I eat about 2 full plates and half of a third (I'm pretty thin but I eat a lot). The reason why I didn't eat as much this time, because the selection of food they have there isn't that much... I was pretty disappointed and I definitely prefer Paradise Garden Buffet (in Flamingo), much better than this one.\n\nI want to say that I was most impressed with the desserts here, even though the desserts look pretty much the same in all the buffets. These desserts had their own little area away from the rest of the food.\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure I won't be back here for a long time."
0,"Overpriced food, and definitely nothing special. I ordered a Chili Cheese Dog and firmly believe I could of got a better one on Freemont for a quarter of the price ."
1,Great one on one service and transactions. You'll have to set an appointment first but they have THE best prices in town. Totally worth it.
1,"Love firehouse Subs! Been going there since there grand opening! Went yesterday to get my Free Birthday sub! Had the new Sweet Thai chili pork Sub, a new favorite of mine. Jenifer made my sub with sauce on the side, for the reason in the past when I had it to go and got home the sauce was all on the outside and made bread soggy. Thanks Jenifer for a perfect meal on the go! And your sweet smile and great attitude while working!!! :-)"
0,"You can do much better than Bartolotta in Las Vegas.\nI go to a lot of restaurants and usually do not write reviews but I had to say at least something about this one.\nIt's a very expensive restaurant so my expectations were very high. I went there with a couple of guys from work and each of us had an appetizer, some fish and a drink or two. While appetizers were good, the food was not worth the prices. I am pretty sure my mother-in-law prepares fish better and your mother-in-law probably does too. \nUnfortunately, I don't remember all the dishes we ordered but I clearly remember walking out of a restaurant with a total bill of $380 for 3 of us.\n\nOn a positive side the staff was nice and a learned a lot about fancy Italian fish."
0,"I have noticed that lately the food and service are getting worse and worse. ICE cold mashed potatoes, burnt hashbrown casserole, slow service and not getting refills on time. Seems each time we go it gets worse and that is all locations."
1,"Had an awesome chicken pita here yesterday. Food was great, service was a little slow though. I liked the patio seating!"
0,"Hated it. I can see why some people liked it, but from the moment I walked in I was ready to leave.\n\n1) When I walked in I approached the hostess to ask about the party I was meeting. I didn't even get a chance to speak. She Shoved the card and menu in my face, said some things, and then moved on to the next person. \n\n2) The card system- I don't like having to get up to go get my food. But even beyond that, I hand my card to the person behind the counter who swipes it then goes back to cooking. With all my germs and who knows what else from the floor and other people on his hands. Made me not want to eat.\n\n3) The food- I didn't like my food at all.  I had the verdure pizza, and it just wasn't good. There was very little cheese on it and there were too many large, heavy vegetables for the thin flimsy pizza slices.\n\n4) Layout- They had my party in the front of the restaurant, which meant we had to walk to the back for our food, and keep going to the far corner of the restaurant for our drinks. Inconvenient. They also had us at a table with stools, which was extremely inconvenient because the stools were so tall and many of us were so short.\n\nI won't be going back."
1,"Pretty Tasty!!  I loved it!  A little on the pricey side, but overall we enjoyed it.  We had a nice evening, nice atmosphere, looks kinda slow for them perfect for us :D.  awesome waiter \""David\"", good service answering all our questions .\n The food was full of taste, and  I definitely will come back soon!  We put in a good word for the restaraunt, and the waiter.\nThat definitely makes a big difference!  Way to go\nIts funny how people gives 1 star just because \""ohh i think my soup is not the same today \"" ....    Keep it up guys!"
1,"So excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and tasty. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff. \n\nThe things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu. \n\nService was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait. \n\nWendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!"
0,"BE WARNED: DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY, they are a complete sham. The owner came out to do a mold testing for me in a house that had prior mold issues. She quoted me $140 for testing NEVER MENTIONING any other fees even though she knew I wanted air samples. She did not even use her easy to use moisture meter UNTIL MY REALTOR ASKED at the end of her test, which then she went and did on the bottom baseboard area which makes no sense as the water breach came from above the basement walls from the ground level. She then proceeded to tell me I would need 5 air samples which made ZERO sense as I specifically requested a sample from the known area of mold. She kept insisting it wouldn't be valid because of air returns, to which I replied that if there's mold indication there, I don't need to know about the rest of the house (which had no problems with water, just the basement). After realizing I wasn't falling for her scam (which would have been an addition $290), she agreed to taking only 2 samples, from the known breached area and outside. \nWhat a waste of money. You live and learn, but I had to pay to learn what a scam she was. I never do yelp reviews but I hope to spare someone else from using her because not only did she not know what she was doing (she missed a water breached area that my general inspector caught 2 days later), but she's a complete rip off. Be warned, I'm not a disgruntled customer as this is clear and simple mold testing, I'm an educated consumer who just wants others to know that you will NOT be getting quality testing or honesty."
0,This is one of those mediocre Indian restaurants that reek of complacency in just about everything they serve.I feel sorry for residents of Madison because there isn't a single good Indian restaurant in this city so they obviously don't know what they are missing out on.Fortunately 3 hours away in the city of Chicago you have the best Indian restaurants in the country AND cheap too.Thank god for that.\nThe meat here isn't the best quality and definitely not fresh.Its frozen chicken.The biryani is a joke and more like a pulao.Service is slow but what will shock you the most are the prices.Wayyy overpriced for the mediocrity they dish out.Any Indian restaurant worth its salt that serves classic non-vegetarian food will NOT have south Indian cuisine on the same menu.That to me was a dead giveaway that food here was not going to be good and was I right.\nAfter dinner they were thoughtful to serve hot towelettes to wipe our hands with but one whiff and you could literally smell the dirty water they were washed in.Absolutely terrible experience.Will not go here again.
1,"Moved here from LA after seeing the same colorist for over 7 years. I was terrified to try someone new after so long with the same person and I have found the transition easy, stress free and been happy with the results here. Both Ryan and Tyler have done a great job on my hair. \nRyan is a great colorist, stylist and Tyler also does great updos. Really nice guys too.  Great location and great selection of products. Almost a year now and never anything but good experiences here. \nI highly recommend."
0,"I really like the food at Grimaldi's and the service in the dining area has always been excellent.\n However, service in the bar area is disappointing at best. It's a regular spot for me and my clients simply due to location. But I'm not sure I will frequent it again. After repeatedly receiving horrible service, I think I will find another spot where my business is appreciated.\n The past 3 times I was there, the bartender girls ignored me. I was seated at the bar with clients. I had to yell across the bar to order a glass of wine. we had 3 drinks each and each time I had to get her attention this way to get a drink. Not once did she ask- \"" Would you like another drink?\"" Also, I had to fight to get her attention just to get refills on water too.\nWhat really bothers me is that this is a service oriented business. We are great tippers. I'm in a business where good service is handsomely rewarded. Do the bartenders there not realize this? \nI'll never go there again. Either management needs to step up their game and train these girls properly or risk losing regular customers."
0,The worst sushi place I have ever had in life....
0,"This place is a joke they think their burgers are made of gold...  I wanted to like this place but the truth is no matter how good your burger is paying 17 dollars for a half pound burger fries and a small drink is ridiculous.   It is just like the overpriced indulge burger that used to be in this location that closed down.  I will not be coming back here as I don't like paying ridiculous prices for things that are not that great to begin with.  The bun is super small,  the burger is greasy,  non seasoned and tasteless for only 10 bucks.  I guess the fries are okay for only 4 bucks more.  Then you pay 3 bucks for a cup that holds about 5 cents of soda.   I don't see this place being here long."
0,"Thank goodness I don't have a car anymore and don't have to deal with these clowns.\n\nBack when I moved into PGH, I did have a car, and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood (N. Oakland).  Go figure, when I went to the office to do so, the meter I first tried to park at was broken, and wouldn't accept any of my quarters.  (This is back in the day when the old meters still existed.)  I should have recognized this as a metaphor for PPA's dysfunctionality.  As it were, I just reported it to them.\n\nAs anyone who's ever been to N. Oakland knows, parking there is a real PITA, and the street that my apt. bldg.'s on doesn't even have parking.  One day about two weeks later, after parking in one of my normal spots, I went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield.  \""What the heck?\"" I thought, since I had my residential permit prominently displayed.  Turns out I was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk.  I wasn't aware this rule even existed, but apparently, it does.  Way to welcome me to the neighborhood, PGH!\n\nSince I was new to town and I'd heard that PGH parking court is a joke, I decided to contest the ticket.  It took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date, since you couldn't schedule one yourself through their website.  I scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month later.\n\nBefore I was ever able to go to court, a flood happened and totaled my car, making me even angrier about the situation.  I went to court with the plan of asking for leniency, given that I was new to town and newly carless.  When it was my turn, I took one look at the judge (a portly and stern-looking elderly woman) and knew I wasn't going to get off.  I didn't even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off.  \""It isn't our fault you didn't know the rules and that your car's wrecked,\"" she said.  Good thing I had enough cash on me to pay the fine, since I don't think they even took credit cards.\n\nDon't believe the stories about PGH parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket, regardless of the reason for it.  That court is a kangaroo court and they're out to do one thing--make money.  Be aware of the more obscure laws, which include not only parking too close to crosswalks, but also head-in parking only.  Check the parking signs carefully, feed the meters, and observe the time limits, and hopefully, you won't have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots.  You've been warned.\n\nI won't even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in Oakland...  Their slogan, \""The Value Parking Network,\"" is laughable and downright disingenuous."
1,The most delicious Thai Dish I ever tried was the Spicy PUMPKIN Basil with chicken from Lao Thai. That Kabocha Squash (Japanese Pumpkin) has the taste of a chestnut mixed with sweet potato. The sauce is a very balanced sauce with perfect spice heat the right amount of sweetness and flavors to knock you out. We also had the Pad Ga Pow and that one was good as well.\n\nLao Thai uses Thai Chilies in their dishes instead of jalapenos for a more authentic taste and features many spicy dishes and also seafood. I do need to mention the portion we just had was smaller than other places and had less protein so if you need  leftovers this is not for you.\n\nLao Thai is among the cleanest of restaurants I've been in. It was a pleasure dining here.
0,"I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\n\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  \n\nWhen the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  \n\nThe food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great."
0,"I used to get Jimmy Johns all of the time when I was down at the good ol' UofA, so now that I work on Mill I was excited to try them again!\nI don't know if this location is different, if my taste buds have evolved since I was 19, or if I have to be completely shit faced to eat here, but this place is ewwwwww\nLike others have said, they use way to much mayo. WAY TOO MUCH. And no other condiment really... Their subs consist of 90% lettuce/sprouts, 8% mayo and 2% misc(meaning mystery meat, tomatoes, maybe cheese, etc)\nI just don't get why anyone would want to eat here? Unless they're drunk! I would totally eat here drunk, but then again, I'll eat ANYTHING when I'm drunk..."
0,"UPDATE: This past time was the second visit and the worst out of the two. The first time was pleasant enough. The patio has a great atmosphere, especially when the weather is nice. The beer selection is decent and the food is alright...depending on what you get. Last nights visit was with a sub par waiter that seemed to be across the board with the whole crew that was on. Everyone just seemed blah to be there. The live music was really, really good but unfortunately we sat in the bar and didn't get the nice patio/live music experience. I got the green chili chicken sandwich and he got the fish and chips. Both were just OK. *Tip: DO NOT order the meat/cheese board. It's $15 and just looks like someone ran out to Safeway and bought some packaged salami and pepperoni and cut it into quarters. Very disappointing."
0,"My mother has had a Swarovski bracelet for some years, which she bought for about $250, and the clasp broke. She took it to the Swarovski store, and they sent it off to the factory for lifetime warranty repair. The following month we called the store to inquire about the bracelet. Surprisingly, the store has no way to track what was sent for repair  to the factory. We were assured, however, that it was a good sign that we didn't get a call. Three months later on my mom's birthday, we received it in the mail with the following letter:\n\n\""Dear Swarovski Enthusiast -\n\nThank you for the opportunity to evaluate your Swarovski repair. Unfortunately, we are unable to restore your design to its original sparkling condition.\n\nWe assure you that this is a rare occurrence and hope that you will remain a Swarovski enthusiast.\n\nSparkling regards,\nSwarovski Sparkle Center\""\n\nIf you buy an expensive piece and it breaks, good luck."
1,Came in the am for my free coffee on opening day!  I am a first timer and I can say I'm officially a fan.  Employees were all very friendly and I even took a selfie with them!  Love it!  They were all smiles.\n\nMusic was loud but that makes the environment fun.  I had the Cocomo on ice and it was very good.\n\nThis compared to Starbucks?  Both are equally good and close to price.  I like both.\n\nCan't wait to try more!
1,"I \""YELPED\"" to find the phone number that wasn't in my phone for some reason and was dismayed to see the negative reviews.  I was unable to see my regular tech, but Carissa is just as awesome as Senthia. I had one of the monthly special pedicures and the new Shellac treatment to my nails. Senthia had recommended it bc I am so rough on my hands and have excess oils in my nailbeds so traditional polish doesn't last too long. \n\nThe only problem I could see today, were the other patrons, one screaming on her cell phone, the other just screaming in general.\n\n All issues aside, it's still totally worth going because I know I won't get any infection from their pedicure tubs, like others that have \""funk, disease, regenerating whirlpools. I'll pay extra not to get MRSA!\n\nps. I think those that have complained about the older lady screaming at them are just unaware that she can't hear very well and is German, you might just be dealing with language/cultural barriers. I've been going here since they opened and know that she's very sweet and has an amazing story)"
0,"Not at all impressed. I had AMS come and do my backyard a few weeks ago.  I think my money would have been better spent with another company.  Eli was very prompt and nice, too bad he was not the workers who came to my house.  Being in a rental property, I needed my back yard cleaned up.  This was half done.  The trees that they would cut were cut only on one side.  The weeds that they would cut and spray with weed killer, are already sprouting back up ALL over the yard.  I could have bought a weed wacker for the price I paid.  Overall, I will not be calling them again to redo what should have been done already.  Very Disappointing since there were such great reviews on here."
1,"I work just around the corner from this place so I go there fairly often recently. For my money, it is the best. Very reasonable rates and you don't have to mess with a membership, so I can go often when I can, but then may not go for months. I have seen 3 different massage therapists over the past year and all 3 have been fantastic. I don't even request a particular therapist because I know whoever is working will be be great. I prefer smaller, local businesses. I don't have anything against those large chains, but I'd rather go here. Have been going for a year and a half and have zero complaints. I often walk in since I work so close, but they do get busy so I would suggest calling for an appointment. There's no need to spend what the fancy spa's charge to get an incredible massage."
1,"Jinya is a welcome addition to the local ramen scene.\n\nActually, the scene is getting too hot that some of the otherwise good joints have closed down and considering that, Jinya seems to have attracted a solid customer base.\n\nMy favorite so far is \""Tonkotsu Assari\"", as mentioned by Philip T it is a basic, no cheat fare. Tonkotsu Black is also good and rich, but it can be too heavy when I'm not super hungry.\n\nJinya is also one of the closest, most accessible ramen spots from the strip when we have a visiting friend.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with their food and service."
0,"I hate giving a low score review to a mom and pop place, but I write critical reviews in the hope that places like this improve their operations. This was my third visit over the years to Bunky's. I thought the food was unique and adequate so we planned to go there for our annual Christmas family outing especially since our daughter from Kansas City is vegetarian. \n\nWe arrived on time and were barely acknowledged. We were finally seated after a 5 minute wait. Our server was asked what she recommended and she told us that she had started 6 days ago and had never eaten there. The server needed training. She didn't appear when we needed something. For our party of six, the meal finally came and the last entree was delayed. We were not sure why since it was a pasta dish. \n\nNow on to the quality of food. The lamb was tough, the beef was tough. The seafood pasta dish was no big creative endeavor. We cook much better at home. It is an Italian restaurant and we had to ask for Parmesan. Overall we dumped two hours. I am not a beer or wine drinker so that was a very long time to wait for me to get a real cocktail after dinner.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. There is only one shared restroom and when I left it there was a line of 4 waiting to use it.\n\nBunky made our family funky."
0,Great variety and reasonable prices but the customer service leaves something to be desired. I'm never greeted when entering the store and its rare that the sales staff will ask if I need anything. I would shop there more if they had better service.
1,"Great tattoo shop..!! I am from California and traveled\n all the way to this tattoo shop because i wanted a master piece on my back and this is the spot to get great art work. This is a really clean, professional shop and  very welcoming.. Everyone here is extremely talented, they aren't the type you just go to get a tattoo they are REAL artist.. The prices are great for the quality of art work you are getting.. I got my tattoo be the owner Daniel and he is AMAZING.. He is so talented and funny.. I totally recommend this shop..."
0,"The resort is behind the Flamingo resort. The picture of the resort on their web page is deceiving. The pool is Flamingo they let Hilton guests use it. The music was very loud eventhough the property director insisted that noise is constantly monitor. Flamingo's pool close at 5 PM, Hilton's pool is very small. The location of the prperty is great. Beware of the garage, they again share the garage with Flamingo. The elevator location in the garage is located closed to Flamingo property than Hilton. You have to use the walkway from 3 level walk about 1000 feet then walk down the steps to get to Hilton. If you have a problem wirh the resort, don't bother to complaint. The resort director will casually brush off your concerns and cannot admit that there are rooms for improvement. If you like loud music and partying this resort is definitely yours."
0,"Meh is the best way to describe this place.\n\nI wish I could say better - but I just can't.  The food was good - slightly above average.  I do not eat pork but my friends said the proscuitto was good.\n\nThe real disappointment was the service.  We had gone for a friend's birthday and my first impression of the place was \""wow, this is cool\"".  That was quickly replaced with total and utter disappointment.\n\nThe first problem was when I requested the server's reccomendation for a drink - he said the Rose is good.  I ordered a carafe, it was brought to the table and served (without them pouring a bit for my approval).  One sip and I knew it was terrible.  No wonder they didn't let me taste it first.\n\nI asked the server if I could order a Kir Royale because I was quite disappointed with the wine.  He told me that I could, however they could not remove the Rose from my bill since it had been poured at the table.\n\nReally?  You're going to reccomend a wine to me, not afford me the opportunity to try it and tell me you won't take it back when it's atrocious?  Sounds like a great way to sell terrible wine.\n\nThe real kicker was when one of my other friends ordered another bottle of the beer he was already drinking.  Instead of being presented with the beer he asked for, the server brought a Moretti.  My friend pointed out that it was the wrong beer and the server tried to argue with him about what he had asked for before making up some excuse and taking the beer away.\n\nSeriously, who does that?  I probably would have given this place three and a half stars had the service not been so terrible.  Unfortunately it was and the food was not good enough to make up for it.\n\nWe will not be returning."
0,"Unfortunately for Mon Ami Gabi, my rating is influenced largely by the way their staff handled a recent incident that occurred while I was eating there. \n\nWe arrived at Mon Ami Gabi after the 7:00 showing of the Jersey Boys. Our reservation was not until 9:30, but they were able to seat us immediately at 9:15. We ordered the Warm Brie Cheese, which the menu states is served with black pepper honey, hazelnuts, and croutons. While I still enjoyed the dish, there was actually only ONE hazelnut on the plate. \n\nFor our main courses, I ordered the French Onion Soup and my sister ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad. The soup was fine as far as French Onion Soup goes. My sister said the individual components of the salad were fine, but trying to eat all of the different parts together made for a strange taste in her opinion. \n\nWhen it came time to pay, I reached down next to my chair where my purse had been sitting during the entire meal to retrieve my wallet, only to find my purse was not there. I had gotten my phone out of it just a few minutes prior, so it had definitely been there during the entire dinner up to that point. I alerted the waiter of what happened, and he said he was going to get the manager. About 10 minutes later, a manager arrives at our table asking what happened. He informed us that he had only been working there for a month and did not know what sort of assistance they could offer me. I asked if we could view surveillance footage and he said that they did not have the \""authority\"" (according to the actual senior manager of the restaurant, who neglected to address the situation in person with me at all). \n\nOnce we had hit a dead end within the restaurant, security guards from Paris showed up. They continued to ask if I \""was sure\"" I hadn't left my purse in the restroom, or at the show I had previously been at. At this point I was sick of people acting as if it was my fault that someone had taken my property. We filed a \""lost and found\"" report with the hotel, and I went back to the restaurant to be sure there was nothing else they could do to help me out (which they claimed there was not). After all, we were leaving in the morning and my purse contained my id. Getting through airport security without an id is not the easiest task... \n\nYou would think that after the inconvenience of having your purse stolen at the restaurant, they would have offered some sort of condolence, or offered to comp at least our appetizer, but they offered nothing of the sort. No apology, no help. I would not go back to this restaurant for that reason alone. But then, when I finally got back to our hotel, I began to get sick, and I was sick for the rest of the night. Quite the ending to my trip, I must say."
0,"My girlfriend took me here because she really likes the pizza.  It's okay for the price but \""you get what you pay for\"".  She likes it because the crust is doughy.  I don't like it because the toppings are grocery store quality.\n\nThis is a small place kind of hidden away.  We went on a Saturday night and the place was empty.  It was 60 degrees outside and they had entry double doors propped wide open making it really cold inside.  I only think they did this to cool it off for the cooks (but they are not busy cooking anything) but it goes to show you they'd rather make themselves comfortable at the cost of the customers.  Also, as we sat and tried to enjoy our pizza we could hear the loud lady that took our order dropping F bombs in a conversation she was having with another coworker.  Not Professional at all."
0,"God damn this place, another hype restaurant. Let me tell you, I showed up 12 minutes after the opening of business hours, I walk in & the F'n staff isn't saying anything to me, just walking back & forth. Finally I stare down some lady, she looks at me & says \""were at capacity, you need to come back in 3.5 - 4 hours if you want to eat\"" You know what, I don't care how F'n great this place is supposed to be, because that is not good practice, it's ridiculous & any moron who waits that long for food is F'd up in the head!!!! You want good Italian food in Phx.? You aint gonna find it here, because once you drive west of the Mississippi you lose the ethnic flavor & rich history of real Italian food, where you can achieve four star worthy dining at many local neighborhood eateries on a poor man's budget without the hype..."
0,"The service and ambiance are impeccable, and the drinks were stiff. Although my girlfriend said her cocktail tasted like Pinesol, my Old Fashioned was more straight Makers than crafted cocktail, and for how much it cost, I was cool with that.\n\nThe bad... the food!  How can you charge this much for such average and sub-par seafood?  Can't speak for the rest of the menu, but this was our experience.\n\nOur lobster roll appetizer was some kind of room temp lobster salad - good, but not impressive or exceptional in any way.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the lobster mac and grilled cheese with tomato and soup.  The soup was bland and disappointing and the tiny grilled cheese was stuffed with seemingly the same lobster salad as the appetizer?  As for my plate - the bacon wrapped rainbow trout with white beans mixed with short rib.  Beans were essentially tasteless and the 2 bites of short rib were chewy and overcooked.  \n\nBut worst of all - the aforementioned rainbow trout made me sicker than I've ever been, including both in the US and abroad. Spare you the details, but save your money and pay for an decent meal in Vegas - not the vibe.\n\nOf all the restaurants to choose in Aria and the surrounding area, PLEASE go somewhere, anywhere else."
1,This place was fantastic.. one of the best meals I've had in Vegas! The place is beautiful with great views of the Bellagio Fountains which was really nice during our meal. The service was top notch from the hostess to the server who helped us. I ordered a lobster roll it was tasty and way more than I could manage to finish. The french onion soup was also quite good (a pretty big bowl too). For desert we had the bananas foster holy cow it was so good but way too big.. more for like 3 people. I will be coming back to this restaurant for sure next time I'm in town. Can't beat awesome service!
1,"I'm more of a fan of staying near the center of the strip (Aria/Planet Hollywood), but we decided to finally try something new and book a room here. We booked the Bella Suite and the size of the room was perfect. The beds were comfy, the flat screen televisions were nice, and the living room had a full office setup if you needed it (which one of our guests did). I'm a big fan of nicely done bathrooms and this place didn't disappoint (not as good as Aria's though), but I never understood why some of the nicer hotels don't believe in locks for their bathroom doors. My biggest (and only) gripe was navigating through the hotel. We were located in the Venezia tower and we had to take multiple elevators and go down several halls to get to our hotel room (which is not an easy task after a long night of Vegas antics). Also my cousin parked in the garage and that took quite some time to find because of the specific elevators you needed to take to get there. Even the employees gave unclear directions.\n\nThe actual hotel was great. There is a large shopping mall attached if that interests you and also tons of restaurants that are actually worth going to if you are looking to splurge a bit. The crowd here is generally a little older than some of the more \""hip hotels\"" (which can be both a good and bad thing). I'm not a fan of TAO, but the hotel is located close enough to Wynn/Encore so it's easy to go there for all your clubbing needs."
0,"Still 1 star. Service was terrible. You can email as many buy 1 get one free to your customers, but if the service is terrible and I have to track the manager down to get a check and cash me out. Bad news."
0,"The wave roll was pretty good. The other two rolls weren't. The service was terrible, and I got food poisoning. We won't go back."
1,"These guys are crankin' amazing sandwiches out at all hours of the night. Probably the best cheap quick meal you can find at 4am on the strip. Definitely check it out if you're anywhere near the PH and looking for a cheap bite. The lines can get long, especially around the lunch hours. \n\nStrong advocate of the Chipotle Chicken, don't forget to ask for banana peppers. They're so good, I strongly considered smuggling a few of these badboys back home in my duffle."
0,"Oh no no no. I was so excited for a gluten free dairy free restaurant for me and my son that can't have it.  For my family of 4, with my 2 kids sharing a dish bill was $55. Steak tasted like way over cooked ground beef, sweet potato fries were drenched in cinnamon and nothing else. Very strange, my kids were not fans. My boys hamburgers were way over cooked as well and overly salty. I had a teriyaki bowl which was lacking the veggies was mostly rice for $13 and got charged $3 to add chicken and there was literally 5 tiny pieces. I had such high hopes for this place. We will not go back. Ever."
0,"My girlfriend purchased a '12 Elantra from this dealership on January 3rd, 12. Overall, the sales part was fine. We did some haggling on price but came to an agreement rather quickly really. It was the finance guys who ruined the experience for us. Long story short, they tried to rip us off out over over $1100 in extras. This deal was for a lease and they had reduced the amount of her trade, tacked on a $650 for \""etching\"" which they said was a \""paint warranty and was required\"" which we knew was BS from the beginning, and they even tried to absorb the Hyundai $500 Recent Grad rebate! We demanded those items to be fixed, and they did after about two hours of telling is \""it was required\"". Then, after signing the contract and having her father (VP at Citizens Bank at the time) found that they  had still charged the same fees but under different names. After many phone calls and emails, and even making a threat to take the story to 3 On Your Side as well as contacting Hyundai directly (which were very support by the way), the GM (Bill E.) did finally call us and they wrote a check for the amount that was tacked onto the contract. All in all, they did resolve the problem which is the ONLY reason why I give them 2 stars. Bill did also admit when asked if they always try to charge $650 for the optional etching fee, to which he replied No. They knew they tried to screw us and they knew that we were the kind of people who wouldn't just sit there and take it, so they reluctantly decided to fix it.\n\nMy advise would be to know everything there is know about financing and to take an expert with you if you have that option. You may not be aware but there are about 3 dozen different numbers on the purchase agreement which make it really easy to show you that you got the price you agreed to on the car, but then all kinds of extras that are actually option listed as required, and so on. \n\nAfter this experience, I start the conversation with the finance guys the same every time (have purchased a truck and boat since). I start out by sternly saying \""If I find one cent that doesn't belong here, I will walk on the spot...no discussion\"". Then, if they still try it I know what kind of business I am dealing with and no matter what I will walk away.\n\nI think as long as you know how to protect yourself then you can survive this dealership. Just don't count on the whole \""No Bull\"" slogan holding up.\n\nOn another note, there has been a recall on the vehicle so we took it back to the dealer. The were not easy to get an appointment with and when we finally did, they said to schedule another appointment when the parts came in....as if unless they told us we would know when the parts showed up. We waited 2 months before finally going to another Hyundai dealer. There, we found out that the parts they ordered weren't even the right ones anyway. The other dealership got it all taken care of with one simply overnight visit. When the lease expires, we will definitely NOT go back to this particular dealer."
1,"Good service, good guarantees on the car washes and I've been there three times and never had anything less than exceptional service."
1,"For the ADHD afflicted: Good food, AMAZING staff. EAT HERE.\n\nFor those wanting a story/review- \n\nI wanted to take my wife to dinner for her birthday. Get this, I was able to remember her birthday, I remembered to make reservations AND I had my suit clean in the closet!  This Ladies and Gentlemen is my personal trifecta.  \n\nWe walked into Mandy Bay and were greeted by the uber  friendly hostess.  With the dress she was wearing I'm surprised there wasn't a brass pole nearby. My icy cool composure kept my wife from throwing a Krav Maga style elbow to my head. But regardless, the male portion of my brain registered Awesome.(That was possibly an inapproriate thought on a special occasion. I sowwy) Anyhow,  We ended up with the most amazing romantic table in the back of the restaurant, tucked away and quiet.  \n\nOur busser was quick to come by to get our drink orders and our waiter was close behind with the specials of the evening.  We ordered the filet and ribeye with the mac & cheese and spinach souffl\u00e9.  A Few minutes go by and the free wickedly good fries showed up.  BAZINGA! I ended up having to go the little boys room and upon my return I was stopped dead in my tracks by the death gaze from my wife. I mean laser beams, ears with steam coming out of them, the works! \nI looked around and now sat next to us was a table full of screaming satan's spawn. 6 of them and the parents. AT STRIPSTEAK? ARE YOU F'ing SERIOUS?  \nThe death stare got the attention of the waiter who looked over and said we will get you another table:) As he turned, all of our food was coming out. He told the other waiters that we were moving and the food went back.  A few short minutes later we were in our new quiet serene home and the food arrived perfectly. The wait staff and management was amazing. Even if the food was craptastic I'd still come back because of how great they were to us. \nWe both enjoyed our steaks, which were seasoned perfectly and very tender but I still prefer N9ne or Brand for my carnivorous tastebuds. The sides were amazing, the Sommelier was on the money and place was just great. We will certainly be back and we will add it to our nom nom rotation. \n\nEat here, you won't be disappointed."
1,"This was the mansion of Wringley ( the creator or juicy gum) I have personally seen better and bigger \""mansions\"" but it was still pretty nice and neat to see how wealthy people used to live back in the day.. the weird part - small bathrooms and marriage couples had their own separate rooms-  well I wonder how they used to have so many kids then... lol.\n The mansion is located in a hill so the view is amazing, the best thing to do will be going to the tour and eat brunch of diner in one of their rooms. I would totally recommend going to this place if you feel like doing something relaxing"
1,"Authentic, excellent food! Looks like a dive, and the neighborhood is old, but the food and the prices more than make up for that. Obviously a popular place because the line was almost out the door"
0,"Very hard to spend money there. They have a sense of arrogance and not very willing to go out of there way to earn business. For the record I have spent over $10K at this shop and today, they lost me for good. \n\nOn the repair side, you're better off taking your bike to Auto Zone for repairs. Odds are they will know more about repairs and additions then this shop. They screwed up something as simple as pedals on my carbon cranks. \n\nI will be taking my business and all of my friends to a new shop."
0,"I've tried this place multiple times.  It's always been subpar.  The only thing good about this place is the selection of craft beer. Today, I came here for lunch.  I was seated at a dirty table/booth that I had to wipe off before sitting. There were multiple flies buzzing around driving people to swat them away from the food and drinks. I ordered a pizza and was given the wrong pizza.  They took it back and made the correct pizza. An hour after ordering the first pizza, I received a second-rate pizza. The server never even apologized though it was his mistake. Never again.  Overall grade = F"
1,"Yes, I went and had the tacos. YES, the lengua tacos. YES, I KNOW!!! They were good. Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk, along with any kind of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck, you can get those here, too. I'm not sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope, pretty sure they've got it all. Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm and tender, then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story."
0,"I am new to Phoenix and was looking for a really good Chinese place.  This menu showed up on my door and I thought what the hell...well that's what I said after dealing with poor customer service and a dish called \""Dragon and Phoenix\"".  This dish sounded good but had well over a whole onion and very little flavor.  The meat dumplings....mystery meat!  Definitely not potstickers.  The search continues, good luck on your visit to this place."
0,"We were eager to try So-Cal, so last night was the night. Maybe we expected to much from a restaurant that says they \"" want to give you food that you can get stoked about\"". \n\nOk, it started out good. We got the Oysters on the half shell and some of the Mission Brewery Hefeweizen. The Oysters were fresh and very tasty. The beer, cold and refreshing.\n\nI ordered the mahi tacos, and my husband ordered the shrimp tacos. With each bite we kept saying to each other, is this it? We came here for this? We waited 30 minutes for this?  The tacos did not have much flavor. Tacos from Rubio's taste much better. The beans tasted as if they were out of a can, and whats with white rice with tacos? Is that what they do in So-Cal ?\n\nMaybe the cooks were a little to much in a \""California State Of Mind\"" last night, and forgot the seasonings on the fish."
1,"This place was really Chinese - enough that I kind of felt out of place, so I guess you can safely say that its authentic Cantonese food. We got beef chow fun dry, which was kind of funky tasting - not spoiled (I hope) but the beef just tasted funny. The fried tofu w gai lan and fungus was surprisingly good. My Chinese friend said its the only place in town she's found that serves the fungus - interesting, they're chewy and look like mini versions of the natural sponges you use as wash cloths. \n\nFood is cheap I think both dishes were $8 each and you get free soup and dessert so it's a 3 course meal for $8 if you eat in. The free soup wasn't just pork bones and cabbage like other Chinese places - it had big pieces of pork, lotus root and carrots. My friend called it MSG water, but whatever it was free, so no complaints here. Dessert was a warm tapioca soup - tasted like there was bean paste in it too. \n\nThe BBQ offerings look promising, I'm definitely going back to try that sometime. I saw on the menu that they do whole roasted pigs for $200. May need to consider that for the next big party. They also had a baby pig option for I think $160"
0,"Save your money and visit sprinkles for ice cream .\nThis place was pretty bad, it was eye candy and I was drawn in I was excited to see I could build my own ice cream sandwich just like at sprinkles . I was first disappointed by the service I felt rushed and the girl seemed a little annoyed . The second and biggest letdown was the cookies , dry store bought flavored . A crunchy cookie doesn't make a good ice cream sandwich . I took a few bites and tossed it . \nI am in Vegas 8-12 times a year and we stay at the Monte Carlo a lot but I think I will stick with other options that don't disappoint ."
0,"When I am craving Thai, nothing else will satisfy.  My friend and I visited Thai Basil as it was the closest Thai destination to her home, and I ordered my favorite dish of panang curry with shrimp...\n\nAnd I'll lay it on the line... it was pretty vile.  I'm shocked at the numerous five-star reviews I read of this particular location, because really this dish tasted nothing like the millions of other panang curries that I have tasted in my life. It was just so heavy on the peanut flavor, and utterly lacking in any other... and the shrimp were rubbery and almost inedible.  I hardly ate any, so my kind friend wrapped it up, and said excitedly, \""You have an awesome lunch ready for work tomorrow!\"" And I didn't have the heart to tell her that there was no way I'd be able to warm it up.\n\nIt's too bad... they were very friendly, it was reasonably priced, and it was a cute little place.  My dining partner seemed to enjoy her dish... maybe it was just a bad night for the curry."
1,"The service was friendly, the food was great, and the atmosphere is just right for a date night.  No complaints from me.  If you come to Sam's Town, try Billy Bob's."
0,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me!\n\nAs Seen On TV. Have you ever been f***ed over by an informal that turned out to be a scam? Not me. Have you ever religiously vowed to try out Man Vs Food locations with out yelping them first? I have.. :(. Seriously!?! WTF was I thinking!!!! As a Yelp a Elite, I was questioning my status. I thought I should simply resign from Elite for what I did. Had I read one or two reviews. I could have save myself heartache and pain. **WARNING RANDOM RANT AHEAD!! Viewers discretion is advised.**\n\nSTUPID TV! There's a reason I Netflix, so I don't get sucked in to stupid shows and stupid commercials. I wanted to punch someone so bad more than I hate the Verizon \""Can you hear me now guy\"" and the Stupid retarded I'm a Mac commercials with equally as stupid Apple consumers that religious follow the Steve Jobs cult. Adam Richman, men across the nation look at you for inspiration. You are not an Guy Fieri, Andrew Zimmerman, or Anthony Bourndain, but we trust that you are one of us and not caught up in mainstream BS! I have watched your show seeing all these wonderful places on the East Coast and in Texas. My quest for Man Vs Food starts on the West Coast. Los Angeles was a disappointment nothing spectacular like LA traffic, smog, and the Lakers going to lose this year's Finals (or not make it) =). Las Vegas my second home... How could you pick this place?\n\n**Back to the Review**\n\nWhen you first walk in to Nascar Cafe you will see a line. You will hear little murmurs like \""Wow, I can't believe I'm here..... MvF\"" \""blah blah B3 or Big Ass Burrito\"". Two things come to mind when you see this place... Is Nascar really a sport? King of the Hill just came to life! I was waiting for some to say Propane and Propane accessories, but someone did say my favorite Hank Hill line... \""I tell you WHat\"". I felt very very very out of place. Arlington, Texas is alive! I'm surprised I was not mistake for Kan. Okay Okay. I'm being harsh in a joking way of course. I did not drink too much Hater-aid and no one was raciest towards me. I apologize for being a little bitter... but please read on.\n\nAfter a 45 minute waiting with very very impatient people behind me, I was finally seated. Yeah! This is a long time to wait with only maybe 3 small parties in front of me. I did not see any burritos on the menu. What the deuce? I wanted a 1 lb size of the B3. (I found out later you can ask for it, thank you yelp) Instead I ordered a guacamole bacon burger. A Carl's Jr commercial was never more dead on! While eating a \""fancy\"" 13 dollar burger I was wondering why I wasn't eating a 4 or 5 dollar Carl's Jr burger instead. Portions are big but even if I was drunk, I'd much rather hit up the cheaper local Denny's. The curl fries were slightly better than the burger. My friend ordered frozen buffalo wings. Okay, she didn't mean to get them frozen, but they came out almost that way. The chef did replace her half pound order of wings with a fresh HOT plate of 1 lb of wings. Nice up grade for an honest mistake. I tried the wings... Too bad I'm a wing specialist. The wings were hot on the outside, but still slightly under cooked on the inside. I didn't notice this until the wings became cold over time. Come on how hard are wings to make? 10-12 minutes in a fryer and add maybe 5 minutes more if frozen. My burger fell apart while I was eating it. Not in a good mouth watering way, but in a nasty way. If this ever happens to you, that means that the bread is older and the meat was not cooked correctly. I'm not sure how it was cooked... Maybe grilled, baked and boiled?....\n\nThe PROS... There's always a bright side. Despite the slow slow service. My server was actually nice and in a good mood :). I appreciate that. The employee was dragging his or her feet and clearing dishes like they were the bomb squad. I heard a customer say, \""They should fire everyone and hire new people.\"" Thank you to my server. I applaud you :). This place is seriously Nascar Heaven with millions of TV playing only Nascar (and one soccer game). Or the opposite of heaven if you aren't in to Nascar. I could only image what Top Gear has to say about Nascar and driving in circles. \n\nI wish I never set foot inside of Sahara or Nascar Cafe again. If you are a guest of Sahara, I do think you should give this place try. Call me crazy, but the quality is kind of like cafeteria food. Its not great, but its decent enough that you could eat there. I think my review is a tad bias and if your food is cooked by a different chef than today I'm sure you will be fine. Thank goodness I didn't get sick. I'm writing this from my Wynn Suite and I know tomorrow is another day. Hot N Juicy and Hash House A Go Go are next. I think I saved the best for last. \n\n*I accepted any hate mail this uncensored review might have caused. Just know.. please read this review with a light heart and know I was pissed and don't take me too seriously.*"
0,"Hubby and I thought we would try it last night.  I ordered the Angry Shrimp, and he had the southwestern portabello.  This was our fist time, and the waitress had the giggles while she talked and we had to have her repeat what she was telling us.  The Angry Shrimp was OK and my husbands Southwestern was way too salty.  When we told the waitress, she didn't offer to bring something else, nor did she apologize.  She did mention that she heard that complaint before.  I don't think we will be going back."
0,"Bad service high prices. This place gets overcrowded during long weekends.\n\nI went for a lunch buffet, had to wait 30 mins for naan. \n\nIf they want to serve lots of people during holidays they should increase their staff to provide a Better service.\n\nFood is average, very limited options considering the price they are charging.\n\nOnly advantage they have is very few Indian places in town."
1,"I dropped my phone and cracked my screen and they fixed my phone in half an hour. It looks like a brand new phone now! They also offer great deal on yelp and groupon. So try to find their promotional deal before you go. Their staff is friendly and nice, they kept my company while I was waiting for my phone to get it fixed. I had nothing to do without my phone. Fast and quick, a lot cheaper than Apple store. I would recommend here.\n\nP.s this place is kinda hidden it's on the second floor."
1,"Whoaaa, before I dive into my review, do the women that work here have to meet a certain \""good looking\"" quality?  I don't think I saw one woman here that was not good looking and they were efficient with our order...Welp onto the boring stuff ha.\n\nI really enjoyed the environment, it had different types of people enjoying there tasty breakfast.  We arrived before the rush and I was well pleased with our food.   I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, the fresh \nstrawberries and almonds were a nice touch.  DEF COMING FOR MORE Ha."
0,"We went to this place before when it was under different ownership and it wasn't too bad. But this time we were very disappointed. Service was slow. Our hamburgers were tasteless. Very disappointing.  On a more positive note I like how they've added more TVs and I do like the atmosphere, and our server was very friendly. They just need to get a new chef and a new menu."
1,"Swayed by my overwhelming compulsion to be FRUGAL as possible in Vegas, I convinced my girlfriends to have dinner @ Fiamma, prior to our KA showing @ 9.30 pm on a Wednesday night. \n\nMaking a reservation for four a week ahead seemed silly, especially when in every restaurant, it's never full to capacity!  WTF would any one have to wait any more than 5 minutes, I can't tell you, but it beats just standing and doing nothing.  \n\nFour girls from Louisiana and we get David as our server, from Louisiana as well.  What are the odds, eh???  Anyhoo, we all opted for the summer tasting menu - three courses for $45, or with wine pairings, an extra $25 on top.  We didn't do the wine pairing, but I did get the Bellini.  I heart sweet alcoholic drinks and this was delicious!  The champagne wasn't too dry and the peach syrup was refreshing.\n\nFor starters, the girls had Caesar salad and I had the grilled octopus with a tomato and olive and capers type of chutney/sauce.  The octopus was really char-grilled, and at times it overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the protein, but not at all was it chewy or rubbery.  Delicious and tender!  \n\nEntree - the girls had the grilled skirt steak and I had the salmon.  WOW was the steak delicious.  One of the girls commented how this was the best steak ever - tender, juicy, not too salty, just tasty.  And when I bit into it, I almost regretted getting the salmon - it was tasty!!!\n\nThe salmon was fresh and delicious.  It was barely seasoned as the pancetta provided enough saltiness and the corn ragu added a touch of sweetness....mmmmm.....I had to force myself to finish the last bite - still bracing the fact that we had dessert coming as well.\n\nFour choices of desserts and four girls = sharing all dessert!!!  Hands down, our favorite was the chocolate tarfuto - the hazelnuts and dark chocolate poured over the caramel gelato...MMMMM. \n\nThe sorbet trio was fantastic - cantaloupe tasted exactly like one!  Next favorite was the tiramisu - we found the espresso powder covering the delicate dessert to be overpowering, but still tasting.  And the least favorite was the panna cotta.  I think the girls were turned off by the figs, but the almonds and honey really brought out the marscapone in the panna cotta.\n\nNot to mention that David's fellow server, Brian was really hamming it up with us.  Prior to dessert, he sent over some miscotti or dessert wine.  It was SOOO delicious, that one of the girls took my glass and promptly finished it off.  Of course we had to thank Brian for his generosity, and even took a picture with him.  \n\nAnyhoo, Service here was fantastic, the food very tasty.  I appreciated the fact that David asked if we were on a time frame, and even though we didn't make it out in time, I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
0,"I really have no clue where to start. Maybe I should begin with saying that there were no door knobs on the door. Yup. \n\nAfter figuring out how to get inside, we were immediately greeted by a foul smell that was similar to sweaty socks. Not something you want too smell at a restaurant. Normally we would have left, but we had 9pm reservations and everyone seemed to be raving about the food.\n\nWe were seated at a teppanyaki style table alone. After a few minutes another party of 2 joined, followed by an additional party of 5. All guys.\n\nWe got our drinks, gave in our order and waited. and waited. and waited. Finally at about 9:35 our salads arrived. Now, I'm from NYC and every hibachi place I've been too, we've never been longer then an hour. Here, we were already 35 minutes in with just our salads and no chef in sight. The salad was bland and wasn't very appetizing. The soup arrived a few minutes later which was actually really good. Definitely one of the only good things about this meal.\n\nFinally at 9:50, just as we were about to complain, our chef arrived. He noticed I was the only girl at the table and proceeded to make a heart out of oil and say \""Thats for you!\"". I thought it was a kind gesture until I turned around and heard him say \""This is also for you!\"" To my surprise, he was holding a wooden penis. Yes you just read that right. A wooden penis. Wtf. I think I died a little inside, but laughed it off. Was totally turned off by this and I kinda just sat there in shock for a few minutes.\n\nLet me just be the one to say this - I hate when teppanyaki places serve your rice first. By the time any of the other food gets to you, theres no more rice. This was probably the least annoying thing of the entire experience. EXCEPT - for when the penis flashing chef insisted we all try his \""cream\"". Please don't take that out of context. One minute I'm eating my rice, the next minute he's forcing some yellowish sauce type cream on the other half of my rice. I took one bite of it and hated it. \nIt was terrible. Why would this guy ruin my rice like that?!\n\n The food was just completely mediocre and absolutely nothing to write home about. I'll probably never come back, or even ever consider it. I think if I was dying of hunger right outside of this place I'd still consider the gum stuck on the sidewalk then go in and have a meal here."
1,"We did take-out from here and we were so glad we did. The tofu bibimbap was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating it even though I was full and my stomach started to hurt.. I still needed to eat ALL THE BIBIMBAP. Give me BIBIMBAP!!"
1,"David Williams constant twitter hype, long days at the 2011 WSOP, people willing to pickup your food for you.  Nuff said.\n\nThe burgers are creative with strong Asian flavors that really satisfy after a long day of grinding.  Props to the mushroom burger (shitake and wasabi mayo) and the spicy burger (chili infused mayo and kabayaki sauce).   The meat itself is what you would expect.  Its good and cooked well but hey, this is not the Burger Bar and you are not paying $15 for it.\n\nThese burgers are not for everyone.  They are juicy, greasy, basically messy to eat.  Wait too long and the bun is mush. But if you're one of us with the winning \""it's all good\"" attitude, Fukuburger delivers."
1,"Just a pop-in for a cocktail and really loved the vibe and feel.  Started with excellent service, were greeted promptly with a smile and received drinks and menus.  I had a well poured cocktail and my guest enjoyed a very cold beer.  \n\nThe happy hour menu was varied so you could enjoy price breaks on liquor and beer.  The food also looked excellent but as I mentioned, we had to run but I wish we had more time for food.  \n\nNext time, as I highly recommend this North Scottsdale spot if you are in the area!"
1,Love this place! My mom has taken her pets here for a long time and I take mine here too! They are patient and caring! The fact that they can trim my Beagles nails and she has no problems with them whatsoever shows how awesome they are! Good prices too!
0,"I spent the weekend working on a presentation for work, due Monday.  I visit the nearby Fedex around 5:30pm to print my masterpiece.  There is one worker there and she is helping a couple of girls with wedding announcements.  I wait.  10 minutes pass by.  She is sort of casually helping the girls...I haven't even been acknowledged yet.  10 more minutes pass by and I grow impatient.  \nFinally I am acknowledged after 20 minutes. (Yes I was keeping time)  She gave me an exasperated \""What do you need\"".  I want something printed and bound, a five minute job.  She asked, \""when do you want it\"".  I look around, surveying an empty location and said \""now\"".  \n\""We close in 20 minutes and I'm the only one here\"" was the response.  I am baffled, this is a 5 minute job.  I tell her I need this for a meeting on Monday morning and she keeps up with her \""we're closing\""  routine.\n\nSo, thanks for the creative solution my Fedex Friend.  I arrive 30 minutes before closing time and get no help.  Nothing.  One of the worst customer service experiences of my professional life."
1,"Sometimes great restaurants the food will naturally speak for itself.  It will keep customers coming back time and time again, and it's always the first choice because you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and it will always satisfy everyone, no matter how picky of an eater they are.  This place I'm describing is definitely Republic Kitchen and Bar.  I can easily eat here a few times out of the week, always having different things, and sometimes I'm picky about what I want, however I can always say that the food is amazing and I always leave satisfied.  I'm impressed with the quality of the food and the incredible price.  Above all to add the icing to the cake, the service is pleasant, welcoming, and \""going above and beyond\"" to make a customer happy is the experience I always get here.  I'm in the service industry myself, and managing a luxury brand I can recognize good service when it is given.  There isn't many places that I can say the food and service is exceptional, however Republic Kitchen and Bar is both.  If you haven't tried it, please do yourself a favor and join the fan club.  It is such a great place to be, and if trust me you will be hooked like I am.  Go check it out, I'm sure you will probably see me there because I'm a fan of great food, great price, and great service!"
1,"I was in town on business and staying at the nearby  Hyatt  when I found this place on YELP.  Got there at noon and the place was PACKED but the line moved quickly and everyone was courteous and downright pleasant. Got the roast beef and provolone on wheat - custom toppings to my likings and it was delish!  Real roast beef sliced in the spot ! Yelp reviews did not disappoint ! My only suggestion would be to add a multigrain or oat bread option - but otherwise super good, inexpensive and quick. What a gold mine !"
0,"I'd been hearing about DNA since it opened, and was excited when I finally had an opportunity to experience it for myself.\n\nThe ambiance is very original - the lounge area is decked out in orange, and the dining area is a split-level, very open air room. Lots of glass, and the designer light fixtures are out of this world.\n\nThe menu is focused and divided into three courses - an appetizer, and pasta dish, and a main. There were three of us, so we were able to sample a number of dishes. Although nothing was bad, absolutely nothing impressed us. And for the prices, we expected to be at least somewhat impressed.\n\nSame went for the service - one of our orders was mistaken, and I felt as though we were consistently chasing a waitress.\n\nIt's too bad because DNAs use of fresh, local ingredients, and their initiative to use the entire animal is awesome, I only wish it had been better executed."

We ordered edamame, was good...nothing to rave about.  Not much you can do to mess that up.  Drinks were well poured but exspensive for what you got.  Ordered five different sushi rolls.\nAll five were bland, not much flavor and stale.  The fish was not fresh.\nPaid $12 for a soft shell crap roll and it tasted days old.  Will not go back.\nDid here they have good pizza and a happy hour at three.  My daughter says to give it another try.  We'll see... I'll let you know if I do."
0,"I've been going to Tatum Highlands for over 5 years along with my Husband and Son.  Dr. Levins has taken over the practice and he's a really good doctor.  I have also seen Paul the PA and Sandy the Nurse Practitioner. Unfortunately the staff is is completely incompetent and I can no longer receive the care from this office. I have tried repeatedly to have a prescription doctor call me, the office manager and records department leaving over 6 messages for a return call and no one has ever called me back!  Everyone is rude and  apathetic. Horrible Service and I wonder of these three amazing Doctors will ever receive the message that they are loosing patients due to the total negligence of their staff."
1,"Yes, it's still pricey but their desserts are so good.  Now I only go as a treat.  My favs are the iced coffee, I have learned to enjoy the vanilla and the homemade caramel coffee is also good.  The mint chocolate chip macaroon is also great!"
1,Saw Celine last night! She was FABULOUS!
1,"SO excited to have a decent chinese place in downtown that is actually open after 5!  As much as I love China Chili, I just can't drive up there all the time.  Having Hsin around is going to improve my culinary options.\n\nWe went during their grand opening.  I ordered the orange chicken and it was very good.  Some of the best orange chicken I have had, actually.  It was a bit weird though since it was accompanied by a fruit salad and cucumber slices.  Very odd choice of a side.  I liked getting fruit but some of it got the orange sauce on it and wasn't very good.  Oh well.\n\nThe people who worked there (especially the younger girl) were awesome.  Lots of personality and very helpful.  This place will quickly become a take-out favorite of ours."
1,"I am a big fan of sushi and have been to many different sushi bars in the tempe area. I was so impressed by sushi time! First big plus - an immaculately clean and rarely crowded establishment. I am always surprised that there are never many people there when I go - maybe I just go at the wrong time, or people don't know about it, because the place rocks.  You order up at the front counter, and then they bring your tray to you when the food is ready - drinks are self serve also. \nTheir sushi is really delicious and fresh! They make one of the best Las Vegas Rolls i've ever had - make sure to try it if you go. Also, every day they have 'combos' posted, where it's $10.99 for two types of rolls (the rolls in each combo are different every day) and miso soup. For the price, delicious sushi, and clean, modern atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place!"
1,"This is so thoroughly the Platonic ideal of froyo that you will leave convinced that there is a Socratic dialogue called De Froites (\""On Froyo\"") in which Socrates disputes with a bevvy of sloe-eyed, honey-skinned young men about whether flavors such as bananas foster and black-sesame are best reserved for philosopher-kings, lest the masses be lured into decadence.\n\nThe pistachio froyo is straight up amazing: the perfect blend of sweet-tart, with the flavor of real pistachios. If you fondly remember Jell-O pistachio pudding from your childhood but have become appalled at how sweet and processed it now tastes to you as an adult, have the pistachio froyo. It is the distilled memory of pistachio dessert.\n\nThe topping bar is fine -- every place has roughly the same these days -- but the important thing is that this froyo has live cultures, so you can blame your digestive health needs for indulgence here.\n\nHaving seemingly sampled every other froyo purveyor in the neighborhood, I can now settle down to concentrate on Yogurtland's plethora of seasonal and unique flavors."
1,This place is local favorite!  Such a random menu from sushi to Italian food yet nothing disappoints!
0,"Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830. \nMy experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1.\nNext our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead.\nLissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3.\nMy companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4.\nMy tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5.\nNext up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6.\nNot even done yet......\nAt 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes \""when the party is over.\""  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7.\nShe finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting.\nAt 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8. \n I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9\nWhen Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10.\nFurthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, \""Ok they took a dollar off.\""  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11.\nI am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back."
0,"I wanted to like this...I honestly did.....\nYou get sold on the gimmick and I can live with that. so I blow just under $100 for 2 people to each have 2 drinks....They show pictures of beautiful people wearing beautiful furs enjoying their drinks very much like a scene from the end of Spies Like Us...I digress...\n\nYou know the blanket like navy blue butcher jacket worn by that person you only see on the other side of the milk shelf at the supermarket? THATS WHAT THEY SLAP ON YOU. The nicer stuff is EXTRA. They give you some gloves, take your phones etc... and off you go.\n\nCrappy attire aside I ventured in to discover liquids have problems at really cold temperatures...so anything they were making was a slurpee because all non booze mixers were freezing.up. \n\nOK, that tears it for me. Crappy drinks AND crappy attire...I did not feel beautiful. I did not feel like I got anything CLOSE to what I shelled out. This is a photo op joke. \n\nSell what you advertise is my motto and Minus 5 is the classic bait and switch plus you have to explain shrinkage."
0,horrible horrible dentistry! this place tanked when the hurst's left. the cleanings are less than thorough to say the least. its the fastest cleaning you will ever have but not in a good way. \n\ni got stuck with having to have a crown done so they put what i thought was a temp. crown on it. turns out its one they put on kids thats designed to fail and leak because there TEETH FALL OUT ANYWAY!  i never had the crown done there because they held it hostage by not doing it until several other unrelated fillings and procedures where scheduled at the same time.  \n\nbeware though get a second opinion from a different office ( better yet just go to a different one that is not sheisty) before having a crown done. they get very crown happy and told me i would need two other ones. wouldn't you know it my new dentist told me there is no way you should be doing a crown on the teeth in question. \n\nplus to beat the entire thing my family has had 5 different crowns from hurst. all failed within two years because they cant properly attach them.
0,"I honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap \""free range\"" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  \n\nAgain, overall the place is well lit and looks great.\n\nFoodwise....id go somewhere else.  As a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new.  Now i know, i won't go back.  There are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality. Good luck."
0,"Wells Fargo tries harder. Sort of like those rental car commercials years ago. There is so much banter from every one in the bank, asking \""How are you doing?\"", \""What are you doing this weekend\"", blah, blah blah. Overkill in my opinion. Unlike my local bank in Illinois where everybody really cared who you were and called you by name. So I guess what I'm saying is that the big money center bank should just stop pretending about being my buddy and just get on with the transaction. It's only business, trust me. \n\nI guess my bullshit meter finally couldn't take it anymore today. Sort of like when you deposit over $10,000 in cash at the teller window and they ask for your driver's license and start inputting information but don't explain why they need to do that and act all serious about it. Hey, I thought we were friends. So not my favorite bank, but convenience seems to rule the day."
1,"For 25 years I refused to stop in Las Vegas.  Then I read about the vegan options at all the Wynn/Encore restaurants - and decided to make a special stop during a recent vacation in the Southwestern US.   The Terrace Point was the first Wynn/Encore restaurant I tried, during a quick lunch stop at the beginning of my vacation.  The reviews I'd read before departure did not lie - this is a tasteful casino; the vegan food is outstanding, and all the staff enthusiastically promote it.  I liked it so much I decided to stop back at the Wynn/Encore complex for a night (and two more meals) on the way back home at the end of my vacation. Will definitely make this a destination, not just a stopover, for future vacations!"
1,Mike was our server he was knowledgeable great personality very attentive the food and his service was awesome.  We will definitely be back and ask for him.

0,"I like the fact this gym has 4 basketball court as it is very needed in the city of Las Vegas. I'm here maybe 3-4 times a week. Our basketball teams takes part in the Asian League on Sun, Mon & Wed. \""pLaYhOuSe Basketball\"" it's great that these court are open late. We hold practice from 10:30pm-12:30am. I believe it's the only gym that's open this late. \n\nReason for not giving it 5 stars are\n-Parking sucks, not enough parking\n-Parking area is way too dark (not safe)\n-NO WATER FOUNTAIN \n-A couple of the over head lights are out and it makes the courts look very dark while playing"
0,"Less than one star - I live here and the staff is terrible.  The apt above me had a water leak and ruined my ceiling, crown moulding, carpet.  It has taken them weeks to do any repairs and recently lied about mold testing when I requested it.  My carpet stinks and they just painted over the sagging, stained smelly ceiling.  The staff is rude and far from helpful.  Now I have an ant infestation and they haven't even tried to correct it when asked.  \""they are handling it in the order received\""  meanwhile, my kitchen is infested.  This place is  \""THE SLUMS OF SCOTTSDALE\""  - it's not cheap to live here and wish I had never stepped foot in this craphole."
0,I decided to try Hungry Howie's on a whim.  Eek! Me thinks never again!  The pizza was very bland and not something I would recommend to any of my friends.  I would say some of their sandwiches looked pretty good but I haven't tried them.
0,"Awful seafood. A small group of us stopped by for a quick bite of their oysters and scallops before heading to another hotel. Everything was incredibly salty and had a fishy after taste. It made us think they over-salted everything to mask the poor quality and freshness of the seafood. The waiters proceeded to say the saltiness was from the ocean, but c'mon salty to the point it made your face pucker??  They ended up comping us on the inedible items, which was nice... but definitely won't be coming back."
0,"Wow! What a disappointment for this once great place. Food was still acceptable but no football, just really loud, ear splitting music.  So loud the customers complaints must not have been heard because it just kept on cranking. The adjacent table left mad.....we left with a headache."
0,"This is not for Dr. Stevens, but for the center's billing policies and staff.\n\nI called to schedule an appointment for surgery but was told I needed another appointment before then. No problem, just schedule me for another appointment.\n\nNot so fast. You have a $22.00 outstanding balance on your account. No problem, can I pay it when I show for the next appointment? No, we're sorry, we cannot schedule you for an appointment with an outstanding balance EVEN after checking with our billing supervisor.\n\nReally? If I didn't like Dr. Stevens so much, I would have switched to another facility. \n\nIt's $22 people. Think customer service."
0,"Good riddance to this rubbish service and hotel.\n\nTried to book a reservation over the phone for my daughter, but all I got was either being put on hold or passed back and forth from front desk to reservations.\nI told reservations I am paying with my credit card and they insisted that my daughter must have my credit card to check in and then tell me that I should have booked 3 days in advance."
1,"I had my car washed at Clean Car Express in May. This place  is AWESOME - having a better and longer car wash garage then typical ones. My vehicle had been transported from California to Pennsylvania and covered by dust or stain that was hard to completely remove in a regular car wash store. But my car was cleaned within just one cycle in Clean Car Express! And the price is reasonable for the result at that time. Back in California (and basically anywhere else), it is difficult for me to find a car washing store with such impressive equipment and service. The exterior of the garage is also of a beautiful cartoon style. It definitely worths a try!"
0,"Purchased a living social deal.. What better way to find a new salon without spending a bunch of cash and possibly end up unhappy?  I was also curious about how organic hair color would work on my hair that has been abused with Redken for years.  I work in an industry where we survive on tips, so I get it, its annoying when someone uses a coupon...but it also brings in a new customer base.  I bought my living social deal for $69 today (7/21/2014) and called to make an appointment.  I was hoping for sometime next week and the chick on the phone goes \""uhhhh we don't have anything available for that until October 5th.\""  Coupon returned."
0,"I have been saving money to get married recently, but we got a gift card for OTB, Chilis, Macaroni Grill or someother place I haven't heard of (Italian).  We always go to Chili's so we decided to go here.  I have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay.  The chips were okay and the salsa was great.  It seemed fresh.  We got good service and the fiancee ordered a margarita which was tasty.  I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I do at a more authentic Mexican resaurant.  I ordered a chicken chimichanga and rice and beans and the refried beans have not been my favorite and nothing about the experience was bad there, but I just have no desire to go back any time soon.  The service was good, but this place was sort of blah.  If I lived back in Pennsylvania, it would be okay Mexican food, but out here in AZ it is nothing to go crazy for."
0,Really wanted them to do better in the new location. The built out of the restaurant is done quite well so we were looking forward to a nice dinner. The best thing to hit the table that night was unfortunately the bread. We ordered Spaghetti & Meatballs (bland).....Chicken Parm (driest Chicken ever and why do they put Ricotta on the Parm).....the other two dishes were so flavorless that I already forgot what they were....honestly the other hospitals provide better food.\nYou can tell they spent a lot of money to create a nice atmosphere if they had a cook to match this place could be very succesful despite the prices.
0,"Three chill dog and fries, with drinks comes out to fifty dollars. Fries were bland, the chill had no flavor. Regular bun and hot dog if was for the industrial era.  Service was petty slow. Drink were cheeper at the stalls next to Nathan's."
0,"Pizza was disgusting; not fresh and reminded me of Red Barron. \nMy order took exactly 1hr 47min to arrive; and was cold. When I called to complain; I was provided a $2 discount. The girl was rude; and acted as if it happens all the time; so it was simply no big deal. My order from this place was a mistake to begin with; as I thought I had ordered from my FAVORITE place, Sicilis. BIG MISTAKE!!! If you want GOOD and Authentic pizza; ORDER FROM SICILIS on Twain. Stay far, far away from this place."
1,"I've been here a few times with my mom, brother, and her husband. My family is full of skinny people but we go here bc my stepdad us a cheapskate. The variety is really good and there's fresh veggies. I never went to a buffet before coming to Phoenix so I guess this one is not so bad. \n\nThe thing is, there's a ton if huge, gigantic people who go here to load up. I find that disturbing. But I'm assuming they like to frequent buffets."
0,"Not impressed. The staff was standing around, the pizza by the slice was limited to two choices that looks to have been sitting for a while and wasn't very good.  And no one seemed to really care."
0,"I am so incredibly disappointed in the assistance I have received from Phoenix College. I am a first-time college student who also works full time. I enrolled in 3 classes to start easily. I have had an issue with one of my online classes for a MONTH now. Advisors have been unhelpful to say the least. They do nothing but tell me to contact the instructor, which I have tried to do several times to no avail. So I ask and advisor again, and they tell me to contact the instructor's department head. \n\nSure, that would be great, except the class begun YESTERDAY and I STILL have no gotten any answers or help regarding the issue. \n\nI would not recommend this college based on the experience I've had. I've spoken to many people who are currently enrolled in other schools, and they have been blown away by the general unavailability and apparent ambivalence of the advisors to help me with my issues."
1,"This was just one of the activities my party planned for our Bachelor Party matters and it was definitely on top of the list outside of the unmentionables. \n\nWe rented a party house off the strip and were picked up in large military painted truck. The truck was badass, but every time it caught some air we all thought it might be the end, like final destination style, due to having no seat belts. \n\nI didn't do any shooting, but I got to sit in and watch all the fellas take on the challenge. Some guys had stellar capabilities, other guys did not, the bachelor being one of the worse. It was very legit. The instructors were thorough with our safety and comprehensive with teaching us about the guns we used and much more. \n\nSecret tip: one of the employees said they have a package called shooting after dark where they bring strippers in bikinis in to shoot with you. If that's your type of thing, go for it."
0,"The best Thai we've eaten lately...is not here. Sushi was ok. We stopped here during happy hour so at least the price was decent. On the other hand, we overpaid for everything else so I guess it evened out in the end. The green papaya Salad was so excruciatingly hot it practically ruined our pallettes. The thai beef salad, which was 9 bucks, was the size of a side salad. It was dressed in that really sweet vinegar/sugar dressing and the beef was like leather. Overall, not a good experience.  For Thai from now on we'll just drive to Pam Real Thai on Decatur. The food there is absolutely incredible!"
0,"Dr. Adams is a wonderful doctor.  She is extremely caring, attentive and knowledgeable.  If this review were just for her adequacy as a physician, I would have given her 5 stars. Carly, Dr. Adams' admin, is also a joy to speak with.  She goes above and beyond her call of duty and will to try to help you in every way possible.  \n\nThe two main points that deserve a negative (yes, extremely subpar) rating are:\n\n1. The wait time.  I'm not sure how her staff books her patients; however, I have never had to wait any less than an hour for any of my SCHEDULED appointments.  I once had an appointment at 9:30 and did not get called back for my vitals until 11:40...absolutely ridiculous.\n\n2. Her nurse, Yolanda.  Let me preface this by saying that I am an RN.  I fully understand just how hectic and chaotic a busy physician's office can get at times.  Yolanda has an extremely poor attitude...I'm honestly shocked as to why she ever considered employment in the medical field.  Yolanda is rude, uncaring/unsympathetic and lazy.  I am on various medications, so I have to come into contact with this \""nurse\"" a great deal and every single time, she is extremely rude and uncaring.  It is to the point where as much as I love Dr. Adams, I am considering switching primary care physicians due to Yolanda.\n\nAs I stated earlier, if this review were just for Dr. Adams herself, I would give her a 5-star rating; however the wait time and her nurse Yolanda really bring her practice down."
0,"This place is horrible when it comes to...well everything! \n\nLONG story:\nI had gotten started with the SW Dental in Chandler but I had moved to Laveen. I did not have insurance and I thought they would be more affordable for me to get my wisdom teeth out, plus already having a file with SW dental. The LAVEEN office was very unprofessional over the phone when telling me they \""dont transfer files from other offices\"" and that I would be a new patient. (1st red flag). I asked if I should call the Chandler office and see if they would transfer per my request and the response was \""yeah yeah! do that!\"" (again, unprofessional).\n\nChandler office gave me NO grief on the transfer question and said they would send it over. I call Laveen, they said they got it.\n\n A WEEK later I went in for my visit to schedule the actual wisdom removal, and upon my arrival they told me to fill out the New Patient forms because they have not received my file from Chandler (why did both parties tell me it was sent & received??)\n\nWhen being sent back for Xrays (that have already been taken by the Chandler office), the tech must have been right out of school. She was all over the place and didn't know much about working the Pano xray machine. Pushing different buttons to see which did what, she was a finger-push away from clicking the button without my xray jacket. She comes back around the corner saying \""oh my gosh I always forget this, here put this on\"". Uh 2nd red flag! (luckily i didnt have to pay for them since they were \""waiting\"" on my file from the other location)\n\nUpon probing all over my mouth and reviewing the xrays with nurse, I mentioned I have high dentist anxiety and would like to have my boyfriend present for the day i have my wisdoms removal. They seemed real unsure about how to handle my request.\n\nI go into the clinic for the dreaded surgery day and I asked if my boyfriend can come back with me just until I was out. The response was NO because there would be too many wires and the room is not big enough. I took a lot of deep breaths and went back alone with the same dumb xray nurse i had previously. \n\nI sit in the chair and i am constantly fidgeting nervously and fighting back what i call \""nervousness tears\"". (I'm a big baby when it comes to the dentist). The doc comes in and was not of much comfort, just wanted to get it done and over with. No small talk, just dentist talk. They messed up the 1st time with the injection and had to try a couple more times before actually getting it right. Now i'm REAL nervous and I let the tears fall. The nurse then goes \""why you crying we havent even started yet\"". UH HELLO HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MY ANXIETY TO YOU GUYS!!!?????\n\nThen I was out. \n\n\nOh by the way, No i did not get a followup phone call from the doc or nurse seeing how my post-surgery was going. \n\nAnd not to mention the ridiculous pricing for it all even with \""their\"" insurance. It cost more than my boyfriends wisdom removal he had done at the Chandler office. \n\nVERY DISPLEASED and HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! \n\nHow are they still in business!?"
1,"I have been coming here since I started teaching down the road 5 years ago.  My friend suggested we get a mani/pedi and this place ended up being GREAT!  The staff is very friendly and professional.  They are very up to date with all the new nail services such as gel, shellac, and metallic.  The atmosphere isn't the best (not new), but its still nice.  The prices are amazing and they give the best leg/arm massages ever!!  I come to this place almost every month and have always left very happy!  :-)"

1,The Perch is a nice place to grab a drink and a bite to eat. It has a casual yet upbeat atmosphere. The menu is simple however the food and service are very good!
0,"Going to TCD was the longest, most miserable, painful experience in my life. I went to replace a bridge and 3 crowns. Trobough left me in painful, ill-fitting temporaries for around 4 months, resulting in an incisor that went necrotic and then needed a root canal.\n\nHe also performed another root canal without informed consent and without adequately protecting the remains of the tooth. I lost 30 lbs and couldn't eat solid food for months. The teeth he finally created had gaps between the gums and the edge of the teeth and were too long resulting in all my front teeth becoming so loose that I almost lost all of them. They would actually move over 2mm with a gentle push.\n\nHe saw this and did nothing for months, even with my teeth becoming necrotic and the continuous infections. He seemed happy to just keep doing root canals. To this day I still can't bite properly.\n\nHe also allowed his dental assistants to cement crowns and bridges in without supervision and without checking for proper bite afterwards which also constitutes dental malpractice and is against Nevada law.\n\nWhat can I say about Trobough? In my opinion and from my experience he is an incompetent, greedy, miserable human being.\n\nIn almost two years he still hasn't handed over my med file after being required to do so by law and after being legally served with a demand.  I have also filed a complaint with the Dental Board of Examiners to obtain that file.\n\nAll he could say was, \""Sorry I couldn't make you happy\"". Never apologized once for the damage, infections and weeks of lost work his malpractice caused."
1,"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a \""GOOD\"" Pizza. After eating lots of tasteless and cardboard pizza, I found Momma Mia when I moved into Arcadia! I love the hole in the wall vibe! Just like home :) The sauce is great and super tasty! The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads. I want to try their Philly Steak next, but for the time being I still make mine at home. \nEvery pizza place likes to say its \""New York Style\"", but this place really does a NYC pizza. Well the best nyc pizza you're gonna get in AZ, Something about the water."
1,"Starbucks basically has 2 types of stores: one for loiterers and one for commuters.  Loitering Starbucks have spacious dining areas, but no driv-thru.  This is definitely a 'commuter' Starbucks; smallish interior but with a drive-thru.\n\nNow, I'm a fan a Starbucks much like I am any other coffeehouse.  My caffeine tooth (or perhaps nerve ending) doesn't discriminate.  This particular Starbucks is probably not the best place to set up a laptop (no reading nooks, just a hallway really), but it is somewhere to get a quick cup of java.  The staff are really funny and talkative if you give them a chance.  I had this barista chat me up about how she wouldn't watch New Moon but she loved the soundtrack.  And she wasn't even taking my order!  The cashier had plenty of pep as well.  I guess then that it begs to reason that you should go inside and talk to the baristas...you be the judge."
0,Would have loved to try the food and wine but not one person came our way to take our order for 15 minutes after being seated. Was disappointed so we just left.
1,"I heart this place for Bfast.  Pho Kim long is perfect for late night munchies BC they never close.   \n\nThere was only few other customers dinning early am. My order rare beef with a order of added meat balls arrived asap. The the fresh mints, sprouts and jalapeno made my pho yummy on a cold morning.\n\nAnother plus is they take credit cards with no minimum so I'll  certainly return here for bfast for the convenience."
1,Love coming here to play frisbee golf with friends.  Very close to the University area is a plus.  This is a great park for all ages.
1,"I've been to Papaya Thai many times, but never remembered to write a review.  The food here is always worth the prices ($8-13 for basic entrees), but the service always seems lacking. \n\nEach time I've been there, it was during off-peak hours (later in the evening, or early in the afternoon), and it was usually just my table and no more than 1 or 2 others.  There always seems to be at least 3-4 servers walking around the front of the restaurant, but each time we were seated it took quite awhile before our drink orders were taken.  This wouldn't be quite so bad if the staff didn't tend to walk around in front of us, looking puzzled as to what they were supposed to do with us now that we had a table. \n\nOn different visits I have ordered:  the egg roll appetizers, the crab roll appetizers, spring rolls, and the green curry.  My friends always order one of the other curries, so I've tried all of them.  They are all terrific, but my favorite is the green curry.  All of the appetizers I've had were also wonderful.  All servings have been generous, and the curries are all flavorful, and creamy, and when I order a curry dish, I never fail to fill up at the restaurant and still have enough to take home for 2 more meals.  Nice!\n\nAs for the service, the last time I went there, I was joined by two friends. I ordered the spring rolls, and they shared a big bowl of one of the soups.  When our entrees came out, the server handed us our plates, but neglected to take away our empty appetizer/soup plates.  I even mentioned to him that we were done and they could be taken away.  Finally, I stacked them up myself, got his attention again, and asked him could he please do something with these since there's no room on the table for our entrees??  He apologized profusely, and got it cleared up.  But, since when should you have ask for servers to remove plates??\n\nI ordered for delivery from there since then.  I ordered green curry with pork, and spring rolls.  The food was delivered in a timely manner, but they sent put chicken in the curry instead of pork.  I've also ordered for take-out from there a few times  and never had a problem.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, on my 3rd visit in there, it had been about 6 weeks since my previous visit, and the nice, sweet server lady there remembered my order exactly.  WOW!  Unbelievable!  It's such a nice touch when you're remembered.  \n\nOverall:  Don't go there looking for stellar service.  The staff is perfectly polite, never rude, but for the most part, just not on the ball.  \n\nReasons to go:  Great prices, and great generous helpings of food."
1,"If you have a group, get the suite. It has 2 queen beds, a walk in shower, a bath tub, a separate toilet (closed door), 2 sinks, a roll out bed (fits 2) and another side couch so 7 people can sleep comfortably.\n\nFor $300 a night split between 7 people, pretty good deal."
1,"Food is excellent! Definitely give it a try here. Yes, the other Indian places around this area are not that great. However, when I went to this place, the service was very slow. There were not that many people inside. It was my family (3) and 3 other families inside.\n\nAlso, the price is quite high for the portion size. And I can't believe rice and the bread are extra! You know how restaurants have a side of bread or rice with meals? This one didn't so it was disappointing. Luckily, the flavor of their food was excellent. Hence the 4 stars."
1,"Smoothie that is disappearing too fast (it's soooo good and refreshing). Wonderful products for Quebec food producers. Nice pastries and coffee on the go.\n\nTheir place is also the pick-up place for some fruits and veggies baskets from a farm on the south shore (les Jardins du petit Tremble), and they have another program where, on a monthly basis, you receive a sampling of local products for a small fee."
0,this is now a mexican bar w/ a hot dog cart out front on the weekends. Marinos De Camillo or something like that. Very small parking lot but the only bar in the neighborhood
0,Bad service and rude employee. She made mistakes with our order and made us feel unwelcome. Like it was an inconvenience to fix the order and refund the overage. Anyone have a good falafel place for the north valley?
1,"Just saw my girl Arliss and I now have a fabulous moms-night-out worthy blowout.  The back of my head has never looked better!  Arliss gave me a spa-like shampoo with my choice of essential oil in the conditioner.  I chose spearmint.  So refreshing!  The blow out that followed was so relaxing I almost fell asleep in the chair.\n\nI followed Arliss from another salon because she seems to know intuitively what I want and she takes the time to get my hair just right.  I don't walk out until she's satisfied.  I'm lazy about my hair, so I need that stylist help.\n\nThe ambience at Blowout Dollhouse is cheerful and girly.  Love it.  And now I've discovered the second floor at Tivoli Village.  I'm looking forward to coming back and checking out some of the other shops.  See you next week!"
1,"Fossil has moved outside of the old building and is now situated in one of the new street front outlets. \n\nWhen they have sales it can be ridiculous. My sister dragged me her because she found a purse that she absolutely loved and was pushing for it to be a birthday gift. I came with intending to buy it for her and leaving right away. Instead I was rummaging through the sales and clearance items. \n\nThe staff are quick to approach patrons and offer any assistance. This threw me for a loop because within a fifteen foot stretch I was greeted by four different sales associates. When I went to the register, I was asked if someone helped me find my items and I was so overwhelmed that I said no. That might have been a bad move because she looked miffed afterwards. I should have said ALL of them because it would not have been a lie."
1,"Seven of us met for breakfast today, and I didn't hear one complaint from my party.  We showed up at 9:30 and were seated within 5 minutes.  I was a little hesitant, reading the negative reviews for this place, but left pleasantly surprised.\n\nI'm not sure if they changed out their biscuits (based on previous reviews), but my friend who ordered them, complimented their biscuits and gravy.  I ordered the huevos rancheros with green chile, and loved it.  The dish came with rice, beans and hash browns.\n\nGood job RHG!"
0,"Spoke to owner and they are not open to the public anymore. Info on website and Yelp, etc. not up to date. Not sure why they have a storefront that says they are open 11-6."
0,"First let me start off by saying I am a huge Cirque fan.  Seen at least 10 shows.  So please read this if you are considering seeing this show.  This is BY FAR the WORST show.  It is so juvenile.  I can't think of any other word.  I thought the acting was silly. I was actually embarassed for some of the people in the show.  There was no real talent in comparison to other Cirque shows.  I have been wanting to see this show for 2 years now. And was soooo excited to take my BF to his 1st Cirque show.  It was A COMPLETE LET DOWN.  Honestly, the only thing good about it was how the stage moves up and down and all around.  That was neat.  If you want to see a great Cirque show see O.  If you still want to see this then pay the cheapest you can so you won't feel like you just got ripped off.  No matter where you sit, it's pretty much the same.  Don't believe the reviews that say you have to get great seats.  I did and regret spending that much money.  I agree with the guy who said this should be called Ka Ka.  A few people around us fell asleep.  And what was with stupid over-sized stuffed animals?!?  LAME.  Oh well, live and learn."
1,"My husband and I are heading back to this place in a few weeks.  We love it here. We stayed here for the first time last month and got a wonderful upgrade to a spa-room.  It was great.  The bar in the middle of the casino is fun (the late night drunks are so much fun to watch).  The service there by most was just wonderful.  The only reason it didn't get 5 starts is because we had a blackjack dealer we thought had swine flu and kept flipping over the cards and was horrible!!  Also, we didn't win a thing here. But he did have fun at the poker games at the bar."
1,"It Gets a 4 Star Because I liked RAVE Better with Cocktail servers.  When AMC took over that disappeared.  Place is clean and Town Square Location is really Nice with Great food nearby.  I like to sneak in Fod cuz its still to pricey, the Frozen Yogurt Place downstairs is awesome, get a Top and Sneak it in, inside your girls Purse! Bring Socks to keep your feet Warm."
0,"The good news: You can save $10 per ticket by pre-purchasing online.\n\nThe bad news: You will wait one hour for each ride.\n\nI took my adult sons here for a day of birthday fun and we were so terribly disappointed. The ride lines were long and so slooooow. Everyone was complaining. I just can't understand how Disney can get this right but no one else seems to be able to. PEOPLE AT WET & WILD: hire an efficiency expert to fix this problem. \n\nOh yeah, and you need more of those 4-people rafts. Half the waiting was because you didn't have enough of them.\n\nWhen families spend this kind of money to go to the water park, they want to have fun. Not wait. Yes, there is a fast-pass you can buy for ANOTHER $20, but I saw those people waiting, too.\n\nAnother nit...a bottle of water is $3.99. And a double scoop of Thrifty (ha) ice cream cost me $5.00.\n\nReally, truly disappointing. I won't be back."
1,"We've been by this place a number of times since we live right by it and we finally decided to try it.  The family was starving and I was in the mood to try something new.  I ordered some chicken and beef tacos, chicken and beef tostadas, a cheese quesadilla, some chips/salsa, and flan to go.  It didn't take too long for the order.  It was probably in the 5-10 minute range.  \n\nI took it all home and placed it on the table for everyone to dig in.  We pulled out the tacos and tostadas.  The meat was great!  Everyone agreed that the tacos were better than the tostadas.  The tostadas seemed to be a little on the crispy side.  The kids tore through the quesadilla so I'm assuming it was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were very good.  \n\nThey also give you a salsa bar to select different kinds of salsa which is very nice.  We sampled the different salsas and found them all to be very tasty.  \n\nWe all finished and it was time for dessert...the flan.  Wait, all the bags were open...where was the flan???  Well $&%@!!!!  They didn't give us the flan but they were nice enough to charge us for it.  I have to admit it was one of the pictures I saw here on yelp and it looked so good.  I was really looking forward to trying it.  I thought about going back and the kids wanted me to go back but it was late on a Monday night and I just wasn't feeling like going to argue for flan.  \n\nI've been debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4.  I really liked the meat but I'm really pissed about the flan.  I finally decided to go ahead and give it a 4.  I did like the flavor of the meat and I will probably return for more tacos.  If you get takeout I would highly suggest giving your bag a couple of extra checks to make sure you aren't missing any items or you risk getting home and being disappointed."
0,"Wow, was I disappointed.  I saw them at the NJ Performing Arts Center and was in the 2nd of 5 balconies.  Many of their acts are not balcony friendly as we were simply too far away.  Perhaps 25% were entertaining, but at times I was struggling to stay awake.  It was definitely not worth the money... $225!  Sunday on the coach watching a game would have been much more enjoyable.  In short, I thought their show was dated and weak."
1,"I've been to this bar on several occasions, a couple times for happy hour and a couple times paying retail.  I seem to be hooked on their nacho mama's chips because every so often I get a strong craving for them.  They're different from the typical chip, its somehow puffed up.  The salsa that comes with it is a good accompaniment and I always end up going through at least 1 refill of it.  I usually don't like the cheese melted on top method that solidifies halfway through (versus the nacho cheese sauce), but it goes well with the chips.  I think if you have 3-4 people and you share its perfect, portion wise and cheese wise.\n\nThe sliders are ok, pretty typical.  Kinda dry, I like to cover mine with ketchup.  The crapcakes are good, but pretty small.  I keep meaning to try some of the dinner items on the menu.  The beer is kinda pricey retail - it was $5 for draft hefeweisens when i went last night.  It wasn't happy hour but geez.."
0,"Well I was thinking to myself last night that I would be giving this location a 3. \n\nHOWEVER, that just went down the drain. Last night the hubs and I ate dinner here. I am currently on this strict vegan diet, so I asked the waiter if the black bean burger was vegan. He said he wasn't sure but that he would check. A minute later he comes back and says yes it is. SCORE! I eat half of it and boxed up the rest for lunch, which I will no longer be able to eat BECAUSE THE DAMN BURGER IS NOT VEGAN! I went on PJ's website this morning to find out calories and what not, because I track that stuff, they had a whole section listing what is vegan and what is not,and sure as shit, the black bean burger was listed on their site as NOT being vegan...why the staff doesn't have access to this info I do not know. \n\nSo anyway.....Our actual experience was ok. This time around all the employees were actually dressed and no goods were hanging out. Our waiter sucked. He never checked on us once the food came, never came to give us refills, our plates were cleared away by someone else, a box was brought to me by someone else, we had our credit card sitting on the table for a good ten minutes waiting for the bill. They did get a wee bit busy, but they seriously had about 6 people working that night for that very small location. \n\nI'm not sure what is up with this location. It has always been like pulling teeth to get decent service there. The food is always good but the service is lacking."
0,"Delux is very over-rated and over-priced. The burgers were not \""top quality\"" as the Phoenix Magazine recently illustrated. Despite the friendly wait staff, I would not recommend."
1,"Have been here twice and both times I really liked the meal.  Tried to come here on a Saturday night and the line was way out the door.  \n\nSlightly out of the way place for a tourist, but way better experience that in downtown.  The area around it looks like it would be fun to explore in the Summer too!"
0,"Like most others who have reviewed this place I went because of my Groupon. I will not be returning except to maybe check out the clothes.\n\nThe facial originally cost about $80 but only lasted 30 minutes. It was like getting my face washed with a little shoulder massage. \n\nThe mani and pedi were the worst I've ever had. The pedi stations are super uncomfortable, its just a long bench (hard to reach the sink, no massage). The manicure consisted of filing and painting my nails, NOTHING more. The mani peeled off the next day and the pedi in about 5.\n\nThe blowout was pretty average, nothing different than what i could have done. \n\nI felt obligated to tip on the full prices (which is always the rule with a Groupon) but i was not happy about it!"
1,Fire house sub is great! very close to the house and delicious subs! if you are looking for something similar to subway with a wider variety of flavor profiles I would recommend trying Fire house! its great! their take on the philly is amazing and the huge assortment of hot sauces provide great tastes for any sandwich selection!
0,"While I enjoy a few other Wolfgang Puck restaurants this one is just terrible.\nThey messed up our order on more then one occasion.\n\nI ordered the \""Pink Lady Apple Salad, Arugula, Fennel, Medjool Dates, Shropshire Blue Cheese, Aged Sherry Vinaigrette \"" for the start. I specifically asked if they could exchange the Arugula for a crisper green such as Romaine or Butter Lettuce and they assured me it would be no problem. Well, my salad came and it had Arugula. I brought it to the waiters attention and he did say they messed up and would re-make it right except by the time the new salad came so did my steak.  It would turn out that I had time to eat the newer salad because the \""Rib Eye Steak\"" I ordered well done came out rare.\nI just didn't enjoy my meal or the service. For what you pay in this restaurant you would expect that what you order would come out right.\nWell, for the both of our meals it came out to $120 before tip.\nI recommend not wasting your money here."
0,"This was my first and will be my last visit to Wagamamas!  When we arrived only 2 other tables were occupied.  We were seated but then had to go in search of a waiter/waitress after sitting for 20minutes and no order taken. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because of the starters (lollipop prawns and calamari).  These were very overpriced for what they were but tasty and edible unlike the main course.  We both had noodle dishes one was a ramen and I can't remember what the other one was other than disgusting.  Both looked like a whole coriander plant had fallen in by accident.  I could still taste lumps of the stock cube used in mine.  His smelled like used football socks had been added to make the stock.  Upon complaining to the waitress (who we again had to search for) we were told we could have one starter on the house.  The damage at the end came to nearly \u00a350 even with this free starter.  Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else, anywhere else!  There are plenty of reasonably priced decent places in Edinburgh don't waste your time here."
1,"The guys here are top notch, period. All the artists are very talented and professional. The shop is clean and hygienic. Buddy did some work for us and we found him to be very collaborative and he did a great job. We'll be back for sure!"
1,"If you've never done Bikram Yoga before, this is a great place to start.  Not only are all the instructors extremely competent and inspiring, but there is a very friendly atmosphere here.  If you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to do Bikram, this is the place to go.  The room is large, well-lit, and has high ceilings with comfortable carpet and many mirrors.  There is free filtered water, and plenty of space and showers in the locker rooms.  Overall, a great place to practice yoga.  To borrow a phrase, at Bikram PV, all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average!"
1,"The entire staff are awesome! I think I know almost every single persons name that work there and vice versa.  \n\nI'll admit a few years ago I had a fall out due to an issue with a manager at this location.  But I'm glad that a year after that I happen to come in for a business emergency and found out that she no longer works there... So now I'm glad to say that I am back as a loyal, happy customer.  \n\nThey recently remodeled the place- so it looks more organized and updated.  They have bilingual staff - Japanese and Spanish people that can help you out with anything :P. This location gets high traffic due to all the businesses in their close proximity.  But definitely their professionalism and friendliness overrides waiting in line for a few minutes !!"
0,"It's a meh kinda airport. It's older and large for no reason. Takes forever to get your bags, at least from American Airlines. Waiting for a bag at the airport is the OPPOSITE of what you want when you're ready to hit the strip.\n\nAlso when I just checked, there were no Uber cars available. WTF?! I had never seen this on my Uber screen. I thought it was a mistake. Usually iUber shows at least one car maybe 6-15 minutes away. Absolutely nothing. Maybe this airport doesn't allow Uber... I'm not up on the latest Las Vegas news."
0,"We went back to Outback last night thanks to a $10 \""gift\"" card and had hoped things had changed for the better but had not. I could drop my rating back half a star but my wife actually enjoyed her meal.\n\nThe reasoning behind dropping at least 1/2 a star is that Outback has deemed it necessary to skimp on their portions in order to make the plates more artsy-fartsy or more \""presentable\"", for those of you who drink with your pinky in the air.\n\nBlooming onion was a bit overcooked and the coating was falling off the onions. (Onions were STRONG, Altoids\u00ae are a must this morning!). Caesar salad's dressing was very strong, too. Mixed drinks were on the small side. I could've sworn the glasses were bigger before.\n\nChicken and ribs: I got a very tiny grilled chicken breast that was a bit on the dry side. The side of ribs were 1/3 the size of their normal full slab and they were the best part of the meal. Side of mashed potatoes were too garlicky and portions tiny.\nMy better-half had the sweet potato fries that were just \""okay\"".\n\nOur server, Noah, was great. Fast, efficient, and friendly. I could almost bump up my rating to another star because of him.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
1,Bobby Q was excellent for Father's Day lunch. Service was excellent and the food was the best BBQ ever! This is the best BBQ in Arizona! Yummm
1,I met a friend here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend the Matador.  Things I would never have thought of to combine but it was absolutely delicious.  They also have a great bloody mary bar for only $5.  I would highly highly recommend this place. You can sit indoors or out.  They have misters so even in the heat it didn't feel that bad.  The servers were attentive but not in your face so we were able to sit and talk without feeling like we were being pushed out.  \n\nParking is difficult but they do have a free valet.
0,Took my daughter here on Saturday with me for a daughter / mom day an by Monday our nails are chipping an cracked.. I had to have the polished removed because they looked so bad. I felt we were very over charged..  well worth going somewhere else..  I never get my nails done an this is Why.. Definitely may be contacting my bank to see what I can do..  not worth $80 bucks...gave two stars because my daughter had a good day.
1,Paneer is sooooo good here!!!
1,"I'm pretty sure this place is open 24 hours? We came at 2am and the place was about half full. Honestly, take all the reviews with a grain of salt... When I wanted to go to Ike's in SF, my friend told me not to because \""how can a sandwich be THAT good?!\"" \""Maybe because I LOVE sandwiches???\"" I thought, but in hindsight, really... how CAN a sandwich be that good??? Didn't like how there was no choice for bread, and you have to get white, but it was still nice and toasted =) The Hawaiian BBQ chicken would be my recommendation but from what I've heard, you can't go wrong ;)"
1,Yum!\n\n1 star = customer service was awesome.  They really helped me out as it was my very first time really eating Indian food.  My friend is also on a Vegan diet and they helped him pick the foods he can eat.  Extremely helpful!\n\n2 stars = for the environment!  Handcrafted art and tapestry walls surround you in the restaurant and it feels kind of intimate and romantic!\n\n3 stars = GARLIC NAAN.  Don't leave this place w/ out trying it especially if you're into bread and garlic like I am.  It is so tasty I finished the entire basket myself!\n\n4 stars = Chicken Tikka Masala!  Yum! Buttery curry and mildly spicy over a bed of their rice; so good!  \n\n5 stars = Fried Okra!  My friend ordered spicy so it was a lot to handle but the veggies went really well to compliment my Chicken.\n\nComing back for sure!
1,"it was the best out of caesars palace and rio. caesars didn't have much variety but the environment was nice. rio had better variety but the environment was like a denny's.\n\nhere, there was quite of variety as well as a beautiful environment. it was decorated like the streets of paris (similar to the outside building). \n\nTHE CREPES AND CREME BRULEE WAS DEFINITELY A MUST TRY!!!!   their desserts were definitely better than rio's and caesars.  at the paris buffet, there was a salad bar and fresh to be made omelettes.  there were also more fresh fruits and dessert variety compared to the other 2 buffets.\n\ni would definitely go again!"
0,"This was my first time to Vegas and my first time at this hotel and it was a bad experience. This hotel is on the opposite side of \""fun\"", it's in the \""ghetto\"" area! Right when we walked into the hotel they try to get you to sign up for this 2.5 hour tour to take you and show you their other hotels that they just opened - which sure they offer you a free stay at any of their resorts for doing this tour but seriously who wants to be bribed right when they walk in? We did put our names down with a $20 refundable deposit just in case we did want to do this, but in the end we wanted a refund - which took them 30 minutes to even find our name on their list and we had to come back 2 hours later to get our $20 back and they STILL tried to sell us ANOTHER deal - VERY disorganized and annoying! We were able to check in 4 hours before our check in time, which was very nice and for a VERY reasonable price, but we had to ask the front desk ourselves -  NO ONE told us we were able to do that, everyone acted like that wasn't even possible. The room was OK, I've gotten cheaper hotels that at least had a microwave and fridge in it. Unfortunately, within the first 30 minutes of settling into our room my fiance and I were trying to rest and a lady seriously knocked on our door TWICE and RIGHT AFTER she walked in!!! The pool was nice, but the Jacuzzi was dirty. I was not able to check out the rides- the lines for the ride were super long!If anything good came out of this experience it was the floor with the food and shopping area, it was pretty nice- the Mexican food place was on point; VERY fresh and yummy with a for sure reasonable price! I would NOT come back here again."
1,"Our server (David was his name) was fantastic. He was enthusiastic and friendly, tried to upsell (offered drinks vs. asking what we wanted, offered cheese on our eggs, etc.) and took the time to show us the changes to the new menu. Very helpful and cheery..honestly not what I would typically expect from a breakfast restaurant (usually the servers seem stressed and rushed). Food was good, as usual..but his service would have brought us back regardless!"
0,"This used to be a hidden gem at the Plaza on the end of Fremont Street.  Has turned into a train wreck.  What once was a bustling restaurant, with capable wait staff, has turned into something that is beyond description.  No longer do waitresses serve you but you must go up to the counter and order.  Gone are the waitresses and experienced sushi chefs, gone are the specialty fish that used to be for sale.  Glass cases are empty, non-asian sushi chefs are behind the sushi bar, and it was deserted.  I hope the new management is happy.  We used to go AT LEAST once a month, and always took our visitors there - but no longer.  Our group of 5 walked in on July 5th, saw the changes and left.  Congrats to the management for taking a wonderful place and killing it."
0,"this club is only full because marquee is too hard to get into...\n\nwe decided to check out this place because some promoter talked us into going... hmm... shoulda known... but at least he was nice?\n\n1 star for:\n- mean hostess... if you hate your job, why are you there? plus, your club is like second tier, so you should be nice to us girls who are coming in... cuz you need us to bring the boys...\n\n- drinks are extra expensive... $60 dollar for 4 small shots; $8 for a bottle of water... i guess it's justified if the scene deserves it... but it doesnt...\n\n- the place is relatively small... and no where to sit unless you have a table\n\nspend your money elsewhere"
0,"I really wanted to like this place, but they've let me down too many times. We live right down the street and were excited for a close  seemingly cool restaurant. The food is good and they have a good reverse happy hour...when it's actually available. The past 5 times we have gone on the weekend, they have either been closed or turned us away because they are completely out of food by 9pm ( when the advertised reverse happy hour starts). The excuse is always \"" we are out of food because we make everything from scratch and our food is fresh\""... From my understanding,  most good successful restaurants do that, I don't think that's a very good excuse to always be out of food, especially if you're business is serving food. I don't know how they are still in business but I'm definitely not going back because it's a waste of my time to go there just to be turned away because they aren't serving food. Supply and demand."
0,"Warning, Do Not Buy Groupon...Spent $25.00 for six \""elite\"" car washes at Full Circle Car Wash.  The first one,  the car was cleaned inside and out.  But wash 2-6, was exterior water only,  no wiping.  I can go down the street and run my car through a wash and get wet and wiped down for less...A giant rip off!!!  I have gone \""full circle\"", alright!!!  Never again will I go to that misleading, ELITE car wash or use Groupon...(Hey Groupon check the quality of what you sell...)"
0,"thanks a lot cousin....\n\ntried this place cause cousin said it was good..like REALLY good and they had a segement on a food show (forgot which one)\n\nplace is in a plaza and the restaurant is pretty cute, had all these lil notes on the wall\n\nOrdered tripe and steak pho and the soup is pretty good...NOT super bomb but it was definitely good for the moment since i havent had an asian meal for couple of days...the beef was a lil tough? tripe was good....the portion was a lil smaller than im used to, i had to eat some from the large bowl's order....\n\nThis is the part that got me and makes me never wanna come back....there was a SMALL ass cockroach in one of the orders....and it wasnt there on top waiting to get noticed! it was drowned IN the noodle for quite some time....and i was eating from that bowl...i almost gagged!  Hey, im from chinatown and i know im used to seeing that but still!\n\nso we told the hostess/owner/whoever she was, and she looked like WOW...and she didnt apologized! she just looked at it and was like no and took our chopsticks to the kitchen....comes back! and said she doesnt know how it got there and that they were cleaned....\n\nlady, its fine....shit happens ok...but damn....dont give me this whole speech about its not impossible and blah blah....its ok! but the fact is i asked her if she could just comp the order or something, she didnt seem like she wanted to budge and she offers us $5 off....\n\nno offense,....$5 off? lady...there was a cockroach in the bowl for quite some time and you think $5 will suffice?! i seen better deals from 5 stars restaurant...and i know this restaurant has a reputation to uphold since it was on tv...\n\nnever again..."
0,"I've been at the parlor several times. Slightly odd decor and nice exterior. Food is a mixed bag for me. Pizzas are ok, sandwiches oddly filled and come on a strange bread that has to be perfectly fresh or the sandwich is ruined - and that happened a couple of times. So far the brie burger is my favorite. It is super greazy but goes down pretty well. The fries that come with it are VERY nice but I don't bother with the salad because it tends to be very tart and otherwise flavorless. Most of the salads don't appeal to me, but I usually do enjoy salads in other places. Service is moderate and has improved. Used be quite bad. \n\nThe bar stools are a turn-off for me; barber chairs... yuk. This place used to be a hair salon and they kept some of the hair styling furniture and decor. I don't like to associate my meals with hair clippings but the thought is forced into my head. Please, what are they thinking in that place. \n\nI'm usually there with a group. Not my first choice but if someone in the group wants to go then I don't fight it too much; it's not horrible.\n\nUpdate:  So I ended up in this place again, and my experience is not much different this time either. This time I am beginning to notice that the pizza crusts are always burned or the have a large spot or two that is black.  Today, three of us had pizzas and every one of them has a nearly black rim. Is it just me?? I like to eat the crust edges, but don't like when they are burned that way."
0,"I been to alot of retail locations and these are up their with terrible service high prices.\n\nI have gone there multiple occasions and it has been the same all the time. First time I went in there was to purchase a new R11. No service people around to help or they were to busy talking to one another. I left and went to another golf shop for purchase. \n\nI came in with my wife to look for a set of golf clubs for her. We walked around and had a few questions. Couldn't find any one around. I then approached 3 gentlemen at the training area, they did not acknowledge me for 3 minutes as I stood directly in front of the as they discussed their private lives. Finally I spoke up and asked for assistance, How sad that if im in front of you staring that I have to ask...\n\nAfter they answered my question they pointed over to where the box sets were and that was it. \n\nMy wife agreed that was terrible service!\n\nWe went over to the box sets and had more questions, but again had to chase a man who was quickly moving away as he saw us stare in his direction. \n\nAfter approaching him he gave a blank look and I just said never mind and left. \n\nI have finally decided after the many times that the prices are terrible and the service is terrible. I will shop elsewhere and I recommend you do to."
0,"The food here was amazing, and the portions where huge, but service is another story. We showed up to the restaurant with a party of 12, we had made a reservation several weeks ago for this party size. We showed up at 7:30, ordered our appetizers, and drinks. We got our appetizers pretty quickly, but it took a while for our drinks. Then they took out dinner orders at 8:30, yes, a whole later. Then our food didn't show up to the table until 9:10, seriously 9:10pm. The forgot to add two of the people in our parties food to the order, so they didn't get their food until 9:35. They literally had to watch other people eat in front of them. When we tried to confront management, they just said \""sorry, but the kitchen has been busy all night.\"" Then in one final attempt to make up for the poor service, the try to bring us a giant spool of cotton candy that no one asked for. This is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had (and I've eaten at Sizzler). I will never be back to this place again, and our party was looking for a regular place to come eat when were in town for the Cardinal games. Our bill was close to $600 last night, imagine the gratuity that your servers are missing out on."
1,"I've always dreamed of going to Paris for all the perks and sight-seeing one can do in such a foreign place. Unfortunately, I've heard that the French aren't too fond of ANYTHING American :( Is that true? Because I like the French. Most especially the food! I haven't been able to go to Paris yet, but the Paris Hotel may be the closest I will get to being there for a while, so, I shall enjoy what I have at the moment.\n\nThe very first time I went here was with my girlfriend on date. Often times we like to tour the city as if we've never been here and well, Mon Ami Gabi was already her favorite and she introduced this elegant place on the Las Vegas strip. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations as this place tends to become very busy and crowded. If you're lucky enough, request for the patio and it places you right across the street from the Bellagio fountains. It is a spectacular feat when you're with that special person enjoying a lovely dinner! :)\n\nAs soon as your server greets, you'll be asked for your choice of drink. I'm a water person so, I'll always get water. For you wine and champagne drinkers, ask your server what they would recommend with your meal. The servers are pretty knowledgable of the perfect dinner match. They'll serve with French bread and a carrot salad or slaw. It doesn't come with very much flavor so if you're worried about ruining your palette for what's to come, you needn't worry.  We usually order the steamed mussels in a leek cream.  It changed recently so it isn't as great as it used to be.  The whole serving size isn't the same size as what it used to be, so you won't get as much as before, but still a tasty appetizer.\n\nAnd now for the main course.......\nFilet with red wine reduction and merlot butter cooked to medium :9\""\""\"" yum! This is my girlfriend's favorite steak for 1) The flavor of the reduction with the merlot butter, 2) the merlot butter, 3) The way the steak is cooked to perfection so that it melts in your mouth! Mmm... The filet is also served with frites (french fries). I have tried the different steaks like the Steak Roquefort (bleu cheese sauce) and the Steak Bordelaise (red wine). It depends on the flavor you're craving but regardless of which steak you're ordering, your choice will always be a tasty one. I've returned numerous times to enjoy the service, the atmosphere, and most of all the food. I'm already looking forward to the next time while typing this review. So I would definitely return! Enjoy and happy eating!"
1,"Food was ok -  not fabulous, but hey it's bar food. The restaurant was rather empty so service was exceptional. What bumped them up to 4 stars is the fact that they now are on Restaurant.com.\n\nThis morning, we wanted to take our 3 starving teenaged boys out for breakfast, which would normally cost about 50-75 bucks (they'll each eat a big platter of food, then get pancakes or french toast for sides)! \n\nWe pulled up restaurant.com, and Putters came up as a new restaurant. We ordered a $25 gift certificate and used a code to get 80% off. The certificate cost $2, and breakfast ended up totaling us $22 after the coupon. But man all the food those boys consumed was worth it. \n\nThe boys all ordered chicken fried steak and it was a large portion, crispy and flavorful. I had a skillet with made to order eggs, home fries, peppers, onions, cheese, and bacon or sausage. It was exellent. \n\nWe were very surprised at how delicious the food ended up tasting. We hope they end up remaining on restaurant.com, as we'll quickly become regulars."
1,"I always enjoy Town Square. It is close to both home and work for me! There are plenty of stores to stop in and shop and find whatever it is you may need or even to find what you didn't even know you needed/wanted! There are plenty of dining options (some better than others), a movie theater, an outdoor hang out area, and a market. There is plenty of parking, and the public areas are always clean and well kept.  Town Square is a great place in Las Vegas!"
1,"The name explains it all. They have noodles served as soup and as dishes, in addition to other Asian options.  I've dined here 2x - once for dinner and once for lunch, both times were on a weekend.\n\nI'm not sure if they serve dim sum (in carts) for lunch every day but they do on Saturdays.  You have the option to order dim sum as appetizers regardless of day or time but be prepared to pay more than usual.  After all, we are at the Bellagio and not some random strip mall.  \n\nDuring the weekend lunch, while they're pushing carts, the dim sum rates aren't bad at all.  They're actually quite reasonable.  However, if you opt to get dim sum as appetizers in an \""off peak\"" time then it will cost 2 to 3 times as much. My fianc\u00e9 and I ordered dim sum, as appetizers, during dinner and paid ~$8 per order.  The Malaysian Fried Rice w/Beef and Hong Kong Egg Noodles w/Shrimp are delicious!\n\nI LOVE the Congee here. Surprisingly enough I didn't indulge in a noodle soup both times I dined here.  In fact, I only returned a 2nd time to have more porridge.  Their entrees are plentiful and great for sharing. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and food came out quick!"
0,This place is horrible. First the front receptionist so freakin rude as hell. The room dirty as f&$k. Shut off the water without notify the guest. The sheets and blankets has cigarette burnt hole..filthy place.
1,"Le Re've is probably my favorite show in Vegas. The view is good no matter where you sit, and the whole show is breathtakingly beautiful.\n\nThere is a circular stage in the middle immersed in water, and the audience sits around the stage. The performers enter and exit from the water and the ceiling, and the moves the pull off are simply amazing!\n\nBiggest props are definitely to whoever choreographed/designed the show. They definitely went all out with their imagination but were still able to create it in real life.\n\nThis show is definitely on the pricier side, but, as cliche as it sounds, it's worth every penny."
0,"I went to The Compound strictly to see a band play. I did not try any of the food, so I can only comment on this place as a music venue. \n\nThe Compound really needs to rethink the set up of this place. It's more of a resaurant and any band playing there almost gets resigned to background music. I don't like the set up of the tables. It's just not great for watching a band. You have the servers passing by every few minutes to take orders and deliver food to tables. This is distracting for someone trying to enjoy the music. \nI think it would be best if the restaurant was seperated from the stage area. \nThough the band I saw at The Compound was awesome, I would probably not go back to The Compound for a concert unless it was a band I was truly dying to see. The set up of this place I find just that bad. \nI may go back to try the food, but as far as seeing a band here the experience wasn't that great to make me come back for a concert."
0,I went there once and never plan to go back. Service was soooo slow as you'll see in many reviews down from me it appears a lot of others agree as well. Hopefully they are reading this and realize its not just one or two people that thinks its slow its multiple people. I also agree with the many comments saying how over priced and not worth it this place is.  \n\nMind you I was there when it was completely empty it was not during a rush it was less than half full and my server was nice but slow. She even noticed she was slow as she kept apologizing for the wait over and over. Instead of apologizing just speed it up.  When their own staff thinks they are slow thats when you know they are bad.\n\nSave your money and TIME and go somewhere else.
1,Arnica and health foods....all they need is an absinthe bar and they'd be perfect.
0,I am in a ton of pain and needed to see a back doctor.\nImagine my surprise when this practice said they wouldn't see me because I am paying cash.\nI was told that they ONLY see patients with insurance coverage.\nI guess it's easier to milk an insurance company than a cash paying patient.
1,"I came back to this casino/brewery for an early breakfast and final meal before my early flight to San Diego. \n\nMy lunch experience with the food two days ago were ok, but not great. But I was in a immediate rush and wanted to check out their breakfast. \n\nAt 6:30 am, surprisingly the cafe was packed. But I only had to wait 5-10 minute for a table. Every meal, the cafe has specials. And I had one of the meals, which is the Country Fried Steak Breakfast. For $5.99, I get one thick Chicken Fried Steak smothered with gravy, eggs (cooked any way including scrambled egg whites, in which I got), hash browns and toast (I got toasted Rye). The waitress, who took my order, was nice enough to allow me to take mashed potatoes instead of the hash browns.  I got to admit the breakfast was also cheap and a lot better than my lunch. Every items were cooked to perfection. \n\nMy meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=jC8Un2PffaoE5WaRkhY4UA\n\nMy coffee: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=7YP_jrvB7YJ9zaJhbsOTjw\n\nMy breakfast was a tad over $10.00. \n\nI just found out that the hole-in-the-wall casino is one of the hottest businesses in Las Vegas. The place and meal were ok, for the price."
0,"Dont get me wrong, I am a Juicy Coutureaholic!! I entered the store, and I was greeted nicely by a nice brunette.... She welcomed me and my fiancee.... We shopped around for about an hour, and ended up buying a necklace and a headband... lol..... on our way out, this stupid white bitch told us \""oh you guys are FINALLY leaving\""!!!! My man was mad, and i just acted like I didnt hear her..... If I would have said something I wouldnt be here typing this up.... : ) I do wish I could have socked the bitch ! I have called corporate...lol People like this should NOT be working here !"
1,"I love coming to this chipotle. It's so lively everytime I walk in. I love it. \nThey have their food fresh and ready to go for you. I guess it's because they're always busy that their food is always freshly made. But I have been to other chipotle and their food is definitely not the same.  \nThe staffs here are very friendly and nice. They're actually happy to work and serve you unlike other places. I did see one guy ,with a tattoo of a letter A on his left arm, fixing his underwear right where they hand you the food... D: lol kinda grossed me out a bit but I guess it's just a one time thing. I hope. \nAnyway, their tables and bathrooms are very clean. They always have someone cleaning everywhere so it's pretty clean. \nThe chefs are hilarious bc they actually talk to you and make jokes which I like because I'd always want to come back and eat. \nIt has such a chill and fun environment to be in while eating. \nIt was great. Thanks for reading and o hope this helps. :)"
0,"Went to watch the Hockey game at 6:15pm. At 8pm we were forced to pay 5$ each to carry on watching as there was a Bikini contest going on. I pointed out to our bar server that we weren't there for the Bikinis, but for the Hockey....still had to pay the money!!!\n\nWe paid, as we wanted to carry on watching the game. \n\nFor nearly 80 minutes the Bikini contest went on, the mic feeding back so badly it started to hurt my ears. \nAn attraction like that should be kept to 60 minutes. Drunk people attention span isn't that long !!! \n\n\nI work in sound and I offered a solution to both the bartender (not interested!!) and I even grabbed the manager. He told me that he had already mentioned it to the DJ. It would have been a simple solution of reducing the mic level, or the treble. Nothing was done and it carried on squealing back continuously. \n\nSeriously, If your DJ can't deal with simple mic issues like that, he should give up and find another career. \n\nBetween the 2 of us we spent over 100$, we would have been happy to go back for the remainder of the playoffs, but will now go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead. \n\nFood was Ok, drinks kept flowing. The place was busy, but if they want to keep it that way, sort out tech issues. \n\nI'm writing this 2 hours after leaving and my ears are still hurting!!!"
1,"This place is a must if you're going to Vegas to do the classic \""club/party/drink-all-night-with-friends\"" thing on the strip. Or if you like sandwiches/food/life. Even if this place has a huge line, it moves fast and efficient. Just don't expect to easily find a place to sit and eat!\n\nThe condiments and toasting make the sandwich. They absolutely do. I'm usually not a fan of mixed deli meats in a sandwich, but I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS make an exception for the Full Montagu. The toasted swiss and cheddar cheese give the roast beef and turkey such a rich flavor, and the acidity of the deli mustard just cuts through the heavy flavors and tie the sandwich into a perfect little package.\n\nYou can do no wrong with the Original either; roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. The horseradish doesn't overpower the sandwich and is not too spicy - it just gives the sandwich a necessary kick. So good!\n\nNow, I usually LOVE this place and would gladly give it 5-stars, but my last trip was the first time I've ever been disappointed. The disappointment  was with their new side: Bacon Macaroni and Cheese. Don't get me wrong - the macaroni and cheese itself tasted wonderfully salty, rich, and cheesy. What disappointed me was the bacon part. I expected it would be a macaroni and cheese cooked with diced up bacon or something, but when I opened the container, it was 2 slices of bacon (same bacon from sandwiches) placed on top of the mac and cheese and then toasted. Now, I don't know if bacon was cooked with the macaroni (I didn't see any pieces), but it just seemed kind of a lazy attempt to bacon macaroni and cheese. \n\nBut I would definitely go back again."
0,"The BLT Burger was okay.  I just came back from Las Vegas last night. On Friday, I was looking for the restaurant and it was hard to locate at first. There were nobody standing in line so I decided to try it out. I saw several reviews and they say it was the bomb. It was okay."
0,"I would give negative reviews if possible. This was the worst possible hotel experience ever! \n\nI booked two days in advance through Priceline, prepaid and assumed my hotel was booked. I drove all the way from Los Angeles and arrived at 11:45 pm. When I got to the hotel/motel and walked up to the check-in with my bags, the man at the counter said he indeed got the reservation but had failed to have the room cleaned and prepped for a guest. No big deal, there should be other rooms available right? Wrong! I was told that the hotel was completely booked due to a softball game in the area. When I asked for another room, he said, \"" Sorry, there's nothing I can do.\"" \n   When I mentioned that a hotel as fully booked as they are should have a full staff during such a busy season, he said he was the only person On duty and he would not prepare the room for me. I asked him to call the manager but he refused to do so. There was also two other families behind me about to encounter the same problem. Luckily I booked through Priceline and when I called them to inform them about the astronomical inconvenience, and they were able to get me into a 3.5 star Hilton @ squaw peak resort. I'll never make an attempt to stay at this hotel/motel again and I would advise against staying here to anybody I know. Epic fail Quality Inn!"
1,"This is a different type of dining experience. From the outside, it looks like an ordinary building, but the inside is nicely decorated. Wines selections are great. Staff are super friendly, especially for a mom-n-pop restaurant. The food (crepes) is definitely over the top. It's a specialty restaurant, meaning that you must really enjoy crepes to be able to appreciate what the owner's pride and their creativity of their food selections. It's not, by any mean, a fancy French dining but it's definitely a favorite local place. I enjoy dining here every single time, whether with friends, family, or with my nieces and nephews. The kids and I are throughly enjoy the crepes-bar by the kitchen, especially when we see the chefs prepare our favorite desserts. \nOn that note, this place is a gem...so come out and support the local business. I dine here, at least once or twice per month."
1,Awesome service. Awesome fresh breakfast. Our server Jackie was five star worthy all by herself!
0,"I wish I could give a zero star rating. Last night I brought my daughter to Barnes & Nobel to pick out a book. I've been coming to this location since it opened in 2001. In the last year I've noticed the book selection is getting smaller and smaller and the toy selection (and not educational toys) is getting larger and larger. Seriously, toys now occupy 15 - 20% of the store. Rather than go to the children's book area my daughter, naturally, wanted to check out the toys.  What happened to the zen atomosphere of the book store? If I wanted to be around a bunch of screaming kids I'd be at Toys ** Us.\n\nI went to share my opinion with the manager. She was very rude and said the toys sell better than the books and that Barnes & Nobel is closing stores that don't sell toys. \n\nBooks are my thing. I own an iPad, and iPhone, a touch laptop and a Samsung tablet. and guese what? I still prefer to buy the hard books rather than read them on an electronic device.  I love the feel of a book and I love to re-read them. I also spend a minimum of $2,500+ per year on books and magazines.  All at Barnes & Nobel.  But the dumb Barnes & Noble manager could care less. \n\nNote to Barnes & Noble - please do a better job training your managers to be more customer friendly. It would also help to hire managers that actually like to read."
0,"Never, Ever have I been told that you cannot have a glass of ice water at any restaurant or bar in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The temperatures in Las Vegas, Nevada in the Summer time can reach well into 115 degrees.  How can a place of business refuse a patron a cup of Ice water and insist that if you want water you must purchase a bottle of water? (Gold Diggers) the name does fit them well. They do not aim to serve their patrons at least this was how I was treated on the evening of 6-21-2013. My advice and recommendation as a native in Las Vegas, Nevada BEWARE!!!!  To all tourists or patrons this place of business only wants your money anyway they can get it!!!!  You might be left lying on the floor of this business with severe dehydration and they would not care. I will be on a mission to see how serving WATER to a patron at a bar or club in Las Vegas CANNOT be refused."
1,I'm a regular here.  The staff is pretty young and they handle themselves well even when it's busy.  They're always hospitable and make the visit pleasant...add that to good sandwiches and this location is a winner!  Nice job.
1,"Walked there from signature suites at mgm. I love the sandwiches.. So far I have had the bobby, cheesesteak, and capristrami. Small is like a medium and medium like a large. The capistrami is delist but the coleslaw got a littlest\nTy at the end. I would order it on the side next time. The Bobby seemed like it needed more mayo.otherwise tasted great.i love how all the sauce, meat stayed in the bun bc of the cool rolls.. cheesteak was tasty. Finished the medium there, wished the steak was a little thinner."
0,"Thank you, Lonie. I appreciate you taking the time to reply. And you know my review wasn't malicious, just a factual accounting of how the visit unfolded. My brother's tip $? I wasn't aware, but I think that's how he expressed his feeling of also being non-plussed. \n\nCuriously, I did receive a Yelp \""compliment\"" from a certain male related to Nosh & Swig soon after my review. This compliment simply stated, \""You're a bitch.\"" So you might want to check with your cook-husband (or other partners?) to see if they felt the need to reach out to me in that particular way. [Definitely not returning, now... Who knows what would befall my food.]\n\nLastly, I've had no less than 10 \""thank you's\"" from fellow Yelpers regarding my review. Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare, and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.\n\nGood luck and continue with the improvements. Make sure you let the good reviews happen organically and honestly. And maybe take the Yelp keys away from whomever thinks its ok to be nasty to us patrons."
0,"My Flight from Phoenix to Vegas was delayed by over an hour. A few days later and our return flight was delayed also... WTF? I've flown SWA extensively for work but they are making me reconsider. What happened to the best on-time performance.\n\nAlso on the flight here no drink service on the flight due to turbulence. There were a few bumps but c'mon it was a flight to Vegas.!!! I have experienced much worse and still got a coke or beer. Also the flight attendants had ZERO personality. That makes up for a lot (cattle car boarding, packing us in like sardines, dealing with airport security, etc)\n\nYou have work to do SWA..."
1,Great little airport. It has a nice restaurant inside with neat model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Nice little lobby too.
1,"The food was so good!  We started with a pitcher of the honey porter, which was quite tasty, and the Tuscan Salad.  After having the salad, I almost didn't even want to have pizza- it was sooo good!  \n\nFor pizza, we ordered a half and half- Sunspot and Gotham. After a full slice of the the Sunspot, I only had room for a bite of the Gotham, but both were delicious. The Sunspot tasted light and fresh, despite it being really filling. The Gotham, from what I had, was really meaty and just as good.\n\nThe pizza is pretty heavy, so I would say not to expect to get past a couple slices.  There were 3 of us, and we ended up bringing half the large pizza home.  Definitely making a trip back."
0,So I ordered from eat24.com and waited for lefty's to deliver my food. About and hour and a half later I finally get connected with someone at lefty's telling me that they had put my receipt order down somewhere and forgot about it. Then telling me they had issues with the website after the employee told me what they had just done. About 2 hours and some odd mins I finally get my food. Then they tell me that I have a credit for the amount I ordered and just to call them next time for the order. Then I call them a month later telling them that I have credit for the messed up order and lefty's tells me that I have already used the credit when I never did. These people just don't want to lose money apparently.
0,"Smashburger was simply ok. The food was not horrible, but based on overall value, it is not that great. It is expensive for what is served."
0,"Dined on a Saturday night, it was busy. Snacked on the plate of pickles. Tasty. Ordered chili and latkes to get started. Chili was ok, Latkes were decent had to request applesauce and sour cream. \n\nOrdering an Italian sandwich in a Jewish Deli wasn't the brightest on my part, but I wanted to see how it was. Not great, as you can probably imagine. Meats were overly salted, and the Italian bread was unlike any other Italian bread I've had before.\n\nPastrami/corned beef  Ruebens are the way to go. Tasty, but pricey."
1,"Let me just say I LOVE this salon! I went in yesterday to get my nails re-done because the last job I had was horrible, and I came out AMAZED with the work. I have known Marisa the nail tech since grade school, but had not work done by her. This salon is so clean, and the staff is incredibly sweet! Marisa took her time with my nails, and they came out as the best set I have ever had, and I have been getting my nails done for well over 8 years. I received 30% off my first visit which was great! They definitely care about their clients, and the work they do! If you really want quality work done, then go here! You can have quality work for cheap! They're prices are a little higher than most places, however the work they do is well worth the cost trust me! They also  have a membership package!"
0,"I hate to write such a negative review, but this might be the worst pizza I've ever had delivered. Womp womp. Even the  antipasto salad was disappointing (black olives, tomatoes, and bell peppers on a bed of lettuce) :T"
1,"Let me preface this review by saying that I in no way would be able to afford this restaurant on my own. But since I was here with my co-workers for a work dinner we got to expense it (woo-hoo!). \n\nWe were here on a Sunday night for dinner and sat in the main dining area. There's a section that's very loungy with couches that overlooks the Bellagio...great view but the couches seem like they would be uncomfortable to eat an entire meal on. \n\nI got a bottle of the Star Rabbit sparkling sake- my ultimate favorite drink! I never find it anywhere and I was so excited they had it here. \nWe started with the Cucumber Sunomono- a light pickled cucumber salad. I thought it was a great refereshing way to start the meal. Then we got the Vegetable Tempura which had asparagus, onions, shiitake mushrooms, eggplant, green beans and yams. I thought it was delicious. We also started with the Tuna Sashimi which was to die for. It came served on top of the most amazing sauce with jalapeno and garlic chips. One of my co-workers also ordered the kobe beef potstickers which he said were fabulous.\nFor our entree I shared the Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable rolls which were all great. The spicy tuna was my favorite. A little random but we also shared a side of the Shishito Mashed Potatoes which were so creamy and delectable. \n\nDessert had to be the most amazing part of the meal. We ordered the dessert platter which consisted of Molten Chocolate Cake, Koi's Signature Cheesecake (white chocolate with raspberries....YUM), Berry Cobbler w/ice cream, and Vanilla Creme Brulee. Oh. My. GOD. \nIt was so incredible. Between 6 people we devoured the entire thing. \n\nOur service was a little slow at times but our waiter was still attentive and very nice. \nAll in all a fabulous experience."
1,"This is the best brunch in Madison - doesn't suffer from the weekend morning crowds, within walking distance of the farmer's market, and a quiet atmosphere. Food is excellent. I recommend the chilaquiles - they're the best I've ever had. Brunch is really affordable, dinner is a little more pricey. Owned by an artist, local art is always on display."
1,"When I do get coffee or the urge for caffine, I'd probably pick Caribou over those other chains.  I still haven't really found a homey mom and pop corner coffee shop, but I haven't exactly been looking that hard either.\n\nThis location is pretty convenient and the people are nice - not a huge location so it seems like there are always people here.  May be hard when you come and it's busy to get a table/place to sit.\n\nI happened to wander in after having a hearty meal at Chipotle next door.  Good way to cap the dinner off... unfortunately I was wired for the rest of the night.  A+ on the effective caffeine content of your coffee.... F for me for not being smart and drinking coffee after dinner on a Sunday night.   Monday was quite a long day after a sleepless night.  Fail on my part."
0,"Slow service, weak margaritas and stale chips. Not coming back."
0,We were all gung ho to go until we got to the door and found out that strollers were not allowed. You are expected to carry your kids....I THINK NOT! Now if they had mentioned this on their website we would have known about this up front. We went to the Mob Experience at the Tropicana instead. They are kid friendly!!
1,"We love this place. It's awesome delivery service. We have eaten here for 3+ years and the food is always very good, especially for the prices. When we order, they always tell us about 30 min for delivery but then show up in 20 min with very HOT food. The restaurant itself is not anything pretty or nice. If you can look past cosmetics, you will enjoy the food."
1,"My experience: \n\nMy sister-in-law, Kari Gibney works at Salon Surreal as an aesthetician (or however you spell it! - She does great facials, waxing, etc.).  \n\nI am starting a new job tomorrow and woke up and decided I desperately needed a new hair-do!!  So, I thought I'd try out her place....even though I  was tempted to try out the nearby Supercuts because I am broke.  \n\nBut, I came to my senses and thought I better not take that chance and go ahead and get a good cut.  So, after reading all the previous reviews and talking with Kari I was so excited to get in (the same day I called) to see the proclaimed Bobby - apparently a hair guru.  \n\nI have to say, it was the best cut I've had in a long time.  I had been going to another salon and paying $40 for the haircut.  It was always just okay.  Bobby's haircut was $45 and SO WORTH that extra $5!!!  He was completely friendly and easy-going.  He gives the best scalp and neck massage too!!!  My previous stylist never did that!!!\n\nThe salon is open and everyone seems very friendly - plus they have ice water, iced tea (in actual glasses instead of styrofoam cups) and cookies.... which my old salon never had/offered.   \n\nMy hair is thin and frustrating to work with because it's also frizzy/kinky/curly.  But, he gave me a new cut (I've always done some version of a bob) that is so cute!!! I love it!!!  And he could blow-dry it so it was smooth looking (without a flat-iron)!\n\nSo, I think I'll stick with Bobby from now on!\nAnd if you need a good aesthetician ask for Kari Gibney!!!\n\nP.S. I do want to point out - as an overall salon it's not the best out there in terms of design/decor/atmosphere - the decor is kind of outdated and it's not as serene as I think salons should be.  But, I gave the place 5-stars because for the moderate price range it's pretty darn good.  I'd challenge you to find a more opulent salon for the same prices.  I'm sure there are some amazingly designed salons out there that are opulent, modern, luxurious, etc - but their haircuts are not gonna be $45!  Just wanted to make that point."
1,We are from out of town and were getting married in Vegas.  We were able to put our order in online the morning we flew out and it was ready for one of our local friends to pick up by the time we got there.  They made it so easy to get what we wanted in a timely and convenient manner.  They even called to verify the order since all my info was not local.  Very friendly to work with.
0,"Prices are expensive and food is not good.... I do like the outdoor seating and its great for groups but they need to step up with their food. Everything sounds so yummy on the menu but when it comes out its bland, maybe its what we ordered?  The waitress also took forever to give us our check.  I'm not sure I need some convicing to come back."
0,"I haven't even tried the food. I came for brunch in April with my dog because it states on Yelp that this restaurant is pet friendly. However, the tables outside are in direct sunlight and the waitress informed me there were no umbrellas to provide shade. When I asked for a bowl of water, they didn't have one. So I left and went to Bar + Bistro at the Arts Factory where they have a very dog friendly covered patio and bottomless mimosas during Sunday brunch.\n\nRestaurants should NOT advertise that they allow dogs if they're not willing to make basic accommodations."
0,Horrific customer service & owning up to poor quality workmanship. Manager (very rude & snooty) redirected & basically blamed BFF that she must have stored it (never used new) incorrectly for the handle to leak glue & damage the purse. She wouldnt issue a credit & said it couldn't be fixed w/o $ or guarantee. NEVER buy LV! BUY Gucci across the mall from them. Too bad cause sales staff was great though.
0,"I was visiting AZ recently and had dinner with my family here.  The food was ok, not great and I thought the entrees were a bit pricey.  All in all it was ok, until we went to pay the check.  We were a large group and paid with cash and a credit card.  When we got the bill to sign, we realized he did not apply the full $100 in cash that we gave along with the credit card.  When we questioned the waiter, he got very defensive and pulled $40 out of his POCKET and said we only gave $40.  WTH? Why is it in his pocket and not the register??  We were adamant that we gave $100, he went inside and came back 10 min later with his Manager and apologized for the mix up.  The waiter said someone found it on the floor, while the Mgr said another waiter found it in the bill folder.  So which is it?  We thought we had the bill squared away until we checked our credit card online and we were charged the full amount 2x and now they won't provide a credit.  This really soured our experience, I've never seen anything like this before.  The food was ok but after this business with the check, I don't think we can go back.  Hopefully the credit card company can clear up the discrepancy."
1,"If you enjoy (and really who doesn't) amazing and fresh produce, wild caught meats, etc. then definitely check out the Old Town Farmer's Market every Saturday from 8am to 1pm. We've been a few times already and need to get a 2nd produce only fridge in the near future as we come home with way to much each time. McClendon's Farm is the main produce provider at the Old Town Farmer's Market and some of the best produce I have seen.\n\nIf you go make sure to bring your reusable environmental friendly bags to put all your produce into. If you forget they have plastic bags. Really fun walking around to meet the other local vendors, try out their delicious foods and get outdoors in downtown Scottsdale."
0,"We didn't get an opportunity to eat here because we had to leave due to the service being slow. We came in at 7:15am to eat breakfast, we were here before work so we had about 40mins we could spend here. At 7:30 our order was taken but the cook was doing some sort of inventory so our food wasn't going to be getting prepared for some time. We asked them to cancel their order and said thank you and the woman upfront just ignored me. I was at no point being rude with her but she felt the need to be dismissive towards me. She didn't even great us when we walked in, they actually looked at us shocked that someone would come in within their business hours.\n\nI pretty much only shop local and if I can't shop local I at least purchase products manufactured in the U.S.A.  It's a real shame to me when I go to try a new LOCAL place and the service is that bad, I know we weren't there for that long, but you can tell right when you walk into a place how the service is going to be by how you're greeted or lack there of.  I wish I had an opportunity to try their food, had they been more focused on the customer and not on inventory that should have been completed prior to opening then I'd probably be writing a different review right now."
1,"Dim sum is hot, comes around frequently and the people are nice.  I do think they are a little over priced and sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated because they can stamp any price section without me verifying it's the right price for the item I got. \n\nBut the food is good and service is fine.  Oddly enough I always bring my own chopsticks though because theirs are VERY waxy and hard to eat with."
1,Stopped in because I was in the area. The service here is very attentive and the food is truly authentic and definitely 'muy bien'.  I had a pollo and al pastor taco with a steak gordito. All of it was gone within minutes. The salsa is home made and probably one of my favorite parts of the meal!
1,I love this place 4 story building of all M&M merchandise. There are only 4 of these stores in the world and this one is cool. I love the unique items you can only find in a M&M world store
0,"This place really is a pukehole, but I may try it again just because I love  abuse and I guess I'm into non high-end vegas places. I hate to diss anyone or anywhere, please try it and write your own conclusions."
0,"I almost fell asleep at this show, unfortunately one of the worst I've ever seen.  What you pay for is to see an impressive stage that goes up and down and 360 degrees, sound effects, but not really a good story or strong incredible cirque de soleil material.  I would most definitely recommend the Mystre show at treasure island instead.  the problem I think was that story was sad and long and not something you'd get pumped up for and get entertained which is what the majority of goers want right?"
0,"This place is not the business! The drinks are not even that great. My friend got a watermelon slush and it tastes so fake and literally looks like pepto dismal. The coffee is OK but they put way too much ice in the drinks where ice is up to the way top. Service is not good, the girl that was taking my order was giving attitude. I won't be coming here again. The one in California is way better."
0,I don't order from this dominos anymore.  The reason?  I could never get off hold whenever I called to place an order.  I have to drive 6 miles each way out of my way to pick up from another domino's.  One time I left my phone on speaker just to see how long I would be on hold.  I hung up after 10 minutes.  Terrible.
1,"Hugo's Cellar was the first \""fancy schmancy\"" restaurant that my husband (then boyfriend) tried in Vegas about six years ago. I remember being very impressed by the high class service and the intricately made food. I wondered, was this place good because it was in my pre-Yelp days? Or was it really THAT good? Yes, sir, this place is as good as I remembered.\n\nThis restaurant is in an unlikely location. It's inside Four Queens. Downtown Las Vegas has drastically improved over the last few years but admittedly I still hold my purse close to me when I walk around. I would highly suggest to valet your car because the garage elevator was broken and I had to go down four flights of stairs in heels! Hey, if you're going to a fancy schmancy restaurant, you might as well splurge on valet!\n\nOnce you get to the restaurant, ladies are given a single red rose. The restaurant is dark and has a old school Vegas feel. We were seated in a booth, and I appreciated the romantic ambiance. Waiters were all wearing tuxedos. They even poured water with a certain flair.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is the table side prepared salad. It comes free with your entree and you get an array of toppings to choose from! They give a cute mini raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palette. I ordered the ribeye steak and my husband got the Chilean sea bass. We both savored every single bite and still had leftovers to take home! \n\nI'm not sure if it's because they knew it was our anniversary but we got hooked up with lots of desserts! We got an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots to dip in whipped cream. Then we got a chocolate mousse cake that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Oh my, my mouth is watering just writing about it.\n\nIf you're looking for romance, good food and great service, you can't go wrong with Hugo's Cellar!"
1,"Good beer on tap, delicious sandwich (The Pear is a favorite), and rotating art shows. Also a few nights with live music. I tend to pass by this place on first friday as it gets a bit crowded, but other than that, I have no complaints about this restaurant. Chill vibe, and tasty treats, whats not to love."
1,"I ate this food last monday to go. Food was pretty good. You just need to know what to order and how spicy you want it on a 10 scale. I enjoyed their crab ragoon which was pretty big in size. and this dish that is similar to pad thai, drunken noodles?, was really good, and of course, other entrees. The first time my boyfriend and i dined here we weren't too happy, but now that we know what to order, I would recommend this place. Food can get a bit pricey. Like the crab ragoon was 10 bucks and you only get four, but it's so good you would want more."
0,"Inedible, intolerant & indelible\n\nI will never forget the miserable excuse for food my wife, baby, friends and I were served with such contempt.\n\nLuke warm chips, would have been better than the soggy cold items which garnished my burger. \n\nThe staff couldn't have been less interested in providing actual service either. As other reviewers have said, it felt like they really didn't way to be there at all. \n\nStill, on the bright side, at least I now know why it always looks empty when I pass, because it, along with the Filling Station are the last two bastions of shite on the High Street section of the Royal Mile."
0,"Bar Area great for chips/salsa and cheap beer.\n\nThe ribs tasted like they were previously-frozen, and microwaved. The burgers were not that good.\n\nThe food should be better for what they charge here."
0,"I live in Power Ranch, so its a toss up as to whether its more convenient to go here or the Home Depot on Power Rd.  I've tried both multiple times, and I find a HUGE difference.  At this Lowe's, its very hard in every department to get someone to help.  The layout seems to have been designed to hide what I'm looking for. \nI'm glad they are here as an alternative for that occasion where that \""other\"" store doesn't have what I need, but from now on it is always option B for me."
1,I woekd for el molinos for 17 plus years this place makes FRESH HOMEMADE MEXICAN FOOD !! so all you jokers who eat tex mex mexican food have no clue what good mexican food is i love el molinos and momma and of course lupe all my family and your loss if you dont go back !! BEST MACHACA EVER AND GREEN CORN TAMALES!!!!
0,"I came here on a Wednesday for dinner around 5pm. There wasn't really anyone there but also the place is huge so I'm sure you can come anytime without having to wait. \n\nI got the Enchiladas Mexicanas which comes with 3 enchiladas with your choice of chicken, beef, cheese only, or beans on the inside and either the green or red sauce (you can get both too).\n\n I got 2 chicken and 1 beef with both the red and green sauce. It wasn't all that great the red sauce was better than green and the protein was 'whatever.' \n\nAlso their menu was a little bit confusing. It was ridden with typos and errors so some of the items on the menu didn't make any sense and had to be clarified by the waiter. \n\nI wouldn't come again...I would probably go to Las Palmas for some yummy tacos."
1,"The first thing you need to know, Insert Coins is genius. Ask yourself, \""how do I get people to come to my bar and stay there?\"" this place nails it with its Outside-of-the-Vegas-Box atmosphere. This place draws EVERYONE in whether you're a mega video game nerd or the hippest hipster on Fremont who just left The Griffin across the street. A sausage fest? Debatable. Awesome, one hell of a good time and a place any chick can appreciate and love? FACT. Anyone hoping to open their own bar can take a few notes from the people who opened this joint.\n\nInsert Coins is filled with what looks like local art you can actually purchase, contemporary/modern bright wonderful furniture, old school arcade games and a fabulous bar where you can sit and play video games for FREE while you drink. The staff is amazing too. Super friendly and personable without being cheesy and over the top. This is an extremely popular spot so be prepared to rub shoulders with some close friends and strangers. \n\nWhoever did the interior design for this place needs to come visit me in UT. I LOVED the retro furniture and especially loved the large sea foam green/turquoise toned couch. The two negative things I can say about this place? 1- The music. It is absolutely horrible. Not bad enough to keep me away. And 2- Whoever designed the space could have moved things around a little more. The bar area is amazing. Nice long horizontal bar in the middle of the room with big tv's on the wall above you for you to enjoy a little gaming while you drink and an awesome counter that lights up under you. The rest of the room is crammed in some areas and completely open and blank in others. The art is cluttered on the walls around all the arcade games that are also cluttered around each other. Have fun trying to play while people bump into you and have fun trying to walk through looking at art with everyone hanging and playing games. The back of the bar where the DJ is is completely wide open and kind of an eye sore. They made a poor attempt at filling the space by putting two large wrap around couches for people to sit at. It doesn't exactly flow. The other side of the room has huge amazing couches where you can sit and play games but... the tv's don't even face the chairs. Kind of confusing.\n\nThis place is rad and easily my second favorite bar to date right behind The Griffin my hipster haven across the street. Two of my favorite bars are located in a stat I don't even live in. Check it out the next time you make a Vegas trip!"
1,"A close contender for my favorite Mexican food.\n\nIt's not the most flavorful I've had, but it makes up for that in freshness. Besides, who needs their freshly grilled asada loaded up with salt? Get the California burrito and their cantaloupe agua fresca...you won't regret it.\n\nIf you're feeling brave, get one of those awesome looking seafood dishes on the menu. It almost seems to be their specialty. Come here on Friday/Saturday when the lobby is open 24 hours, and if weather permits, enjoy your time on the comfy patio adjacent to busy 59th avenue traffic. Sounds tacky, but you'll like it.\n\nI think I'll be grabbing a midnight snack."
1,"Airworx is great. I live right by Jumpstreet and I will pass it by to make the drive to Airworx. It is cleaner, has more activities, and you can actually jump with your kid. There was a DJ booth and great music, and they let us stay way longer than what we had actually paid for. After Jumpstreet made all these ridiculous new changes and continues to employ some of the rudest people in town, I see no reason  to go anywhere other than Airworx!"
0,"While the title might be better suited for a Manhattan Chelsea night club, the allure of Jody Maroni's is an easy one here at Sky Harbor - everyone hates the typical airport food options but most folks (even vegans) love hot dogs.\n\nBut these hot dogs aren't even worthy of a Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi throw down. They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.\n\nI can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.\n\nThe biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.\n\nIn the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) \""meat in tube form\"" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon."
1,"A warm homey place, nice owner. Food was well prepared. Not a wide variety of pastas, in fact, the menu was verbally told to me by the owner/ chef. Overall, a good experience."
1,"This place is awesome and freaky. Every wax figure looks SO REAL. My peripheral vision was playing tricks on me, I'd see someone out of the corner of my eye and think it was a real person but no, it was Ryan Seacrest or Shaq. Duh! \n\nCool tip here - get your tickets at The Venetian front desk! They will sell them to you for $19 which is less than Madame Toussad's price of $26 (even with their $4 coupon)."
0,"I chose this hotel because it's where I always stayed as a kid with my family. Too bad nothing has changed since. The hotel is outdated, the furniture is banged up and even the doors themselves could use a serious coat of paint. We had to have an engineer come up and replace two light bulbs upon walking into our room. For what I'm paying I would have expected something better than motel 6. You can hear EVERYTHING outside of your room so if you're a light sleeper forget about it. Not worth it for the location."
1,"I had an EXCELLENT time at Moon with my friends. First off, the DJ was resident Clinton Sparks and he was throwing a party for himself while we were there. He was great! Top 40 mix with hip hop added. \n\nWe got hooked up with BOGO bottle service for 4 people and comped admission to all the other Palms clubs that night. We didn't get a chance to venture out, because we were having a way better time at Moon.\n\nThe bottles were 425 + tax and gratuity. Such a good deal since it was bogo. Our promoter Jamaal Rouzan was great! \n\nThe table was off the dance floor, and our waitress was great, she was always quick to be there to pour us drinks with a smile, and even danced the night away with us at one point. The bus boy was also great and gave me this flashy light thing :)\n\nI even got the bouncer to do a little bop and fist pump at one point! \n\nThe table was very large considering it was the 4 of us. At one point 6 of our friends joined us and there was PLENTY of room for them to sit as well! So much better than being crammed in Marquee -_-;;;\n\nAlthough this is a smaller club, I enjoyed my time here much better than I did in the ultra packed Marquee. People are just much friendlier, table service went off without a hitch. They even gave us a ton of free FIJI waters and the mixers were NOT diluted like the other clubs. I believe we also had 2 red bulls :)"
0,"You couldn't pay me to come back here.  The food was below average at best.  I tried everything from Italian, Mexican, Asian, American food.  Everything was sub par and the desert was bad.  I would think if you like home town buffet then this place is for you.  If not, head over to Wynn or Bellagio for their buffet."
1,All I can say is it's the best buffet in Vegas. \n\nThe amount of options you have to choose from can't be beat. And the food is restaurant quality. Anything you try there you are guaranteed to like. \nThe only thing I wish they worked on is the dessert. It was Ok...Some of it appeared sophisticated but most of it was nothing special. Of course I'm not comparing Wynn's desserts to Hometown Buffet...I'm only comparing it to other buffets on the strip. \nThey should look into what's offered at Paris if they want to steal all their customers :)
0,"A friend of mine works at Talking Stick Resort, she has been there since day 1, she helped open the resort five years ago.  She invited me to fly down to from Chicago to Arizona for a two day Staycation at the resort with her. We planning on visiting their famous Orange Sky restaurant, day of swimming and massages.  Unfortunately, Talking Stick Resort does not offer their own employees any discounts on rooms, or their amenities.  This is deeply disappointing.  Don't they realize the best advertising for people who are visiting their resort  is word of mouth by employees.  How can an employee recommend a restaurant, golfing, a spa treatment, or even give advise on what the rooms look like if they have no idea themselves.  I worked at 4 Diamond resort in Chicago and they offered their employees many discounts.  This was their way of thanking the employees for their hard work, as well as providing them with the information, tools and knowledge of what their property had to offer. I also worked for a travel agency, which flew me to all of their properties so I could have an idea of all the amenities each property had to offer.  This is basic travel industry 101.   I am deeply disappointed that a company would not offer room discounts to its own employees.  I don't think I will be visiting this resort during my trip to Scottsdale."
0,"Fans of the dramatic misfortunate adventures of RyanC read on...\n\nWikiWiki, whose name creates instant old school rap flashbacks*, catered the recent Tiki Party PBR Concert featuring Fishbone and other cool local acts.\nThe grilled meat smelled good (although when does grilled meat not) so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu: \n\n$5 Chicken \n$7 Beef Short Ribs\nor $7 Meat Combo\n\n-all with white rice and macaroni salad.\n\nI ordered the combo.  A few moments later I opened up the styrofoam clamshell the Young Male (YM) staffer handed me.  I'd gotten all rice,and there were in fact two small icecream scooper mounds of glutenous grain, but slapped on top of it was one small piece of chicken, perhaps one very small or half a large deboned thigh, and one small strip of short rib, which had less meat than a steroid-addict musclebound lunkhead's got in his roomy banana hammock.\n\nI extended my hand holding the food back towards him and said \""that's all I get?\""\nMaking no gesture towards grabbing the tray at all, he replies matter-of-factly, \""that 's how much you get.\""\nAfter spending a few moments politely describing the larger portions I've seen everyone else sporting and asking for either more food or a discount, YM refuses.\nAnother patron has arrived and is loose on PBR, so is standing way too close for my personal space comfort, but this means he's heard me and YM talking.  Let's call him Drunken Dirtbag (DDB).  Now, DDB is amused by all of this, but he's also hungry, so he asks YM to rustle him up a Chicken Plate with Mac and rice.  YM doesn't even hesitate, but instantly offers DDB my plate of food, saying \""You want to buy this? He doesn't want it anymore so you can just pay him\""\nI've been holding this food in my personal possession for over 5 minutes now, and although i never spit on it or anything, YM doesn't know that!  Is this even something allowed by health laws?\nDDB chuckles heartily but declines, saying he just wants the $5 chicken plate.  \""Me too....now\"", I contribute.\nI explain to YM that I will just have to alleviate my feelings of being ripped off by causing him to lose some significant business.  I won't lie or make anything up, I'll just show anyone who steps up to order exactly how much food they can expect for their money, and then they can decide if it's worth it, instead of having to be surprised and disappointed like me.\nYM: \""Go ahead.\""    \nGame on, this should be fun.  `,8^ )\n\nActually, it wasn't even working out that well, since more than half of those I showed still wanted to order, but I did get some sympathizers who joined my protest.\n\nMy friends were also supportive, letting me be, and checking back in on me after several minutes.  I was getting a little tired of holding onto my principals by this point, when OF, sorry that's the Older Female staffer from WikiWiki, came over with 7 single$ fanned out like a hand of cards, excitedly letting me know, \""Okay, here.  You can go now.  Seven dollars. Here.\""  This was not her coming rushing in to save the situation, no, no.  This was a good 15 minutes after my initial order now.  This was her resigning herself to the fact that I wasn't going to go away, and the night was still young.\n\nI smiled at her, turned around and set my tray on the table, giving YM a snarkily satisfied smirk, and went back to the festivities, proud and bully-ish feeling at the same time.\n\nAs far as the restaurant istelf, well, it is run by these grumpy stubborn, non-customer-service oriented folks, apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place, nor ever eating their overpriced, underwhelming food ever again.\n\n\n*yes, my friend Eric and I really did break dance to that song in 5th and 6th grade.\nJam on it...Jam on it...Jam, Ja-J-J-J-J-Jam on it!"
0,"I really hate to do this- updating a review with a lower star score. I raved about this place not two months ago and had an amazing first visit. I came back this evening  specifically because it was so awesome. I ordered nearly the exactly the same thing...but it feels like I was at an entirely different restaurant- and not in a good way.\n\nOrdered the ahi tuna tacos for myself, again, and my guy opted for the spicy thai chicken wrap this time, with the same side of Brussels sprouts. \nTacos were not as big as last time, and other than the fish, they only contained carrots (no cilantro?), one lonely avocado slice, and a squirt of sauce. What was fresh and popping with flavor last time was underwhelming and bland this time, and the bottoms of the tacos were drenched to the point that they were nearly soggy with lime juice (or maybe it was water from the carrots?) and dripping everywhere.\nThe wrap had a lot of very spicy sauce- possibly meant to drown out the small amount of dry chicken. Wrap, like the tacos, had noticeably less filling this time, and the flavor was off balance: proportions wrong, overwhelming sauce, not much else to speak of.\nEven the sprouts, so delicious and flavorful last time, were the last item out and somehow undercooked- left half the bowl behind, flavorless and rock-hard.\n\nI have no idea what happened.\nThe food wasn't anywhere near as good as our first visit. I'll give them one more try, maybe today was an off day, but the differences were like night and day... I want the tacos I had in March back! :("
1,"A formal event such as a graduation ball is difficult to review in a place like this for many reasons, but, I shall attempt it the rebellious soul that I am!  \n\nFirst of all, for me, a well organized affair like this one is like a warm, wooly blanket on a wintery December night. Nothing is more annoying than an event that's badly organized and wastes precious limited time we have in this crazy little thing called life. From the moment we arrived suited and booted, we were ushered, in a line towards the opulent hall upstairs in a single filed line so immaculately neat, I thought I was taking part in the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. The day was a breeze without many hiccups and thus we were all left to revel in our grand surroundings. \n\nI have not much to say about the main hall, aside from the fact that it resembles somewhere a Billionaire would host a cocktail party and perhaps invite Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko. So I did my best Bond impressions as I mingled in the post event Champagne and canape session. As if the Gold chandeliers hanging from an incredibly high ceiling and the huge glass windows weren't groovy enough. The two large walls on either side of the hall adorned some of the biggest mirrors I've ever seen.  This feature only served to enhance the sheer size of the place. \n\nThis is a fantastic venue and I'll plead ignorance for anything beyond that given my limited experience of Edinburgh. All I know is that the staff were impeccable and Assembly Rooms as a name doesn't do justice to the lavish nature of this humble abode."
1,I came on a Tuesday evening and since I am over 50 (barely) dinner was 1/2 off. Amazing. The waitress recommended a Chimichanga with shredded beef.  Loved it. And the white death margarita was great and it was pretty big. Good stop. I recommend this place if you are looking for a friendly family Mexican restaurant.  Bill came to $15.  What a deal!
1,"Dear Mr. Fez,\n\nPlease offer your restaurant skills to other establishments in the Valley, they desperately need your help.  Perhaps you could write a book on how to make your food, service, and restaurant atmosphere not suck.  I'm sure you'd have to include many pictures and only use small words because most other restaurateurs are feeble minded.\n\nThis world is not fair. There is only one FEZ but 10,000 crappy chain restaurants, all of which suck.\n\nPlease keep doing what you do and hopefully it will rub off on a few other places in Arizona.\n\nThank you,\n\nSatisfied Costumer."
1,My Husband went to Porta Bella for the 1st Tuesday. We are in Madison alot but never went in. We are glad we did.\n\nThe bread dipping sauce was mind blowing. I had the Porta Bella Linguine with a glass of house Chianti. It was wonderful. \n\nOur waiter was great the atmosphere is romantic old supper club style. I have one suggestion. Recover those cool booths. The floral prints are mauve dated 80's grandma. \n\nWe will be back!
1,"Not only does LBS have an amazing decor, but they have great food and cold beer!  You walk in and are mesmerized by the cowboy/boudoir/irish pub feeling and just have to sit at the bar!  They have a great hefeweisen on tap and the sliders are to die for!  I have had everything from the zucchini fries to the turkey burger and the southwest chicken salad- happy every time!  Great for Summerlin locals, and right in the beautiful Red Rock Casino!  Give it a try!"
0,"normally i would never return to this shop's review, but i have been personally messaged by the owner with some profane language and threats.\n\njust because i think you run a horrible business and lack any skill at what you do, doesn't mean you can personally message previous customers and harass them.\n\nbeware if you leave a negative comment here. he will harass you."
0,Unfortunately this place is going downhill. Not sure the reason. Poor service with ok food.
0,"So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didn't hit this buzzer beater.\n\nFirst off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs. \n\nThats pretty much where it stops. The food isn't great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didn't impress me. Plus the service was super slow...\n\nThis kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."
0,sandwich is ok. substandard ingredients. Lots of turnover of staff and limited in numbers. They beat Jimmy Johns but not Portillos.
0,"More authentic than places like Panda Express, but definitely not somewhere I'd go for quality Chinese food. I went with a big group and we ordered a variety of dishes off the menu. Overall their prices are low, but their food is rather one-dimensional. And they drench almost all of their dishes in thick sauces, making them feel greasy and unhealthy. \nWhile the service is good and they have a lot of seating for large groups, the food is nothing more than something cheap and filling."
1,"Good service, actual Irish people! And I have to say, I loved the physical bar here--absurdly ornate, reminds me of Bourbon Street in the Theatre District..."
1,"I always heard of the great food here and I had a chance finally to try it out. I'm a huge fan of large portions and my dish was gigantic. I ordered a braised pork with a creamy sauce and fingerling potatoes. It was just as I would have expected from a place like this. \n\nThey are very busy and I can see why. The decor, and ambiance is very inviting for a couple to larger groups. I love the drinks and the wine list is a bit over whelming for a amateur wine drinker like me. \n\nI saw so many things on the menu I wanted to try but I did not want to look like a fatty in front of my date. I might have to sneak back over there on my next day off. \n\nI recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food and doesn't have any hang ups of trying new things. Next is FnB!!"
1,Starbucks....can't live without it
1,This place is awesome.  I don't try new places but I found a gem in The Sugar Factory.  Chef Chris and Chef Alejandro really did a great job on my food.  I'm highly critical of food expecially pasta because it's so easy to make.  These guys outdid themselves.  I'll be back soon for food and of course drinks.  Thanks guys!
0,"Raised prices and coupons don,t include any 12 inch sandwich specials. Used to buy here weekly but no longer can afford it especially with the fact that they give less meat and cheese then Port of Subs."
0,Why are the iced coffee cups smaller in this store than every other McDonald's yet the price is still the same?!?! Not impressed! :/
0,I rented here on 4/26-4/27 and can fully agree with the other reviewers.\n\n60 minute wait to get a car and 30 minute wait just to return it.\n\nThe place seems understaffed with no processes in place.\n\nSTAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!
1,"So far so good, just started my second week of the foundation class (the beginner ones) via a living social coupon. Will is a great instructor he explains all of the moves  and provides great motivation. I have been slacking in my workouts and this has been a great way to jump start my exercise routines again. I do like that they incorporate running into the warm ups and work outs  because that's something I'm currently (slowly) trying to build up. \nIt was hard for me to find this place , but if you turn on reams road make a right into the office complex then go ALL the way around the building you will see the sign and some cars in the far corner of the parking lot."
1,"After supper at Il Cornelli, we decided to walk off our meal and go down a few blocks to have a gelato here.   Been here many times before, always has great gelato - I like taking half chocolat and have lemon!   with a good espresso!"
1,When we had a broken spring we used ADS. When my door was super slow opening and closing we used ADS. Every time they have come out fast and completed the job efficiently and for a very fair price. They were easy to work with and arrived on time. I have recommended them to many friends because I have was happy with their service. Definitely who I will call the next time I need my garage door fixed.
0,Slowest Starbucks I've been to.... Unfortunate because this one is a convenient location to where I live but the drive through always takes 10-15 minutes whether there's 2 people in line or 12.  People very nice and friendly but not effect enough for how quick Starbucks is elsewhere
0,"Let me first say how excited I was that a taco shop of any variety was opening near my house and place of work.  Staring outside my work window watching them refurbish this location for the past 6 months got me excited for something new.  I have been 4 times and have told myself never again. This last time (9-7-2014), I really mean it. \n\nOrdering is a weird thing. Since each item has to be placed into the computer, individually the process takes forever. There is no number system when you order. Just one item at a time. This adds up when you have five people in front of you.  They give you a pager after you order. One visit, my pager never went off. The employee walked aimlessly around the restaurant trying to locate the person who ordered it. When she finally found us she asked if we would like for them to make it again because it's cold.  Really?  Why did they ask us knowing its cold?  We said yes,  25 seconds later our food was back.  It was apparent they just zapped it in the microwave.   \n\nFood.  Food is okay.  Each time I ordered, it came out slightly warm to cold. The \""crispy\"" tacos shells as they call it, is the same exact thing as the hard taco shells you buy from the grocery store and heat in oven-no flavor, dry and stale. The soft tortillas are also store bought/Taco Bell tortillas.  So really the price you pay is not worth it.  They have two flavors of rice; Mexican and cilantro lime rice.  Both tasted like they were microwaved.  The have Latin fried potatoes that also tasted like they were microwaved which are dry and crunchy.  I also decided to get a side of green sauce .75( I think) for a shot glass size cup.  The same size you pump ketchup in at other fast food places.  I felt totally ripped off. \n\nI hope management reads these reviews.  They need to change the tortillas and hard shells at the very least. With better options nearby, I won't be surprised if they are closed within a year.  \n\nOverall, not worth the price and headache for the wait and stale food.  You're better off spending that money at Garcias down the street, tee pees on Indian school and 40th street or a Filiberto's."
1,This I one of the best and most beautiful hotels and casinos here in Vegas. The architecture and the style is amazing. The Bellagio better look out! The Aria's fountains do rival the water shows at the Bellagio! Absolutely stunning and a well thought out layout make the Aria a true gem!
1,We drive all the way from Summerlin to see movies in style here. \n\nThe Luxury+ seats are comfortable and take the stress out of finding a good seat and getting there early. \n\nThe popcorn quality here is MEH.  The dining options around in The casino is MEH.  (Not at fault to this movie theater - restaurants close at 9PM.)\n\nThe comfortable seats and reserved seating are worth it. Ticket prices are less expensive as well and much appreciated. \n\nThis is the future of movie theaters. The competition should be taking notes.
1,"When there are sales, it is best to get your butt in gear and get to the store. Right now they are having an up to 75% sale. Kenneth Cole and Calvin Klein are some names that gets me motivated. \n\nTwo dress shirts and a light pullover sweater by these big name designers only cost me $42. Everyone loves to save money and look good while doing so. Although Macy's can be expensive, if you are patient, the savings are monumental."
0,Nothing special. Had an omelette and it tasted like something I'd have in a buffet line. Their toast is amazing though as weird as it sounds. Good butter!! May come back to try speciality pancakes!
0,This is the only place to get Schlotzsky's so regardless of the lackluster dining experience  - I will be back.\n\nI love the original.  The warm sourdough type bread with the warm ham... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good. \n\nThis place is old and run down.  The service sucks.  But if you want some Schlotzcky's this is it!
0,"Huge club, lot's of people but it's a very posh pick-up joint. Wear your Rolex (fake, of course), rent/test drive the Porche/SR1/Ferrari and claim it's yours, buy expensive clothes (leave tag on so you can take it back the next day and still make rent), etc.  The people there are very plastic.  The dance floor was so packed that you couldn't move.  I felt like I was in a rush hour train in NY with some chick fingering my back pocket, trying to fish a bill from my wallet (true story - and, by the way, I keep my wallet in my FRONT pocket for that very reason).\n\nThe music was OK but Studio 54 was a lot more fun.  If you're one of those party people who has to have the name TAO on their night-life resume, then great.  I'm more interested in having a good time, having a real conversation and making a real friend that's not based on what you drive, wear or consume.\n\nThe food, however, was great.  Orange Chicken, spicy tuna, num!  I usually eat here at least once every time I come to Vegas."
0,"OK, the restaurant experience is only as good as its weakest link. This lovely little place has great food. However there are two big issues. First, the service has to be good. We got caught in the shift change. Our 1st waiter was fine but our second waitress seemed to care less we were there. Second issue, $2.75 for an ice tea (brewed), and $2 for a refill, give me a break. As sort of icing on the cake, the waitress (yes, the one that didn't really care we were there) simply brought us our check when we finished lunch. We asked her, \""hey don't you guys have pastries here?\"" Never had to ask for desert at a pastry place. \n\nAll in all a nice place to eat but they need to focus on getting the little things right to earn those five stars."
1,"Pick up some great deals on tickets and dinners in Las Vegas!\n\nDue note that during peak hours, the line could take up to an hour. Come early in the AM to find the best seats for the best shows!\n\nDon't get suckered into the \""$25 express line\"" deal. They're basically offering you a 1-year pass to cut the line by paying $25.\n\nIN the summer, the heat kills, so make sure you have sunblock on, shades and a hat!\n\nI'm coming back everytime I need to go see a show!"
1,Absolutely gorgeous place.
0,"Horrible customer service.\n\nOver changed me on my rental. Rented me a scratched, dinged, cracked car and then charge me 50% over the negotiated rate.\n\nIn store customer service was just as bad as the \""800\"" service I forced the in store employee to call."
0,"I'm not going to rate this place for their food because their service was so poor that we decided to leave before we even got our food. \n\nFirst, we walk into the damn place and it smells like wet dog. Literally, wet dog. So I'm thinking to myself \""we came to Vegas to eat at this dump?\"" \n\nSecond, our server comes to my family and my mom is ordering and asking what's good. The server has the god damn audacity to say whatevers on the menu is on the menu just read it.\n\nSo my mom flips a shit and she asks is there something wrong with you? Do you have no patience? Is there somewhere you need to be? And this server knows immediately that he messed with the wrong family. \n\nMy family glares at him, I say. Let's leave. We'll eat somewhere else. And we leave.\n\nSeriously, this restaurants service was so poor, I didn't even bother trying the food. Judging from the looks of it, this place is probably where you'd have you food spat in. If I could, I'd give it 0 stars but I guess this one star is just out of pity."
0,"Can you say, CLOSED! Drove by and it's shut down (as of October 27)."
0,"Went out to try this place out today. Pulled the door handle and the door was locked. Peeked inside, the half of the ceiling lights were on and the tables were in dissaray and without a chair insite. More than likely this place went out of business."
0,"This place is nasty. I got the chicken and broccoli, it had way to much sauce on it and let me tell ya there was a bone in my chicken. I aslo got the teriyaki chicken on a stick and it was gross really salty it was deep fried with some nasty seasoning on it. If I could I would give this place no stars I would. Never eating here again."
1,Great Mexican Food & Service is Amazing.  Also Clean. Loved it that I came 2 days in a row.
1,"Very good food. We are here for dinner. And both of us ordered lamb entree, lamb curry and lamb tandoori. They are fantastic. But I don't like the desserts because they are too sweet for me."
0,"We went for a second time (found out later it was 2 weeks after the chef departed).\n\nSurf and turf roll - tasteless.\nFried rock shrimp - OK\nSent the dessert back, as they may have made the donut part to order, but then filled it with almost frozen yuzu cr\u00e8me.\n\nIt's really a shame, as I like the concept and it's close to where I live... let's hope the next chef whips it back in shape."
1,"Nice outdoor seating, great pizza."
1,"Closed :(\n\nWas a great place to grab a smoke and a drink but west wing appears to have closed down.   The coffee amd hummus were great pairings with the sticks that they had which ranged from ashtons to tatuajes.  Prices were decent as well.  Wish they didnt close,  I really liked coming here."
0,"I was in Scottsdale with a group of women a few weekends ago for vacation and we booked a reservation at Distrito for brunch.  The weather was horrible all weekend so we were really looking forward to Brunch on Sunday before our flights left since the weather was finally nice.  There were 4 of us (all women, mid 30s, corp America Professional, dressed nice).  The moment we sat down our server had an attitude.  The restaurant was busy but nothing too terrible.  He made it very clear from the beginning that he didn't work the morning shift so I'm assuming he was called in last minute.  We were there for over 2 hours ordering foods and pitchers of margaritas and his attitude was so poor to us, that we would take turns for asking for something because he would basically yell at us when we did.  During this time, I saw a few people get up and leave before ordering food as well.  After 2 hours of the mental abuse, we got our bill which was well over 200 dollars, tipped 20 percent, and left.  However, I'm still just extremely upset about this.\n\nHere's the thing; we all have bad days, I understand that.  But that is no excuse to ruin someone else's day because of it.  My girlfriends and I had been planning and looking forward to this trip for several months.  I work very hard as well and this weekend was one of the very few days I've had had off in months.  It was our vacation.  He literally just ruined an enjoyable afternoon for my girlfriends and I for absolutely no reason at all.  Instead of us spending the afternoon catching up because we hadn't seen each other in YEARS, we spent it being scared to order more drinks, coffee, or food because our server was so mean to us.\n\nI just can't believe how horrible this experience was.  I want my vacation day back. =(\nThe only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because their food and drinks are good."
0,"Probably not itching to book at the Mirage again. \n\nThe main issue I had was the room smelled when I checked-in. The source of the smell was from the restroom- it smelled like dirty gym socks that had been placed in a juicer. I called the front desk to get this issue addressed- the phone operator seemed a bit unapologetic about this nuisance. After saying she would have someone look into the issue, an hour had passed and no one had come to the room. I called the front desk again and a different rep had an entirely different tone than the first employee- she apologized for the inconvenience and was able to waive our resort fees. Although the defogging (basically making the room smell good again) meant we had to stay out of the room for two hours, it was worth it (then again, to distract time, we ended up gambling = losing).\n\nThe response time of the TV was painfully slow. Channel surfing was at a crawl. The only other inconvenience of the weekend was the tram connecting Mirage to Treasure Island was down for a brief period and it was when we were needing it on our walk home from a long night out.\n\nA plus of the hotel is that I got a room overlooking the pool and the dolphin exhibit. those dolphins are so smart!"
1,"I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle. What a beautiful performance. The scenery was beautiful, the dancers were great, the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training, overall it was amazing. This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again! Very professional and very entertaining."
0,"Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. \n\nWe decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent."
1,"The best deck in the burgh, for the gay bars anyway. Great bar though, the food has gotten better recently, and the drinks are always good. Its a good time, and a good place to hang out in the community. Very friendly staff and ownership. Who also really supports the community."
1,"There aren't enough words!  Alice's restaurant is THE place to go in Phoenix!  Outstanding food, friendly and helpful wait staff....super d\u00e9cor, decent prices...and it's a wonderful place for kids too.  Not too many of those.  Cooperstown has seen us before and will see us again and again."
1,"I saw Mystere summer of 2005, so I apologize for my review being so late, but I doubt the show has changed much since then.  Regardless if you pay $80-200 a ticket. Mystere is definitely a show worth every single penny. \n   Mystere's stage/theater is not as amazing as O, and the story for Mystere is definitely not up there with Ka.  However, what Mystere lacks in those areas it makes up with amazing acrobatics and gymnastics that Ka and O can't compete with.  Mystere's story (if there is one) is definitely more on the fun, circus-like kooky side of things. But it's  great time.\n  Mystere was my first ever Cirque show in Vegas, but it easily had me hooked.  I highly recommend Mystere for anyone regardless if you've seen another Cirque show or not.\n~G"
0,"I purchased a groupon for this place.  I realized I was able to make an appointment with them online (or, request for an appointment) for a massage through their website as soon as I purchased the groupon.  I called them today confirming my appointment for this afternoon since I didn't receive a confirmation call or anything from them and the lady on the other end of the line told me they're all booked and won't be able to see me (even though their schedule posted online says differently).  She then proceeded to ask how I will be paying for my non-existent appointment and I told her I had a groupon.  She told me they won't be honoring it until next month.  I had high hopes for my experience here, unfortunately just the communication before the massage was a not-so-helpful one for me.  I am getting a refund back from groupon and will be spending my money elsewhere."
0,"Stayed here this past weekend for 5 days/4 nights .\n\nFYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax \n\nUpon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!)\n\nNext day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.\n\nUsually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very \"" I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.\n\nIts not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. \n\nTake note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?\n\nRoom was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size.\nHalls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view.\n\nThe entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)"
0,"We went to this club on a Saturday night and I thought this place stunk (not literally); it was not worth the $10 cover charge.  This is not an ideal place to go if your in your mid-late twenties or younger. The crowd was older (lots of cougars) and it seemed kind of touristy. This bar did not represent the Charlotte night club scene well.\n\nI did like the overall atmosphere, different levels, and outdoor deck area."
1,Good first office visit. Seems to be a caring Doc and did NOT try to talk me into surgery.
0,"Stick with any buffet at the Wynn for MUCH better dining for your buck.  \n\nFor lunch, we ordered the onion soup shooters, mac & cheese, oyster shooters, tarte flambe, manchego salad, Alaskan halibut, steak frites and almond panna cotta.  \n\nGreat presentation, decent service, but every dish was terrifically mediocre - I would put it at Cheesecake Factory level dining.  No originality nor artistry, nothing was memorable - I had to go back to the online lunch menu to remember what we'd had."
1,"Great Mediterranean food. The chicken kebabs were juicy and well spiced. Great rice too! Hummus was thin, but tasty. The grape leaves were serves HOT which was surprisingly good."
1,Their Pad Thai is very good as well as many other meals that come in a variety of spicy.  Dinner is very quiet and service is personable and prompt.  They are very nice people and the price is reasonable if not cheap.
0,45 minute wait in line? Really??? Seriously? Ridiculous!!\n\nThere were lots of tables either open or needing to be bussed and that line would have moved a LOT better.
0,"I went on a Sunday afternoon with my son so we could both get our hair cut. There was one Barber that was just finishing up her last client.  We waited about 15 minutes and were never acknowledged by the barber.  Right when her last patron was finished? She called my son up.  Right then, another person came in and she said she told him he was next and that she would hurry with my son.  She never told me she had an appointment coming in and wasted both of our time.   This was the second time in the last month that we tried this barber.  The prior visit, there was two ladies cutting hair, we were next To go and right before we were called up, two people with appointments showed up.  At no time were we told their was a wait either occasion or that they had appointments next.\n\nThis is a Barber as advertised, not a Beauty Salon.  Barbers historically are walk in.  This is not a \""friendly barber\"" as the name indicates. \n\nThe service and communication at this shop I horrible.  Don't waste your time.  Go across the street to Mr. D's or down the street to Anthem Barbers near Smiths.  Way more professional and always have ample staff to cut hair."
0,Went there for my brothers 21st birthday but was a fail once we got there due to the bouncer rejecting our entrance to the fact that we had about 7 males and 3 females (their ratio is 1:1 males:females for entrance) when unfairly he let a group of 4 males in with no question. That logic makes no sense. \n\nVery rude and disrespectful. Have been there a couple of times before but that night was disturbingly unpleasant. No wonder they're getting a bad rep nowadays. \n\nHakkasan or the clubs at the encore were our other choices such as XS and Surrender and are 10x better.
0,"Disappointed in quality of overall meal - the meats and breads were OK.  The pierogies were NOT good, too doughy and greasy."
1,"This is a late review, but I thought I'd do one anyways.\n\nWent here during this past summer (2012) and my boyfriend and I loved it, well I'd say he loved it more than me. We were on vacation in Vegas for a week and we ended up coming here for dinner twice (on our first night there as well as our third).  The wait can be a little long, but totally worth the wait. Living in Hawai'i we have a huge assortment of seafood, but it's pricey. When we saw how much it cost for a pound of king crab legs, we were kind of surprised because it's cheaper, and I'd say, reasonable. \n\nIf you're not into getting your fingernails dirty, then this might not be the place for you, although they do provide you with gloves and a whole roll of paper towels to clean yourself up. Aside from that, I'd give this place 5 stars because I had an awesome experience, both times."
0,"Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here!  The food at this place is absolutely disgusting!  The soup was so salty and tasted like muddy water.  The rib appetizer wasn't even edible!  It was like it had been made a week earlier.  The foil wrap chicken app was some mysterious pieces of chicken stuffed in foil with salt!  Disgusting!  The sweet & sour pork was seriously like chewing on shoe leather! It had no flavor whatsoever....like it had been boiled to death.  The lo-mein wasn't any better.  It was so salty that you couldn't even eat it!  I hadn't been to this place for about 10 years, due to the last experience I had here.  Made a huge mistake thinking it got better after 10 years.  Not even a little bit better!  Save your money!  Panda Express blows this place away!  And I'm not a big fan of that place either....but at least the food is fresh!  I don't know how China Inn even keeps it's doors open!  Very strange cause there is rarely cars there...hmmm."
0,Food is decent to good.  I have gone there three times for take out for my staff and the orders were completely screwed up three times and when I our someone else tried to correct the order they were incompetent or hostile.
0,"If I could give this place a negative rating I would.  First off, they got my reservation wrong.  I asked for a 2 queen suite and they gave me a king.  I didn't find that out till I got to the room.  I confirmed over the phone with the hotel a week in advance that I had a 2 queen suite. All of my itinerary said I had a 2 queen suite including their website. It took 30 mins to get to my room because the layout of the hotel is horribly confusing and the employees have don't have a grasp of the layout either.  I got lost getting back to the lobby to get my new room.  \n\nThe manager was a tool and wasn't helpful at all and he just wanted to argue with me.  He obviously hates his job.  The hotel looks dirty and dilapidated.  The elevators took forever, I have never been in a slower elevator!  It was at least a 5-10min wait  every time you had to use the damn thing.  The only redeeming quality was that the hotel is centrally located on the strip.  \n\nIf you don't care about where you stay, don't mind dirty old run down rooms and you want a cheap room on the strip this is the place to stay.  I wont be coming back!"
0,"By far the worst sushi I have ever had.\n\nIt took the waiter a full ten minutes to notice we were there even though we were in the very front and there was hardly anyone in the place.\nI was excited to get some tasty, tasty sushi but I was sorely disappointed when I got the menu and there were literally six items on the sushi menu. I should have cut my losses right then. \nI ordered a Rainbow Roll and some Yellowtail. The yellowtail was alright but I was disappointed there was no roe. The Rainbow Roll was terrible!!! I'm used to getting at least eight decent sized peices out of a roll and for there to be healthy chunks of albacore inside the roll. Not here. This $16 roll was five peaces and was filled with Krab and enough mayo to clog my arterties.\nI ended up eating most of the rolls because I was hungry but toward the end, I picked the actually fish off the top.\nWhen the waiter returned, he commented that I hadn't finished everything and asked if I was too full. I told him no I wasn't too full, I was just really disappointed in the dish. He laughed and said he would finish my food for me, dropped the check and was never seen again. \nYuck.\n\nHe gets one star for tracking us down when my boyfriend forgot his credit card."
1,"Great place to have a relaxing dinner and enjoy a glass of wine. The outdoor seating is nice, if you don't want to sit in the loud and dark lounge inside. \n\nTheir service is great. We loved their sushi and sashimi, yuummmm. Empanadas, Seared scallops and Pan roasted Chicken were scrumptious."
1,Went with a group of friends a couple months back on a Saturday afternoon. The service was spot-on and the food was delicious.  My friends and I enjoyed our time there out on the patio. Will be back to dine again.
1,Cool atmosphere with rap music playing which is fine by me. Ordered ribs. Ribs are not that big for the duo sides. One had lots of fat so really had one beef rib split among two which actually worked since we were not that hungry but for others might be a concern. Had a Grill n go salad which was tasty and fries which the portion is huge.
0,"DO NOT BOOK ADAM BROOKS AS YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER!! We paid him in full because of a \""special\"" he was running. Our wedding is in 13 weeks, and we still have not heard a word from Adam.

1,"Sitting outside on a pleasant summer Sunday evening, we had one of the best meals anywhere, anytime.  Although the highly touted duck risotto was less than expected, the Lapin de Val was superb in an enchanting rosemary infused cream sauce. Service by Anabel was exemplary.  Finishing off a fine meal was the super tasty, evidently local, strawberries with mascarpone and my wife had a lovely creme brulee, not exactly in the french style, but creamy and delicious nonetheless. An excellent dining experience"
0,"Reluctantly!!! We just ordered pizza and chicken wings from Rosati's, Tempe. The last pizza was HORRIBLE!!! We thought we'd give 1 last try because we had some box tops for half off? We noticed we had a missed call from Rosati's? We thought it was to confirm our order. But it was a rude guy claiming his name was Scott claiming he was the owner and how did we collect 10 box tops?  We told him, \""by buying pizza?\"" He was rude and sounded like a drunk from the hood? Maybe this guy is having money problems or something? Do yourself a favor and AVOID SCOTT and all locations of Rosati's Pizza as this Scott guy was very unprofessional and If he is the owner we suggest he spend his time at AA, trying to make pizza,  and trying to get his customer service up to par from a ZERO! If we could give Rosati's a ZERO STAR we would!"
0,"The other reviews cover auto part installation which may be their speciality.  But I used them to install an Interlock device through Instant Interlock. They damaged my ignition and would not remove the device when it was due. They delayed removal until I was charged late fees even though they were not monitoring the device. They denied the damage but would not even look at the device or vehicle. Just said it was \""not possible\"" although my 2 mechanics disagreed. As a result, I have had to spend hundreds of dollars in illegally charged  fees from Instant Interlock. Not to mention the cost of repairing my vehicle which is yet to be determined. \n\nMuch of the rude, disrespectful and dishonest behavior was on the part of Instant Interlock, but the problems with the device itself and the installation were caused by Streetfighter's. And they lied to us about removing it, didn't show as promised and lied about the fees.\n\nDON'T let these guys installl an interlock on your car. And don't use Instant Interlock either."
1,"Very good fresh food. Little expensive as expected from a place serving healthy fresh food and also vegan options. There was a long wait. We went on a Sunday morning. The juices menu was very tempting :). We ordered pancake, scrambled eggs, and avocado egg sandwitch. Avocado sandwitch was very yummy. Kids were happy with eggs, pancake, and coconut ice cream."

If you've never been and would like the full ikea experience, plan at least 2 hrs to browse the store. And another 30 mins to check out. But it's well worth it!"

0,"What to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon ..... I know let's go to Town Square and watch a movie.... grab a bite to eat. Hence the reason we ended up at Lolita's.\nWe were the only people in there which you would think would mean fast service. Not so much! \nWe ordered a couple of drinks and a couple of appetizer's ..... I don't have anything negative to say about the food other then it was meh! \nWe ordered the taquito's and nacho's..... I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination and I could have made a better meal! \nWe left the establishment less then impressed, probably won't be doing an encore visit."
0,"I never would have picked this. However, I had a dinner to attend with my coworkers and asked my hunny where he wanted me to stop to get him some food on my way home. \n\nPet Peeve #1: The girl never told me my total. After she asked me for my payment, I still had to ask her my total. She told me $16.00 and ran my card. I asked for an itemized receipt and never got one. Oops, too late. Something fishy is what I think.\n\nPet Peeve #2: I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my son. I asked if they put anything extra on it. Was told no. Needless to say, I wound up with onions on my quesadilla. My year and half son was not happy and did not eat it to say the least. The quesadilla was very cheesy, too cheesy almost and was very, very greasy. It oozed with more grease than cheese. Thank goodness my son wouldn't eat it, I am sure it would have gave him an upset tummy.\n\nPet Peeve #3: Too long of a wait in the drive thru. Sure, me being in a rush to get home to get ready for my dinner was making me impatient but when you go through any drive thru you always expect speedy or speedier service. I did not get that.\n\nIn addition to the quesadilla, I ordered a chicken burrito was just okay per the man. And I also ordered a carne asada super nacho. Nothing was super about it and I mean nothing. The meat was tough, chewy and bland. And well I didn't make it past that. No thanks.\n\nAll these 4 and 5 stars have to be some drunk posts or drunk eats because a sober mind would not enjoy these foods."
0,"Anything with the words \""dole whip\"" will catch my attention. Of course, it tastes the BEST in Disneyland. But to hear that there was a place to get them in Vegas.....YOU GOT ME BRO! I seriously love dole whip. It's crazy because just the other day I was talking about how I wished that I could get dole whip somewhere here in Vegas, and then my boyfriend said \""They actually just opened one here!\"" I really didn't know how to contain my excitement and I wasn't sure exactly where it was located, but all I knew was that I. was. excited. \n\nSoo, in my luck, I found a groupon for pineapple park! It's 3 coupons good for $10 each. You can only use one per visit. We had some time today to go check it out in between our classes, so we went! It's located (not a great location, the strip would've done so well with this) in the Boulevard Mall's food court. Wasn't sure what to expect. The menu was big and they had a bunch of options. There was no line and the girl at the counter was very helpful. I decided to get the souvenir cup because every time you use it you'll get 50% off...and I know that I will be back, LOL. I got the pineapple dole whip of course. My boyfriend ordered the mango flavor in a cone. We ordered and it cost about $18, so with my groupon it ended up being $8 (woo hoo!). She also gave us a punch card! Also if you check in, you can get a refill if you buy the souvenir cup which is great cause that's what I bought before I checked in, lol.\n\nAs we go sit down, I noticed that the girl clicked on two groupons instead of one, so it looked like I used two coupons.....but my receipt said she only gave me $10 off. As I was saddened, I had my boyfriend go talk to her. She said she only clicked on one and so she doesn't know why two were taken. She told him that she would \""remember him\"" so hopefully when we go back, we'll be able to use one again, because that's a rip off!!!! After he talked to her about this situation, he grabbed our order and it was a cup of pineapple dole whip. I asked him, \""Didn't you get mango in a waffle cone?\"" And he said yes! So she messed up our order ontop of messing up the groupon. So, that is why I would have to give this 2 stars. I know people make mistakes, but it was very disappointing seeing that there was so much expectation of this place and I was super excited and I felt like my visit wasn't what I expected. So I was walking out of there not as happy as I thought. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the pineapple dole whip was delicious, but that's not the only thing we as customers need to rave about. Hopefully on my next visit I'll be able to edit my review. Until then, dissatisfaction for me (especially when my experience with dole whip is always in Disneyland)."
1,"Came here with the BF on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend.  We made reservations for about 10:30pm and the place still had a nice number of people inside but it wasn't crowded at all.\n\nMy feedback is as follows:\n\nService = service was impeccable and lived up to what you expect giving the reputation of the restaurants.  Our waiter did an excellent job explaining the different cuts of meat.  Our water glasses were never empty and the table was always kept clean.  I got a kick out of the iPad menu and ended up playing it with it more than I needed to. \n\nFood taste/quality = Everything was so delicious!  We ordered:\n\n- Glazed pork belly\n- Bone marrow flan\n- Bone-in rib eye w/extra marrow on top\n- Miso Glazed salmon\n- Creamed spinach w/egg (a little too watery)\n- Crown & Coke\n- Lots of Love martini \n- Kettle One Tonic\n\nTotal with tip = $240.00\n\nThe only complaint that we had about the food was that when we added the additional marrow to the steak, it was too heavy due to the fatty content and texture.  After a few bites, we almost needed to scrape the rest off to work on the steak.\n\nAll-in-all, the place lived up to the expectations.  I have had my fair share of experiences at steakhouses.  While this wasn't the absolute best, it was still very good."
1,"Stopped into this restaurant the other day for late breakfast around 11:00.  Not too busy and we had attentive service.  Nice new modern design and comfortable booths.  It's a convenient area for us so nice to see new dining choices.  I had blueberry pancakes, which were excellent fluffy and very tasty.  Husband had a veggie scramble that looked and tasted great. We will return."
0,Crappy flavorless chili cheese dog for an obnoxious amount of money! 13 dollars for a hotdog!!! Even if it's the size of a hot dog and a half that still doesn't work out in my book. The fries were bland and only temperate. I am not surprised that they didn't have a line when McDonald's and their fast service had one! That was another thing it took 15 minutes to cook 3 dogs?

1,"After searching the many furniture stores in this area I came into Ashley feeling defeated. Looking for a pretty large sectional, without a large budget, was starting to feel like an impossible mission. \n\nI walked in and was immediately greeted by Carl. Like I said, I had already spent the better part of my day looking at furniture and at this point I just wanted to be done with it. I told him what I was looking for and he directed me to those which met my criteria. \n\nI ended up picking the first one I saw and got it for a great price (even got them to discount it lower than the sticker price!). Checkout process was easy even though their computer system was down. \n\nOne piece of the sectional wasn't in stock so delivery was delayed by about a week but for the price I was  willing to wait! \n\nFinally, my sectional was delivered. I love the piece itself, though the delivery people were just so-so. Not great (didn't even hook the pieces of my sectional together) and not bad, just so-so. \n\nNext time I am looking for furniture (which I hope isn't for a LONG time), I'll def start here vs. making it my last stop."
0,"I had a DUI a few years ago and based on this law office's great \""client testimonials\"" they could get out of my situation.  8 months later and $5,000.00 lighter in the pocket i was being told by my attorney \""Here, sign this. Your getting 10 days in tent city, paying $4,800 in fines, getting the ignition interlock, and have to take DUI classes.\""\n\nThis law office didn't do anything for me despite having 100% positive reviews on their website.  \n\nWell, i guess its true, never trust an attorney...."
1,"It was my first time coming to this place today. Came during my lunch hour, I was surprised it wasnt full of people! Service was good, very nice cashier upfront (I believe her name was Jamie). I ordered the original double cheese n fries. Omgggg! It was delicious! I saw the burger and thought I wouldnt get full lol but its actually the perfect size. I wasnt over stuffed when done and was very satisfying. The burger was a little greasy but sooooooo delicious! The fries... I wasnt a big fan; dont get me wrong, they are good but they are really thin so they are a little on the crispier side. Im not a fan of crispy foods. I would highly recommend this place!"
0,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Great happy hour prices, and the food is less than mediocre. Waitresses are not friendly and you wait, and wait, and wait for her to come back and ask if you'd like another drink. And then you wait, and wait, and wait for your drink. This is from three separate visits, and friends say the same. Atmosphere is great, patio is very cool. Did I mention how much the service SUCKS?"
0,"I am trying to come up with some positive feedback for this place. Sadly, the only thing that comes to mind is that I didn't get shot while there. If you are interested in looking at booths with garage sales items marked up to department store prices, come here! \n\n99% of the items appears to be from the 90s. Old Avon booths, faded garments and outdated \""As Seen on TV\"" items were the most popular booths. \n\n1% of the items appeared to be handmade, which earned them one star for effort. Personally, I would buy a cake at a swap meet or nuts from old bins but someone who is less of a germ-a-phobe may. I must admit, they have the most pathetic looking \""Farmers Market\"" I have ever seen. They had brussel sprouts in the same condition and packaging as the 99 Cent Only store that I saw the previous day, the \""farmer\"" marked them at $2.50. I thought about it in my head and my friend who was with me both days brought it up that she bet that the guy stopped at the 99 Cent store to stock up. \n\nThe layout of the place is confusing at best and be prepared for aggressive sales people trying to sell you a scarf as \""handmade by the seller\"" with a made in china tag. \n\nIt is a $1 admission to get in. Save your buck."
1,Great gardens!  I honestly can't wait until I go again.  The rooms are divided by climate and location.  They have a great bonzai and orchid collection.  Make sure you check out the butterfly room!
0,"Although nothing major went wrong with my massage, it was certainly not at all relaxing or what I had expected.\nI write this review in attempt to help those who are considering Tranquil Massage for the first time, as well as the business owner or manager. I understand not everyone can afford to get a massage at a high-end spa, but I think whomever considers a massage here needs to have clear expectations.\nI booked my appointment online, requested a female therapist, and even selected my appointment time based on a \""Renee\"" who would be my therapist. Upon arrival to the building, my first thought was, 'maybe I should just go home.' Not exactly what you want to feel when you are about to be half naked with a stranger. I had been given the massage as a gift from a relative, so I thought I may as well walk-in to see what this place was all about - you know, 'never judge a book by its cover.' Upon walking in the building, I nearly bumped into a male (at the time didn't realize that he was a therapist), who just asked, \""Are you here for a massage?\"" I replied yes, and he turned around (was he getting ready to leave?) and lead me into a cold waiting area - no frills, clean, but uncomfortable, smelled kinda funky. He never told me his name, or asked for my name, confirming that I had an appointment. He asked me to fill out a medical form. While I filled it out, I heard another male voice arguing with someone on the telephone.  At this point, I was thinking, 'where is Renee?', and thought maybe he was just getting me all set while she finished up another client or something. I had to use the restroom before we started, and while in there, I thought, 'maybe I should just walk out.' But, again tried to talk myself through it, thinking that I shouldn't be so judgemental, and that I'm sure everything was fine. So I went back. He walked me into a less-than-impressive massage room - again, cold, terrible lighting, and scantily furnished. He started to review my form with me, as I thought, 'is he the one doing my massage? should i tell him I requested a female?' For some reason, I didn't say anything. I guess still hopeful that it wasn't him that would be giving me a massage. UNTIL, he said he would wait outside while I undressed to my comfort level. (1st rule of spa business, if a client requests a female, don't ignore the request. If only a male is available, call the client to confirm it is OK.)  I thought, 'well I guess this is it...'  He came back and began my massage. He was nice enough, and seemed to ask the right questions, however the massage was mediocre at best. The whole time I kept thinking about how uncomfortable I was, the lights were left on bright - which I guess was good so that I didnt feel that I was in a dark room with a strange man, but also a terrible practice for a spa, the music was too loud, I could hear cars driving by outside the window, a cricket was chirping throughout, and even the way the therapist rubbed lotion in his hands bothered me. My mind was buzzing so much with all the things that seemed wrong, or made me uncomfortable, in the end, I just couldn't wait to go home. I wished that I had just left the multiple times I thought about it when I first arrived.\nBased on the other Yelp reviews on the therapists that ARE actually listed on the company website, they sound legit. However, for whomever owns this business, and any potential future clients, you need to be aware of how terrible my expereince was. There are many lessons that should be taken from my review, and I hope, for the sake of the business and others who may encounter what I did, that the persons in charge of this company's image spend less time worrying about getting \""likes\"" on Facebook and producing marketing materials, until they have the basics down."
1,"Three words, three cup chicken. So great! I love the cucumber tomato side. \n\nAll the pizzas are also delicious are reasonably priced. \n\nThe High Tea is also good, but kind of pricey"
0,"I've been meaning to review our experience for a couple of months and here it is. \n\nWe bought a TravelZoo Local Deal for the $25 Theater-Style Teppanyaki or Sushi Dinner for 2 at Kobe (Chandler, AZ). It was plain awful. They completely bait and switched on us and treated us like second rate customers. \n\nWhat began as either sushi or teppanyaki to the tune of $75 (we opted for sushi) turned into a fixe prix three course menu with extremely limited choices, none of which added up to the said dollar value. Not only that, but they sanctioned off a separate room for travelzoo local deal diners. A dirty room with no music, a new waitress-in-training who didn't speak english, a supervising waiter who apologized for the obvious bait and switch, stating the owners wanted to make it \""simpler and more organized\"" when clearly they were trying to save a dime.  After we showed our surprise to the unexpected change, we had very little attention or service for the rest of the night. We had to basically beg to get the bill so we could leave. The food honestly wasn't even good, some was just plain inedible. \n\nIt was a depressing experience and I suggested that travelzoo never partner with that particular restaurant again. I also suggest that you find another more palatable place to dine. Plenty of other choices in town, no need to see for yourself here."
1,"My husband and I decided to give this place a try even though it was a little far from our house and we were glad we did! The food was great and it's not expensive at all! I don't know who would call this restaurant overpriced, it's cheaper than Olive Garden and the food is waaaay better. \n\nWe got Chicken 65 for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised. It was a good amount of food for an appetizer and the chicken was really yummy, spicy but with lots of flavor. Then, I got Korma chicken and asked them if they could combine chicken with the vegetarian option (I really wanted veggies in my dinner that night:) and they did, no problem. I thought it was pretty good, could've been a little more flavorful but now I'm just being picky. My husband got Lamb Rogan Josh which he said was really good, the lamb was tender and the whole dish was delicious. We also got an order of cheese stuffed Naan bread which came out hot and very tasty. \n\nThe service was very quick, our waitress was polite and accommodating, no complaints there. We'll definitely be back, even though it's a little bit out of our way, we had great dining experience there!"
1,"Our server Todd was very knowledgeable about the food. We started with the Spinach and Crawfish Dip which fantastic but super filling. Best to eat that with some  friends.  I had the Crescent City Pasta and it may be my new favorite pasta dish. Brad had the Crawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e which he loved. It has a great roux to start with, and the flavors were good with a little heat behind it. Another very filling dish. Overall a great experience and we will be back.  FYI  no hats allowed."
0,"First of all, the location of the restaurant is at the north tip of the Fashion Show Mall.  What exactly is the Fashion Show Mall?  It is a bunch of chain stores and tacky shops thrown together in a flying saucer looking building.  Nothing about the place says Fashion, Show, or Mall.\n\nBut anyway...Stripburger.  Right across from Wynn...or Encore...whichever one that is.  Sit outside and you can see Trump Casino in the distance.  Horrible service but the food was decent.  It is relatively cheap.  Good news is usually the service is so horrific that you will not feel bad about not leaving a tip.  So...cheap food and no tip should be in your budget. \n\nHere is a tip though...it is not a good place to get drunk because it is at a major intersection.  If you get hit there will be nothing but a blood and margarita mixed smear on the ground with an imprint of Penn & Teller advertising."
1,"Stopped in after chiropractor appt int he same complex.  They lost my order and never made my sandwich, the owner noticed and took great care of me, including giving me an already filled out punch card for next visit.  \nI got a double meat Pastrami sub for $9, BEST. SUB. EVER!  \nShop is very clean and staff friendly.  I'll be back!"
0,"We came here for dinner before heading to a show at the Rhythm Room. I LOVE Vietnamese cuisine and will never pass up a chance to have some! Unfortunately I wish I had this time. \n\nI ordered the chicken curry dish. It was the most disappointing curry I've ever had (I love curry and was really excited for this). It was thing, watery, and bland. Very little spice or flavors. Only had half a potato and a few onions, and the chicken - oh god the chicken. It was a whole chicken, including skin, which had been chopped up and thrown into the curry. I tried picking off meat from the little bones, but I came up with little edible chicken. About 1/3 way through the dish I had to stop eating because every other bite resulted in little chicken bone fragments. Gross. \n\nMy boyfriend got the pho with shrimp and extra veggies. Quite bland as well, and the only veggies that came with it was broccoli. Really? At other Vietnamese restaurants you get tons of different veggies! \n\nWe both ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee and it was incredible. But it wasn't good enough to make up for the food. :( I'm always sad to have subpar Vietnamese food."
0,I am mad that ha had to give this place even 1 star. See the old reviews were pretty good then the newer reviews are mostly bad. This place changed ownership and the new management is rude. The food isnt the same. Its very bad actually. I used to call in and order take out when I was in town about 2-3 times per week. I called right after they changed hands. The woman on the phone said she didnt know what I was talking about and hung up on me. I was confused. I went there and figured there was a miscommunication but it was all new staff. I ordered any way. The food was different. I was treated like I was not welcome. I thought I would complain to the new owner. I was dealing with the new owner all along! DONT GO HERE. Their food isnt fit for dogs and they have such bad attitudes.
1,"i have never been in a hampton inn this nice!  it felt like a much higher end hotel - also cost more than the typical hampton inn.  i had a 1st floor room, private patio with table and chairs, beautiful room.  the neighborhood is nice, can walk and shop and explore - upscale shops and lots of nice places to dine.\nonly criticism is the fitness facility which was lame - 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 bench, dumbbells to 50 lbs.  no place to do situps, no yoga type mats, small and crowded room without a clock on the wall!"
0,"Stopped in and it always feels like the staff, no matter which one I go to, is always miserable.  There are no recommendations/suggestions and it's not an experience rather someone takes your order, you move five feet and pick up your product.  Kind of robotic.  In a day where people want a pleasant person helping, this is not the place."
1,I love the food here.  We went with a group for lunch and had Jeremiah as a server.  He was funny and a great server.  The lettuce wraps are mouth watering and the candied shrimp were amazing delicious!  \nI've never had a bad experience here.
1,"Tried the Sweet and Spicy meatball sub and it was DELICIOUS!!! I like the decorum in the place and they even brought my order to me instead of calling out my name (very nice). The menu looks tremendous, definitely going back for more."
0,Went to naked fish happy hour. Really bad bad service and they charge mandatory $5 gratuity. Not worth the food. Never will go back. And bad service and had to pay the tips.
0,"I don't know where all these good reviews are coming from,  but my experience at Dr Tony Peters was much less that stellar.  I used a living social I bought for a massage.  This was the worst massage I have ever had-- days later my back was still soar.   I felt like I couldn't even stand I was in so much pain.  Plus,  the music is booming outside of the massage room.  You can't really relax when you constantly hear the bass rhythm in the background.\n\nLastly,  the place is just sketchy.  It is in a weird area,  the place isn't really designed/ set up like a chiropracter's office AND there was a 311 poster of the ceiling.\n\nMy overall reccomendation,  just go somewhere else.  Go somewhere else for your massage and for your chiropractic needs."
1,"I walked in guessing this would be a terrific burger, and I wasn't disappointed. Paul, my server, was quick, knowledgable, and kind. He suggested an awesome cocktail (skinny screw) that I had to restrain myself from drinking immediately. Ordered the Blue Burger with arugula- fabulous! It was simple, but every ingredient was fresh and delicious. Perfect amount of blue cheese and I love the buns they use. Great value for the $$."
1,"So delicious! I've been twice now. Once with a couple of moms and our babies/toddlers. It was kid friendly - they have a few kid's options (which my picky eater ate happily) & a changing table. A note though, they only have 2 high chairs. This doesn't make the place better or worse - I just found it to be helpful info since I was with kids. I liked it so much I took my mom for mother's day. She loved it too, which isn't an easy feat. ;) I've had the build your own omlette, the french toast, a mocha & french macaroons. EVERYTHING was yummy. It's 4 instead of 5 because of the service. The girls were nice, but not super with it. ;) (i know that's mean, sorry, it's just true)"
0,"I USE to love 1130 when the service and managers were courteous and nice. The last trip to 1130 we double dated with new comers because we raved about the food and the service. We have been here at least a half dozen times and ordered the salmon, calamari, steak salad, mimosas, happy hour beers/cocktails, burgers. All great until this past trip. We go here so often I have bought gift certificates through restaurants.com that is $25 off a $50 bill of ALCOHOL+FOOD. So using this certificate was no problem the first time we went; the waiter checked with her manager before we even ordered to make sure it was alcohol+food. Both said it was valid. So I bring in another certificate a month later, and it's a whole new story when the bill comes. This waitress tells us we are not allowed to use it for our drinks, only food. Contradicting themselves from the month previous we used it. Then the manager comes over and I explain to her the situation and they honored our certificate the month before no questions asked, but she insisted in arguing with me for about ten minutes asking who the manager was, whats their name and waitress' name who \""approved\"" this the last time.  After fighting with the he-she, she said she will honor it this time but not the next time with a bad attitude and stormed off. \n\nI have worked years in the food industry and you NEVER argue for any amount of time with the customer. ESPECIALLY if you honored the certificate then change your tune the next visit. I was humiliated in front of our friends we invited out and appalled that the manager had the balls to argue with me for ten minutes. I have another certificate for 1130 and WILL BE THROWING IT OUT, WE WILL NOT BE BACK and told all our friends/family what happened. That is not how you conduct your business if you want to keep customers happy and spreading your praise!  \n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT."
1,"What a great little find! Tuck Shop has been on my radar for awhile because of Yelp, so when a friend suggested trying it, I jumped at the chance. \n\nFirst of all, I really liked the atmosphere. There was nothing particularly outstanding about it, but it just had a cool and cozy vibe. The service was awesome - we had a really nice waiter and a couple other people checking on us through out the night. \n\nThe menu is designed for sharing - which I love to do, so my friend and I ordered a several dishes. We each had a salad. I had the Chicory Salad (hazelnuts, roasted squash, endive, and desert honey-chestnut buttermilk). It's not that often that I go crazy about a salad, but this one was exceptionally delicious. I loved the roasted squash and the dressing had a very slight spicy undertone (cayenne?) that was so good. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. My friend had the Baby Lettuce Salad (avocado, fennel, orange-pomegranate vinaigrette) which was very good, but she was jealous of mine. \n\nWe shared the finger sandwiches (brie, honey, walnuts); fries and gravy (parsnips & potatoes with melted gruyere and a mushroom gravy dipping sauce); the mac and cheese. All were good, but I'd probably only order the mac and cheese again.\n\nAll this with a glass of wine made for a pretty great meal. I'm excited to go back!"
0,"I've been to Max's about 10 times, 8 of them being before they even opened up. It's located in the old Lone Star Steakhouse standing alone between an Albertson's and Chevron. You can't miss it.\n\nThe interior is very nice, certainly nicer than any Filipino restaurant I've been too. It's fancy like Vegas but not so cause there's no go go dancers. There's lots of seating and a bar.\n\nI did some research before coming and noticed Max's is known for their fried chicken and halo halo. I had the whole fried chicken dinner with two sides, some slaw and fries. The chicken was kind of disappointing. It wasn't meaty, juicy, or crispy. It was tiny for the price but had some good flavors, potential to being good. The slaw and fries were basic nothing special. I'll try the chicken again just cause it's what they're banking on plus it was their 1st day.\n\nThe halo halo was good then again can you really screws up halo halo. For those who haven't had halo halo it's a cold dessert made up of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various beans, fruits, and fruit preserves. Sometimes there's ube ice cream which Max's does.\n\nThey serve other Filipino food at pretty reasonable prices. The customer service is very friendly. Let them make their \""special sauce\"" they get a kick of making it for you. I think it was nothing but banana ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and something else, it was alright. I'd probably come back."
1,"yeah, I'll throw my 2 cents in...\nI was here on a Saturday evening around 7 pm and it was PACKED. 40 minute wait for a table for 2, not terrible but I should have made reservations.\nGot right up to the bar and after glancing at a line of drafts 30 foot long, I ordered something I was familiar with because there was no way I was going to try and look at each one and look like a complete tool...anyway the bar service was fast.\nWe ended up getting sat outside, which we didn't ask for but hey, I was starving so we sat, ordered and food got there in decent time. I ordered the beef dip and is was phenomenal. I got the salad instead of fries and it was actually pretty good. I was expecting iceburg lettuce with an under ripe cherry tomato but it was much better than that.\nAll in all, I'd go back just to sample the beer and grab that beef dip again. I take a star off because it felt too touristy for me...I'm more of a locals only dude"
0,"Womp womp womp. This place is a such a downer - I have no idea why people come here and why it is so, so packed all the time. It must be their awesome discounts for people in the industry. I am not a casino worker and I am not down with paying $12 for a teeny watered down beverage.\n\nI have come to BM a few times before my last trip for my friend's birthday party and I have never been impressed. As many others here have pointed out - the place is for cooooougars and men who wish to prowl on divorcees. Other people you may find here - groups of girls who come for happy hour and leave before being hit on by sleez-os trying to dance up on them on the tiny dance floor. Lots of single dudes. Single dudes standing around in a martini bar.... \n\nAnyway - my friend had her birthday here on \""Latin Night\"". We wanted a table in the back, but didn't get one because they said they weren't going to open the bar in the back. So, my friend - pissed by the way - agreed to be sat up toward the front, in much less nice seating. They shoved our 10 person party in space meant for about six and promised us we could have the table next to us as soon as the two cradle robbers at that table left. Right. *rolls eyes* I've been to a lot of clubs/bars in Vegas and I've been around a lot of promoters and I even did a stint of promoting myself. That right there is just crap service. Especially to locals.\n\nLet me also point out the fact that our waitress never came by to fill our drinks. I get it, it's busy, whatever. There was a table full frat-hats next to us, whom she was serving, but come on. You can't even come around once after the first time to refill drinks? I've been in PACKED clubs and I've had my drink refilled by the waitress many, many times during the course of a night.\n\nSorry, maybe call me spoiled by my desire to actually have bottle service when you're paying for BOTTLE SERVICE. If you're going to offer the option, and people are going to pay for the bottles - then step it up and do it.\n\nOverall - I never have any intentions of returning to BM, unless I'm invited to another birthday party."
0,"I ordered Fire Department shirts for a department here in the valley. I ordered these shirts a month or so before I needed them. They have me a date that I could pick them up a week prior to the date I needed them. When I showed up on the date they were said to be finished they said they were busy and I'd have to come back in three days. I was on shift that day so I came in the following day. Guess what, they're still not finished and I'm here writing this post as I wait. I'm giving them two stars just because I'll have them by the time I need them."
1,"While I've never been disappointed by any Rubio's location, this is by far my favorite.  The staff here is amazing.  They provide exceptional service and are always very helpful with any questions I may have.  The food is always good.  Perfect size portions (not too small or too big), great variety, and a great salsa bar. \n\nIf you are looking for a good place to eat at a reasonable price, this is the place to go."

1,"What a wonderful place to eat.  I have eaten here many times and I always come back for more.  The food and drinks are a lil bit on the pricier side but what do you expect from a restaurant inside the MGM.  \nI had the cochinita Pebil, if you don't know what it is,  watch \""Once Upon a Time in Mexico\"", it's the plate that Johnny Depp's character orders every time he eats.  Anyways the Pebil wa fantatstic,   the pork was soft and tender, it practically melted in my mouth.  \n\nMy G/F had a the steak taco's, which were really good,  what I like about this place is that the put your taco stuff on a plate and you pretty much make your own taco's.  Its good for picky eaters like my G/F.\n\nProbably my favorite thing here is the Guacamole,  it's made right at your table and it is soo fresh and the taste is fantastic.   Also the chips and 3 different types of salsa make waiting for your food not a problem."
0,"I met eric and was not impressed with his insulting comments regarding me purchasing a platinum ring. Which my finance already has. He seemed to attempt to make me,regret for buying a metal 3 times the worth and more rare than gold. \nHe said I will regret buying this ring and everyone regrets platinum. Knowing I had already purchased it and more competitive than he could ever match. He's a typical shyster \nI walked out of his store regretting something I worked so hard to purchase for my future wife. \nThe purest metal he compares to a painted metal."
0,"My food was extremely greasy, even the paper it was wrapped in . I got a combo they forgot my salad had to go back and get it , my sandwich wasn't good and neither were the other peoples sandwiches that were on our order. The chicken cutlet sandwich was extremely dry , even trying to put mayo on it didn't help the taste . My salad wasn't good either , it was covered in onions . I will not be coming back here the only thing that was  good was the prickly pear lemonade. Plus this was our first time here , price was a little high also.  Staff was nice though ."

1,"If you want something a little different, or just something you recognize, go to Cheeburger Cheeburger. \n\nI have been there a few times, and I love it. it is your average 50's motif burger joint, with a twist. There are 5 different sizes from the Classic at 5.5 ounces to the Pounder at a whopping 20 ounces before cooking. Now you get to choose your Cheese from a choice of 8 cheeses (there are no hamburgers on the menu, however the cook will gladly forgo the cheese if you want). That is only the beginning, you can choose between 29 different toppings and just for a little more you can add another 5 toppings. I am not sure how many different combinations you can make; however, the fun is experimenting to see just what you can come up with and try as many different combinations as you can. When you finish the Pounder, you get your picture taken and placed on the wall, or in a little book they will show you of different people who came with a Cheeburger Cheeburger appetite.\n\nAnd that is just the beginning. You need to experience Cheeburger Cheeburger on your own. So when you are in Las Vegas just follow Rainbow Blvd south, and it will be on your left, you have to look out for it, because you can miss it (and that would be a sad experience).\n\nI forgot to mention Milkshakes and Malts, there are 378,000 different combinations, I think I want to try them all."
0,"Puts the \""Rip\"" in ripoff!!!\n\n        Went to Skybox in May 2011 with my wife and daughter.  I ordered an 8 oz hamburger, my wife had a salad and my daughter had the macaroni and cheese.  We also split an order of nachos.  It was quite a shock when the bill for this came to $85 with tip!!  The $18 burger is 1/2lb and comes with no sides at all!! Only a pickle slice, no fries.  Each soft drink is 4.50/each.  Clearly an overpriced tourist trap.   After leaving hungry, we wound up stopping in McDonald's on the way home disgusted by the knowledge we had spent that much money on basic unfilling food.  Do yourself a favor a go to a real restaurant where $85 buys more than a burger, salad and mac and cheese.  Shame on you Aria for ripping the public off this way!!!"
1,Stop by for a late lunch or early dinner and hit the happy hour food. You do get a slightly smaller order than normal but at half price its still a good deal. Had the boneless wings and its always good. \nI had the Southwest Chicken Pasta and it does not disappoint. Lots of chicken to go around. Probably the best thing I have had on the menu.
1,"They changed from 'resort' to hotel no matter what the name is the is a nice place to stay. The rooms are top notch, I've never had a bad meal in the gallery restaurant. There are several bars on the property one right off the main lobby which has a balcony overlooking the 18th green. The other bar has a nice feel with a big screen to watch a game, etc. \n\nThey added a new pool last year which makes the property more attractive. I've never used the spa so I really do not know much about it. \n\nI ha e played the course and used the range. It is playable for the average golfer but the width of the fairways is gonna be a challenge if you can not keep it at least a little straight. The greens are somewhat forgiving but in the middle of the summer they get fast.\n\nI think they have a golf school there but not sure. The pro shop has all you need high end. They have club rental also."
0,"Was able to get in and out, but something about this store doesn't quite add up.  Maybe it's the close calls by cars zipping through the parking lot, or how the store is so far into the WhiteHall complex (feels like you are driving forever once you turn off of S.Tryon).\n\nWalmart is what it is... some locations slightly better than others... this is on the other end in my book.  Luckily I only have to go here once in a while.  It does serve a good place to kill time if you are waiting for someone to arrive at the airport."
0,"Places like this have almost permanently done me in for going any place that is Fancy (capital F).\n\nWe had a party of 8 to celebrate a birthday, so we were ready to go all out.\n\nWe had 2 servers, which not sure if this was a common practice - but we certainly did not get twice the service.  \n\nThere was a great deal of pomp surrounding ordering and napkins, etc...but some basics fell apart.  We had to beg for an extra napkin, when they cleared plates for salads/apps - we had to ask several times for replacement forks/knives with our entrees. Getting refills on drinks was also a challenge.  \n\nFor the entrees, we all ordered some version of steak.  And they were wildly inconsistent in their done-ness.  Medium rare looked completely different on 3 different plates.  We did send one back (a rarity among my friends) that was way over done.\n\nAll that being said, my steak was good (ordered medium). The sides were pretty good - standard stuff for a steak house....asparagus, potatoes gratin, sauteed mushrooms, fries.\n\nBut, for the cost it was not worth it.  Fine for a work dinner or if you're in town for a game and don't want to leave the north shore (snooze).  Otherwise, unlikely that I'll be spending anymore of my money there."
1,"I could eat subs for lunch every single day and never tire of subs.  Usually I go to subway because of location and price, but when I want a real treat I order Mr Goodcents.  I order the same thing every single time and consistently it is delicious.  The delivery driver is so professional and she is a sweetheart.  When I am feeling extra crazy I order chocolate chip giant cookie.  All very delicious!! Not the cheapest but definitely worth it!!"
0,"Not too impressed, ordered the hot roast beef sandwich and received a cold sandwich I could make at home. Had two bites and couldn't eat the rest... Just gross..."
0,"EAT A BUG!!!  Ordered the pho tan beef soup and the lettuces/mint sprigs that come with it had big dead bugs on them -- don't they even wash their produce?  Now I wonder how many bugs are in everything else they serve?\n\nService was non-existent, no eye contact either.  Very busy, but I don't know why.  Workers running around like chickens with their heads cut off - maybe they have more business than they can handle well.  IOW, they don't have time to clean the place or wash their produce.\n\nEggrolls super greasy - ick!"
0,"Went here with several associates at work.  I was not impressed at all.\n\nIf I had to just rate the food, I would rate this a solid 4 Stars.  I ordered the Romaine Salad and a Braised Short Rib.  Well, they brought out the wrong salad.  Instead, I had a cottage cheese type of salad.  However, I have to say that the Braised Short Rib was EXCELLENT.  Let me say that again, the RIBS were EXCELLENT.  Just of note, Salad was $12, Ribs was $39 bucks, $10 for asparagas (?!!), and wine was another thing!  Ouch.\n\nNow, why I gave it a 2 stars.  For a fine dining restaurant, it was not an intimate nor refine setting.  Rather, it felt like a rock concert where the guests are SQUEEZED into as many tables as possible.  The seats were soo uncomfortable.  Shoot... we felt like sardines crunched into our dining seat.  To put this into perspective, imagine the table next to you, you would be literally be 2-3 inches away from their elbow.  \n\nForget holding a conversation.  Many times, I just ended up yelling and screaming to try to communicate.  No wonder my waiter got my order wrong.  He could not hear me.   \n\nOverall, it was a bad experience.  Food was good, service was average, environment was the pits.  For a fine dining experience where it is over $100 a person to dine (meal and wine), nah, I look for something better.  \n\nPass...."
0,I was very disappointed with my stylist. I had gone in with very light blonde hair and when I left it was at least 3 shades darker. \nI went in to get highlights done with some dark brown chunks. She ended up weaving the blonde and brown in my hair. So it came out darker looking. \n\nThen a few days later I went back to get hot pink put in and she still didn't listen to what I had told her. I told her where I wanted the peekaboo's placed and she just did whatever she wanted. \n\nI will never go back.
0,"Sorry I just can't recommend this place at all. I actually make a trip and take my car out to a place in Peoria off Lake Pleasant and Deer Valley. This place has poor customer service and just can't take \""no\"" for an answer. And after the hassle and haggle and still \""no I don't want your ppl touching my tiny chip in my windshield\"" they do a crap job on the wash. In addition they refuse to take my car through the wash and force me to pay extra for a handwash. Come on its a stock Camry. Its not \""too low\"". My car is fine going through any other auto spa."
1,"Pretty good dim sum place just a little off the strip.  Large enough room that we didn't have any problem seating around 10 people pretty quickly.  Food came quick too and there is plenty or various dishes to choose from.  I highly recommend the crispy fried calamari, which has the legs... i love the legs!  I very much enjoyed everything I tried here.  Will definitely like to come back next time I'm in Vegas."
1,"One of the most iconic and beautiful attractions in Vegas, and it's free! It plays regularly 2-4 times per hour. The fountains are choreographed to music, and the show changes periodically. It's great for kids and adults alike. It's right on the street, so if you're passing by, you can catch a showing.\n\nMonday - Friday\n3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.\nshow every 1/2 hour\n7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.\nshow every 15 minutes\nSaturdays, Sundays and Holidays\n12:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.\nshow every 1/2 hour\n7:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.\nshow every 15 minutes\n\nLike other reviewers have said, it's great at night with the lights...but on this occasion, I just loved it in the afternoon. It was a beautiful spring/summer afternoon with the sun shining, the lake sparkling like diamonds, and Andrea Bocelli singing \""Time To Say Goodbye\"". With the gorgeous lake, the Mediterranean architecture and the cypress trees, it felt like hanging out in Italy on a warm afternoon.\n\nThis is a must see in Las Vegas, don't miss it!"
0,We ordered very basic fried rice dishes. They're reasonably priced but very very bland. I'll give them another shot with other menu items but with the fail of this simple dish I won't know what to expect.
1,"A trip to the Omnimax Theater is always a good time and I have never left disappointed.  The theater is massive the screen is something like 5 times that of a regular movie screen it's way bigger then the IMAX. \n\nDid you know that ever Christmas season the Omnimax screens Polar Express! I mean guys you really feel like you're riding on the train!  Seeing the Polar Express annually has become something of a family tradition for me and the little ones. \n\nAnd how cool was it that Batman the Dark Knight Raises was also screened here? The massive screen  added a layer of epic to the film viewing experience that in no way could be matched by any other theater around town. \n\nTickets for movies at the Omnimax can be purchased separately from the general admission pass to the museum.  I recall ticket prices for shows being any where for $9-$12.00. \n\nBonus it's all set up like a movie theater and is accompanied by a concession stand that serves ICEEs.  I would not suggest it for very little kids under 5 , the sound is very loud and can prove to be frightening and over whelming. I learned this the hard way."
0,"Took pizza back because crust was over cooked and had a bitter taste. Management had such an unprofessional attitude ... it was incredulous!\nThe manager loudly shouted at me ... \""other customers like the pizza the way it is...\"" Those other customers stood by smiling. I said ... \""then let them eat your pizza.\"" After going on and on about how the pizza was good etc.            I said that was his opinion and mine differed. I also said that I would not be back ... and the manager said \""Don't come back.\"" On that we did agree.\nPoor food ...and even worse customer service."
1,"Everything here was good. We had the waffles, chocolate covered strawberries, beignets with jam and took home some strawberry pie, and chocolate chip cookie. We washed it all down with caramel iced coffee and it was all delicious! Clean restaurant, nice decor, better than anything I could find on the strip. Perfect!"
1,Always a great place! Remember going as a child at the original location on Woodlawn! This place is great always has been. Quality service and quality food. The chicken tenders are hand breaded and have been my favorite since a small child! The honey mustard is delish! For a more grown up taste ;) try the pizzas or pimento cheese! Yum!
1,"Made my first trip to Bojangles while visiting Charlotte this past weekend... I LOVE biscuits and this was clearly the place to go for that! I ordered some chicken, mac & cheese, a plain biscuit, and 2 cinnamon biscuits... the best part of the meal was clearly the biscuits... other food was just ok.  I love these biscuits, especially those heavenly cinnamon biscuits!"
0,I was treated very rude by the owners and will tell anyone I cross paths with not to patron this establishment.  They think they can treat customers rudely without getting a reputation.  I watched them kick out a mother and her children because she had a barking dog in her Bentley outside.   O.K. I am that mother. The nerve!

1,"Beer Pong center of the universe! Plus live music, cheap drinks, low table bets and fun crowd make this a must-visit on center of the Strip."
0,"The place is beautiful and well thought out.  It's too bad the menu sucks.  The drinks are a measured shot.  Had the poorest vodka on the rocks in the valley.  A measured shot for $11.00.? VERY limited menu items that included three sandwiches...four pasta dishes...and a few different salads.  Each item was more of an appetizer than a meal.  The pasta serving was the equivalent of a side order elsewhere.  The pizza's were more of a starter and NOT a meal.\n\nFor as sharp as the Grayhawk people seem to be...they have totally blown Isabella's for me.  WILL NEVER GO BACK due to EXPENSE and variety.\n\nOne salad.\nOne pizza that had little topping\nTwo vodka's\none sangria\none beer\ntwo pasta dishes (that were minuscule)\n$107.00.\n\nWhat a screwing.

0,The worst place to rent a limo. I made a reservation 3 days before my wedding then the have the balls to call me in the middle of my wedding demanding more money from me. Are you serious? I made a reservation 3 days before my wedding and you find the mistake an hour before I'm scheduled to get picked up? Never again.
0,Not real BBQ...just over cooked meat.
1,"After a respite and coffee post Mad Mex insane margaritas, we headed here to continue our Pittsburgh adventures.  I loved the band the minute we walked in, and it was packed for a Thursday night.  Everyone knew each other, and people were super friendly.  The bartender actually made me a Hypnotiq martini, which I had never had before and I loved it.  I switched to my mainstay vodka martinis later in the evening, and we all had a great time, dancing and meeting people.  On a Thursday night and with great friends this place was really fun!"
0,"My boyfriend and I were in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to eat here for lunch since it had a great view of the strip and was conveniently located to our hotel. The second we walked in, I was immediately turned off by how unprofessional the hostess was. Not only did she fail to welcome us, she also got mad when we asked to move seats because the sun was in our eyes. As we were sitting at our table waiting for our drinks to come, the table next to us had 6 people although it was only a table made for 4 people, a waitress came outside and made the extra 2 people leave and while walking away (right in front of me) rolled her eyes and started cussing to her other coworker about how stupid those customers were. Throughout my entire meal, I saw at least three employees cussing and saying negative things about the customers at the restaurant. This is absolutely ridiculous - I have never seen such unprofessional employees in my life. I was even scared that I would get talked poorly about in order to ask where the bathroom was. I will never go back here or any other Hard Rock Cafe restaurants."
0,"My stylist  was Raphael.  The haircut was mediocre, at best.  The color coverage was incomplete.  I had quite a bit of gray hair left all around my hairline, especially at the temples and in the middle of my forehead.  The young woman that I spoke with the following day,  mentioned that he KNEW he had missed all of that gray hair.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL FOR SUCH A GROSSLY OVER-PRICED SALON!   Due to his limited availability and my 57 hour work week, scheduling an appointment to correct this was difficult, (over a week out).  Unfortunately, I had to reschedule this appointment in order to work late.  Again, scheduling conflicts became a hinderence to a timely resolution.  However, when I asked if the timing would be an issue, I was ASSURED that there would be NO PROBLEM.  Consequently, I was surprised when the salon called me ONE HOUR before I was to come in for the color correction.  The call was to inform me that I needed to pay 25%, since too much time had passed.  Not even the owner cared whether I was satisfied or would be a returning client.\n\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE--SLOPPY COLOR--BIG $$$ FOR  NOTHING--BUYER BEWARE"
0,This place is just ok.  Nice decor but its always dead when I walk by here while going into Firefly.  So my wife and I call this place Deadfly cuz no one is ever in there when we walk by.\n\nWe only ate here once.  The food was alright.  Nothing to write home about.  Sushi was comparable to Makino but more expensive.  I did enjoy the fact that they has Orion beer (okinawan beer) which is great but pricey.  I'd rather just go to Ichiza any day of the week.
0,"I decided to try this place with family during my trip to Montreal. The menu was looking good and it was totally packed inside. The more people you see inside means it's a good place, right? Wrong!\n\nWe were seated by a kind server who took forever to come back just to get our drink orders. The drinks arrived, and the server disappeared again for a long time. Finally, our orders were taken and the food took forever to come, and when they dishes were presented to us, they were slapped on the table and off went the server into a far away land. \n\nI didn't like my food at all, nor did anyone else at the table. It was bland and boring, also pretty expensive for the poor quality you received and the dinky portions. I ordered a risotto which was bland and small and cost around $20!\n\nI'm going to avoid this place during my next visit to Montreal."
0,"We've stayed at a bunch of hotels on the strip through the years from Imperial Palace to the Monte Carlo. Bally's is more on par with IP if not worse. Where do I start? Well, you get into your room and it's the most depressing 70s looking room with their teal/blue couch. The room is spacious but nothing to look at. The mattress was so old and flat that it was probably bought in the 70s (ok, probably not but might as well) since it was not comfortable. .\n\nGood luck in finding an outlet to charge your cell phone. I looked near the night stand but that would have been too easy and convenient.  No luck. I kept looking and looking and finally found ONE outlet.\n\nIf you want some nice peace and quiet, then don't bother coming here. The walls are paper thin. We heard our neighbors talking every day. Yeah, not fun. Oh, and don't forget the lovely yelling at night outside the window.  We were lucky that we were staying above the 10th floor so we didn't have to deal with construction but our friend was on the 5th floor and he got no sleep. He did get a room change and had his room comped but he looked like crap and ended up getting sick with no sleep and working. \n\nThe casino was more annoying than entertaining. It's so small and cheesy that I wouldn't spend my money there but it's still filled with smokers so you'll be inhaling second hand smoke like being in a real casino. In summary,  there are too many other nice hotels on the strip for me to ever want to return here."
0,spent tooo much money... on nothing. \nthe food is mediocre.  the vendors are pretty whack.  \nthe carnival was lame.  my kids weren't excited. \n\ni've only been once.. and never went back.\n\nit's like a poem! a bad poem!  like this review.
1,"Whether you live in Ben Avon Heights, Brighton Heights - or anywhere in between - I urge you to try China Sea.  It is quite simply the best local Chinese delivery.  The people on the phone are helpful and friendly.  The delivery is always quoted at 45 minutes, yet the food always arrives earlier and is always unbelievably hot and fresh.  Some favorites of ours are the Kung Pao shrimp, pork lo mein and hot and sour soup.  I don't mean to compare China Sea to the higher end Chinese restaurants in our area.  It is not Sesame Inn or China Palace; it is not a \""date night out\"" sort of place. It most definitely is a cozy, inexpensive, good quality \""stay in and relax\"" go to.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!\n\nps\nA few final thoughts while we were going back for seconds; they only use all white meat chicken in their dishes.\npps\nAlways look at their online coupons, you will get something free!"
0,"I don't think I've ever complained about price in a review, but $12.54 for a fast food cheeseburger, fries, and a medium drink?  The burger was ok and the fries were pretty good. Probably won't be back. Too many better choices out there (Lobby's, Zipps, Macs, 4Peaks, and of course the greatest of all The Chuck Box)."
0,The worst KFC ever. Apparently they can only take one order at a time. Had to wait 15 minutes before I could order.
1,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the city. My favorite is the Thai Basil Fried Rice, but everything I've ordered has been phenomenal. It's an awesome atmosphere- dim lights, relaxed, quiet, calm- and the tea is great. My only gripe is that the tap water tasted like crap every time I've ordered it. All things considered it is a really good, affordable restaurant."
0,Looks like this place went out of business.  Website has expired and doors look locked up.
1,"Very good lechon kawali! It was great, tender, and fatty just like a good pork belly should be =9. But at $9 for the serving, it will leave you hungry for more.  Didn't try the other menu items which consisted of lumpia, bbq chicken etc. which I'm sure would be equally delicious. would be 5 stars if the money to food ratio was a tad better for a hungry dude."
1,"Yum, Yum, Yum!  Like everyone else I came here because of man vs. food and the great ratings on yelp.  This place is for sure a \""hole-in-the-wall\"" joint, but at the end of the day what matters is the food.  I found the food to be extremely unique with fatty ingredients, but surprisingly not \""fatty\"" tasting.  In all reality these sandwiches are HUGE.  I personally ate half of a half of the famous torta and some chicken quesadilla and I was done until the morning.  The aqua fresca was also right on point.  I had the pina one and it was delicious.  \n\nTo sum it up, I really liked this place.  I plan on going back to try some of the great looking mexican food they have.  We didn't have to wait and the service was just fine.  Give this place a try... it is worth it for the experience alone, but the food doesn't hurt - that's for sure."
0,"Average Vegas hotel. Beds are aged, In the morning between 8-10am when you want to sleep you'll hear knocking on doors and a squeaky voice saying 'housekeeping' til you want to scream. Concierge has no clue, got us tickets for re wrong night at a show."
1,"I'm only commenting on the salon because that is all I went to during my stay at the hotel.  I was lucky to get a last minute reservation to get a manicure since it was Mother's Day weekend and they were apparently booked the entire time.\n\nI got an essential manicure with Marilyn and she was awesome.  She was friendly without being overly so, and we had a nice conversation while she dealt with my train wreck nails.  \n\nThe salon offers complimentary mimosa's which in hindsight I wish I had indulged in one, but I passed. \n\nThings to note:\n\nThis is not a cheap place.  You are paying more for the ambiance than probably the quality.  It wasn't bad, but you can get  a cheaper everything if you go somewhere else.  That being said, I was staying at the hotel and enjoyed the convenience and was willing to pay more for it.\n\nThey automatically add in a 20% tip.  They do make you aware of this, but not until after your service.  I am sure it is posted somewhere, but I didn't know until it was point out when I went to pay.  \n\nI am looking forward to trying some of the spa services next time I stay at the hotel.  I was jealous of everyone walking around in bath robes looking so relaxed."
1,"Whenever I'm visiting my parents in Phoenix, I like to stop by this place. I went there frequently from the moment they opened to the moment I moved to Tempe. I LOVE their tonkotsu ramen, and their gyoza is the best I've ever had! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. So pleased to have them in Happy Valley Towne Center!"
1,Stayed in the newest tower. Octavius.  Opened Jan 2012.  Nice room.  Qua Spa and fitness center was awesome. Great location. The Forum offers unlimited dining and shopping.  Good conference hotel. Casino a little too smokey but otherwise had a god experience
0,Just plain rude. Didn't answer questions. Then when I asked how long the wait she shrugged her shoulders.
1,"I love sitting at the counter with my Kids looking at the food being cooked and watching them lost in amazement at all that is going on.\nFood is served fast, hot with great presentation, love the coke machine, seems to have 1000 combinations of flavors."
0,"Pretty dumpy place. We got a room here because it was the cheapest place we could find that was anywhere near downtown. The ceiling had weird brown spots on it that looked like someone threw feces at it. The sheets were pretty scratchy and the bed and pillows were not very comfortable. The bed cover had stains on it, everything just looked pretty dingy. The building outs pretty confusing and it is pretty dumb that you can't get from the lobby to your room after 11:00pm since you have to go through the pool area. Just a ridiculous set up if you ask me. Would probably spend a few extra bucks and go elsewhere next time."
1,"One cool evening, I was strolling down the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, thinking it would be like any other typical dinner night-out for Veteran's Day. Before arriving at my designated place for eating, my feet carried me past the most romantic, unique, enticing display of ooh la la's I have ever seen for such a quaint little boutique: Agent Provacateur.\n\nOh how adorable those quirky mannequins looked in frilly, salacious, provocative displays of pink and black silken lace--along with a background wallpaper of the shop's own \""star graphic novel character\"", all decked out (at least for the time being ;D ) in her signature undercover brown trench coat--the Agent herself.\n\nOh how my secret love and desire for all things romantic, unique and classic ached my heart so much to want me to go enter that forbidden threshold, as if I were a child who has her nose pressed up on the glass, to the window that reveals the world of hidden candy goodies--in this case, eye candy goodies.\n\nOh how I long to be clothed and adorned in such frivolity! My secret desire, no one new--until now. To be an aspiring, glamorous retro pin-up model; to be like those classic, timeless women of the 1940's and 1950's--Marylin Monroe, Bettie Page--with such a carefree yet confident and flirty, coy attitude; a \""come hither\"", girl-next-door personality--a secret naughty mixed with suspicious nice--that will blind the eyes and melt the heart of any man and ignite the fantasies that dance in their minds--all from the power of a single, simple, yet artistic pin-up photograph. \n\nOh yes, how I long for that romantic dream to be a reality! But alas! I can only remain as a Romantic with no hope. All I can do now is be like those children who press their nose against that window glass and peer into the world of secret, untouchable goodies--knowing that their dear parents will never grant them the permission to indulge their senses in that sweet ecstasy.\n\nAnd so it has been done, my state of trance has been extinguished by the outrageous cost listed on the sales tag price ($200+ for a set)! Oh yes, I have strolled through the boutique and looked at the goodies through cyberspace (http://AgentProvocateur.com), and have seen the frivolous price tag for all the goods (still super expensive unless you sign up for their newsletter; you can get in on their secret, 50%-75% off sales if you do so)!\n\nSo it seems now that my hopeful reality must further be delayed; further be suspended in that intoxicating, tantalizing trance. Until then....until then....one day, I will be blessed by the fairy godmother of financial goodies, and at last I shall be that frivolous, voluptuous, vivacious pin-up bombshell that I so longed to be!\n\nSomeday....you and I shall be sinister partners-in-crime, Agent Provocateur.\n\n* Did you know that Agent Provocateur was founded by Joseph Corr\u00e9, son of the most influential fashion designer of the entire fashion world, Vivienne Westwood? Vivienne Westwood is the founding mother of punk fashion. Corr\u00e9 is also the son of the Sex Pistol's ex -manager, Malcolm McLaren. SEX PISTOLS! VIVIENNE WESTWOOD! How much more punk can you get? That makes the Agent Provocateur line extra special...and innocently kinky! ;D"
0,"Misdiagnosed an engine issue.  Didn't refund money...continued to look for the issue and kept the cash.  Came up with an estimate of TWICE price of what was actually needed to fix my problem.\n\nOffers hard cookies and coffee while you wait.  \n\nIf you need work done on your Chevy, I'd recommend Ballweg in Middleton.  Better stuff to eat while you wait, internet and computer stations to play on and coffee, soda, water, hot chocolate."
0,"Boring... Perhaps this place is jumping at times other than when we visited but I was sorely under impressed with this place.\n\nThe food was average and nothing really stood out. And hell, all the drinks are overly expensive. $9.50 for a drink the size of a small styrofoam cup? This is Vegas right?\n\nAnyways, the experience I'm sure is greater when its overly packed and has more going on. Perhaps if people are drunk enough when they arrive, it will mask skimp and over priced drinks, and the bland atmosphere during its off peak times."
1,"They have an extremely helpful staff and I was able to try on multiple shoes without feeling pressured to by anything.  I wanted to try on some different types of running shoes so I could get a feel for them.  They were extremely accomodating.  I've been to another running store that breathed down my neck wanting me to buy.  Not here.  Great selection of shoes and gear, albeit a little expensive for my tasted.  They do weekly or bi-weekly runs as well."
0,"This restraunt is all hype, im sure most of these comments are made up.\nFirst of all the place looks real nice, the service is great, I love triple d show and that alone made me want to come over and try it out.\n\nBut the food is just not worth the high prices, and people saying the portions are huge are straight up lying.  We ordered the wiskey wings, 9 bitesize tiny wings for $15, the menu claims they are super hot, but they are not even close to being hot. The taste was not that good and the blue cheese and ranch sauses are disgusting. I had better wings at applebees, and better ranch sauce at jack in the box.\n\nNext we tried the Cesar salad, again not that good either and i have no idea what that wall of hard bread on the salad was, looked like a monster crouton but it was not eatable..\n\nSo finally I asked for the best burger so I got the mac and cheese burger...  People claim burger is huge but its really just a decent size and its pricey $19.. The burger was just ok thats it. If thats the best they had i wonder how the others taste. I couldnt even taste the macaroni on the burger.. Honestly i had better burgers at chillis.. Now the fries on the other had were great, they mix 4 different kind of fries together and are tastey..\n\nAll I gotta say this place might be for other people but it wasnt for us, it looked like they are trying to hard to make the plates look fancy and cute but the taste just isn't there.. And not worth the high prices.."
0,"I have to disagree with everyone else about this place. I called to order a plain cheese pizza for delivery, the guy who took my order told me my pizza will be delivered in 45mins. So I waited and waited, waited some more. As I seen the time has gone by it's been 1 hour and my food isn't still here. So I called them to see where has my pizza taken place at! They said it's on it's way. So I waited again til finally after waiting for almost 2 hours for a pizza delivery I finally got my pizza. And it was cold. The chocolate eclair they gave me was old. I was very disappointed. So I DO NOT recommend ANYONE to order from this place. They Suck at delivery."
1,"Great Ribeye, probably would've been a great Porterhouse if it wasn't 86'ed while I was there.  Service staff was great and I would've added one more star if they hadn't asked me eleventy billion times to remove my plate even though I wasn't done with my food.  Otherwise, if you are willing to pay for it, great food."
0,I have never been to the Polka Dot Bakeshop but I just bought a box of their SWEET POTATO CRACKER with chipotle and smoked paprika.  Sounds wonderful doesn't it?  Well it was disgusting!  I bought them at Fresh Market in Indianapolis and I wonder if the buyer from the store even sampled them.  A piece of cardboard with pepper on it would have had more sweet potato flavor than these crackers.  Go back to the drawing board with these.  They are TERRIBLE!
1,"Have been coming here for years ...... as good as it gets if you are not from New York and have enjoyed the real deal from Artuso's in the Bronx. My favories are the Black and Whites, Canolis, and the rainbow cookies. Also have a great canoli cake as well."
0,"Our friends that we met in Vegas said Koi was Mikuni's quality.  If you are from the Sacramento area and are a fan of sushi, then I am sure you know about Mikuni's and how excellent Mikuni's is.  Well, granted our friends moved away from Roseville over 5 years ago and I guess they forgot just how good Mikuni's was.  We opted not to Yelp Koi, our mistake and just take our friends word.  I will say we sat in the Fountain Room, over looks the fountain light show at Bellagio, it was beautiful the first couple times of checking it out, then you kind of forget about what's going on outside because at this point, you are working on not dying from hypothermia.  \n\nOK, enough about that, we ordered up a bunch of different overpriced sushi rolls and unfortunately not one of them was memorable.  Our tab was $180 bucks for four of us and we did have a bottle of wine.  One would think with a price tab like that you would probably be leaving the place full and quite satisfied.  well that didn't happen and the reason is, the rolls are small, pretty simple really and nothing over the top like the rest of Vegas.\n\nI suppose for a couple hundred more we could have walked away full, but it is hard to pay that much money for mediocre sushi rolls.\n\nBut don't fear, Pinks hotdogs is just down stairs and their Polish dog finished off the job.\n\nFriends, if you go to Vegas, let the reviewers help you decide on where to go.  After our friends left to go home to CO, we went to a great place, 4 stars in Yelp, called Eggs and I.  I would give it a solid 4 as well and we went to a great place for lunch, 4 stars again in Yelp, called Hot n' Juicy Crawfish.  I would actually rate this one a 5 and will in just a moment."
0,"Worst service! I have given this store numerous chances, kid managers who don't care trying to get shoes is a joke! Can't believe it's still open! I lived here my whole life and been going to big 5 forever! This one is bad, go to south eastern if u want customer service."
1,"Good food, great drinks, friendly staff, fair prices... Classy but not snobby. I just wish they opened earlier, but if they don't need to, then good for them."
0,Food will not knock your socks off. Food borders on ordinary to bland. Frozen beverages taste like flavored sugar. Definitely over rated. Plus place is always packed!
1,"We made a reservation here and am very happy we tried this place. We ordered the dim sum steamed platter, pepper steak and duck udon. Everything was flavorful and tender... But cost way too much (-1). \n\nIt's a great place to try once or maybe for date night but I find it unlikely for me to return to try again."
1,"I stopped in to get take out on my way home one afternoon after noticing they had opened. The employees were all very friendly and i liked the fact that the kitchen is open so you can watch how they prepare the food. Everything is made fresh daily. I ended up trying the vaca frita (the shredded tri tip) and though I have never had Cuban food before so I have nothing to compare it too, I thought it was very good. I know my husband and kids will like it when I go back with them next time."
0,"Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay, but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers, and last time, I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time."
0,This review is for the Casino only. We did not stay in the rooms. \n\nWe walked across the street from our casino (the golden nugget) to play in a different one. The Four Queens is what we came to first. \n\nWe sat down to play some video poker and the bar tender was rather rude to us. Giving us attitude because I asked him to break a bill so I could tip him for our drinks (fine then...don't want a tip I guess?) Also I'm not sure how it is in most casinos...but usually when you play a certain amount of video poker you get your drinks comped. Not here!! SO the bar tender being rude and what not we left to the gaming floor. NOT A COCKTAIL WAITRESS IN SIGHT. Ok...I don't need a drink to gamble. BUT WAIT. Why are all the slots dirty with full to the brim ashtrays and empty drinks all over the place? I guess no one cleans over here? \n\nAs we were walking out we did notice that security was kicking out a couple of hookers...so I guess they have decent security? \n\nWasn't really a fan of the gaming floor nor how clean it was. I doubt I will ever actually end up staying here.
0,Do not use this lady... She is not trustworthy. We were supposed to have invitations sent 6 weeks prior or the big day. We could not get a hold of her and when we did it was excuse after excuse. Finally the invites went out three weeks prior to wedding after several mistakes.
0,"Sick is the only word to describe. This place made me want to call a health inspector right away. The place smelled strongly of cleaning fluid when I entered, but the place was filthy....how does that happen? My daughter has been begging to go here, but I don't remember it being so bad. There was food all over the floor, spill signs everywhere, trash, dirty tables, etc. I ate some chicken that was goodish, I had some more and spit it out cuz it was pinkish inside. I was scared of the shrimp. The salad bar was horrendous. Yellow-brown iceberg with warmish veggies and dressings. ..yum sounds so good. coagulated mac and cheese and burned pizza. The stuff looks like its been sitting there since 1991. Dirty plates, silverware, walls, floors, everything! Nobody bussed our table, 6 dirty plates and not one of them moved. Coke was out, ice ran out, cups ran out. I have never felt so dirty after going to a restaurant, I need a shower. I can see, however, by the clientele that this is up to some peoples' standards. A guy walked next to me, dropped his straw, left it, said oh well and got a new one. I think the bum sitting next to me was the cleanest one, since he licked his plate and stacked them neatly. The food here is just gross, all fried, canned, and bagged and probably unsafe. I would rather go to Golden Corral or Sweet tomatoes. Never again, Hometown. Never."
0,"I purchased new glasses at Lenscrafters in San Tan Village, but had problems with the 1.74 high index lenses when heat was applied to the frame (to adjust them), this damaged the lenses and caused the lenses to become permanently streaky, this was most noticeable when driving at night.  I had the 1.74 lenses changed a few times by Lenscrafters but they were damaged as soon as heat was applied to adjust the frames for comfort.  I was subsequently advised by Lenscrafters to revert to 1.67 to avoid having this problem.  I did this and the new 1.67 lenses are fine.\n\nAlso I purchased prescription sunglasses but when I received them I could not see clearly with them even though I was assured they were the same prescription as my new glasses.  I took them to another opticians and they said they were not exactly the same prescription as my new glasses.  I took them back to Lenscrafters and they took the sunglasses back and gave me a refund.  I got prescription sunglasses at another opticans and have had no problem with them at all.\n\nSheralee and Bonnie are fantastic.  Sheralee is awesome.  I had been back to Lensecrafters quite a few times and she was extremely helpful and courteous.  Sheralee and Bonnie are the two redeeming staff members who ensure that the customer is very well taken care of and the after sales service is great.  Unfortunately because of the problems I have mentioned above, I will not be returning to Lenscrafters in San Tan Village."
1,"Visited V Bar for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. Great atmosphere and good music. My guests from Holland loved it. Affordable, fun with good service. Jorge, one of the hosts got us a great table and bottle service. Thanks for accommodating our large group. It was great start to our night. Thanks Jorge for a great time. We will definitely come back."
1,"Beautiful shinny rich textures and colors. This certainly were my first impressions. Every wall, floor and column seemed to sparkle with \""bling\"". I love the three floor chandelier, it's absolutely beautiful!\nIt's very unusual for a casino to actually have places to sit and well just sit.  We found places like that all over.  \n\nWe signed up and got our players card, I even tried a few slot machines, have to admit, I didn't win a lot, but walked away happy.  First time for us here, we brought family to take a look and knew we would be heading to the buffet soon enough.  \n\nI love what I have seen so far and if what I read about the rooms is anything like they say, we may have to give it ago."
0,"Stopped in with my son and two of his friends after Charlotte Oktoberfest.  Sat at the counter and placed our orders.  Munched on onion rings to start, but before we finished.the manager apparently decided we were too loud, or obnoxious, or something, because he told us we needed to leave.  It was surreal.  We did NOTHING wrong and were not misbehaving in any way.  The dude \""managing\"" the place should be fired.  He's a tool and I will never go back.\n\nI understand if you think this is \""sour grapes\"" and we were drunk & obnoxious after the beer festival.  I assure you that is NOT the case.  The food looked and smelled delicious and we all were eagerly awaiting the arrival of our respective entrees.  Then this guy's male menopause kicked in and we were out the door.  I know this review won't mean diddly, but he lost at least four customers for life on Saturday."
1,"The burger and fries, of course, were delicious! My favorite were the sweet potato fries. I was really looking forward to the sweet toffee pudding pops, but unfortunately they were out :( However, I would definitely come back to this place!"
0,"New owners and used to go by Pho Ao Sen. Interior is the same, staff is different and in my opinion not as friendly. Pho broth is a step down from before and not nearly as flavorful. I think these guys are trying to do to much by offering Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese and Vegetarian. Get Vietnamese right first, then maybe try and expand your menu."
0,"Used Yelp to try to find a place to get a breakfast sandwich on our walk up to Edinburgh Castle and Hula looked the most promising. As much as I'd like to support local businesses, I wish we had just gone to Starbucks. I got a bagel with cream cheese and my husband got a ham/cheese bagel. They were fine, but so overpriced. For the same amount of money we could have gotten breakfast sandwiches with better stuff in them (like actual eggs!) from Starbucks."
1,"Incredibly underrated. This is some of the best food I have had in Las Vegas. \nI always get the spicy beef burrito without rice (personal preference, meh). The beef is marinated beautifully. The sauces provided to apply to the burrito are amazing. The selection of vegetables on the burrito is excellent, with extremely fresh greens/avocado/others. I love the food because it is especially high-quality and very fresh, which I really appreciate."
0,"My sister and I have a standing \""nail date\"" every other Sunday. I suggested we went to tip n toes because I have been to the one off of Scottsdale road and usually get exceptional services done there. I could not believe how rude the woman was to us! All we wanted was a gel manicure each and she asked us if we would be doing a solid color or French and we both said solid and she said they would only have time for one manicure. It was at around 2:30 and the salon doesn't close until 5:00 on Sundays- by no means was it busy in there AT ALL. Shocked and appalled- we walked out. I'm so embarrassed I suggested this place of business after I talked them up so much. Too bad this location isn't like the other ones in the valley. We will just go back to our favorite place in Chandler."
1,"I tried this place a couple weeks ago for lunch, and it was good.  I got the garlic chili vegetables with tofu...heat level 3.  Boy was I sweating!  Really good though!  The only bad things were that the soup was barely warm and the toilet wouldn't flush in the ladies room.  Great service though....food came out super fast!  Will definitely go again."
1,This place is awesome!! Friendly staff and treats that are to die for. I especially enjoyed their fruit and yogurt parfait!
0,Went by reviews on Yelp and this place was not good at all.  The lunch special had no different price and two of the buffet table were empty!  Food was bland and not much variety!  Try something else before going here.
1,"Now that it looks alot different from the last time that I was there, it took my breath away.  It has expanded and it is beeeeaautiful!!! This is one of the best spas that I have ever experienced in my life and I've been to alot of spas.  My family works in this business so we are very judgemental when it comes to spas.  They have their own cafe with, not only delicious, but healthy as well food.  The only thing is that they are strict when booking and canceling, but it's understandable, and that sometimes they can be completely booked or have limited time slots.  So they're doing great in business.  My recommendation; book ahead of time, (the sooner the better), don't miss your appointment or cancel last minute, and arrive early or stay late to enjoy and make good use of the spa because they have ALOT going on.  (good thing... different things for you to enjoy)"
0,"Employees stood around while I'm waiting for my to-go milkshake. Locating inside an airport, isn't it common sense that people are rushing to their flight, especially if it's a to-go order. After waiting for more then 10 mins for my shake, I went over to the kitchen side and asked if my shake was ready. Then they started making it! What the heck? What were they standing around for????"
0,"WORST JEWELER IN TOWN.... I purchased a ring from my Jewler in California and brought it in to get resized... Something as simple as that and thought I could trust them to do it... They seem like a trustworthy Jewler... So I thought. When I went back to pick up my ring the Jewler in the process had scratched the glass on the ring they said that they would fix it..  When I came back almost a month and a half later my beautiful ring was ruined. I got it back with the jewlers finger print on the inside of the glass and epoxy visible on the glass... When I complained and told them they need to fix or replace my ring the response I got was \""you would have damaged it anyway\""... I was pissed and grabbed my ring and left... Worst experience and customer service... I will never go to them again nor will I refer anyone I know to go there... \nArisa Thepprasit"
1,"My boyfriend and I visited this day spa yesterday after purchasing a Groupon. The interior is nicely designed with light music and had that signature lavender smell of a spa.  Check-in was easy and we filled out all the normal paperwork. The woman at the front counter was busy answering the phones, making several Groupon appointments, but we weren't offered any water or the typical,  'Your massage therapist will be right with you' once we turned in the paperwork. I was greeted by Dominic a short time later and led back to my room.\n\nThe room is typical for a day spas. The only ambiance in the room was a candle holder on the wall. There was a counter in the back and a small bench to place your clothes in the corner. The music continued to play in the room on the overhead speakers throughout the massage. It would have been nice to see a little more decoration in the room to make it feel more inviting. I'm not sure why these places don't invest a little more into decorations and give it a true spa feel. Additionally, the music overhead was okay but it would be a nice touch to be offered a different music selection if possible. Granted, this is all wishful thinking and above and beyond what you typically see in a day spa but it would have put this place over the top because my massage was fantastic!\n\nDominic asked if there way anything I needed extra attention on before starting and he did an excellent job of massaging just the right places. I've had several massages before but I would say this is definitely one of my top. Maybe it was because of his technique (long, slow movements) but it definitely was something I enjoyed very much. He never asked how the pressure was (I requested Medium) but luckily it was perfect throughout. Would highly recommend him to anyone!"
0,"Dinner with family, for some reason I couldn't convince them to go to our usual taco place. So we thought we'd give Chuy's a try.\n\nThe chips and salsa were quite good. Not a puree of tomatoes, there were actual pieces in there. A bit wet, so it's drippy. We also got an order of guacamole to go with it. It arrived in a medium sized bowl and it looked like a lot. Until we got near the bottom and discovered that it was sitting on a small nest of shredded lettuce. Oops. The chips were hot and fresh. Thinner than I'm used to, they had a habit of breaking off in the guac.\n\nDeep menu of burritos and tacos and salads with Mexican beers, sangria and margaritas. When I cut into my \""chicken\"" burrito, it turned out to be beef. The waitress was most apologetic and offered to replace it (she said the kitchen made it wrong even though she ordered it right) but it was good so I stuck with it. My daughter had the Elvis special which is a bucket load of food. Unless you are a serious eater, I'd recommend you move on to something else. My wife had the chicken taco salad which of course comes in a massive fried tortilla shell.\n\nThe music and noise in the restaurant is extremely loud. The pictures on the wall and the angles of the walls do nothing to absorb sound at all.\n\nThey say it's TexMex, but I dunno. It just seemed like fancy Mexican to me.\n\nParking isn't easy but it's doable. Try the parking deck for Southpark if it's legal."
0,"Again this review is not about show but how you get treated with general admission ticket. I arrived at show 45 min before show opens with general admission ticket. Still got last seat. Seating arrangement in back for general admission ticket is flat, so if some one is seating in front of you ( which off course many people will) you won't see a thing. It was waste of money and time. Will never go again there."
1,Best tea I have ever had.  Great prices and wonderful service.  The cupcakes are amazing.  I have been several times and always try something new because there are so many types and blends.
1,"I was chillin with the homies a couple weeks ago and we stopped by this hole in the wall to get some Korean food. You would not expect this place to have Korean food if you just drove by the place. I only found out about this place cause my homie is a regular.\n\nI ordered the Bi Bim Bop, which is beef, rice, veggies and a fried egg. We wanted to dine-in but we got there 10 minutes before they were closing. We decided to get old school and picked up some cold ones and ate our food at the park. There was a lot of food and it tasted good for a hole in the wall.\n\nI will come back to try their Kimchi Soup."
1,"A series of controversial reviews made me hesitate about this place in the beginning but I'm happy that I decided to check it for myself. The food was excellent, the price was reasonable and the restaurant was clean and elegant. I loved the Koobideh which is by far the best I've had in the Persian restaurants in the States.  Definitely will go again at my next trip to Vegas."
1,"The day we went there, we dint find any pizzas on their menu. We were kinda puzzled - isn't a pizzeria supposed to serve pizza? We're mostly vegetarians, so we ordered their caprese and vegetarian sandwich hot. was so good. will definitely go back!"
1,Very clean and comfortable. Perfect location to do some great site seeing. Free shuttle to almost any part of Pittsburgh. Some great places to eat within walking distance.
1,Second visit here. Excellent food. Seabass is amazing.  Salads are delicious and fresh.
0,"Groomer does a great job but their prices are so inconsistent. I used to get charged $40 per dog then it went up to $45 then now, they just tried charging me $50 - this in a matter of 6 months!  RIDICULOUS!!!"
0,"We had lunch here on a Monday. The place was not busy at all. The food was far from spectacular. We used points from the players card to pay for our buffet. Thank goodness because the  food was horrendous. I would never pay for this buffet with my own money. The service was great other than that this buffet just like the establishment its built-in,is on a downward spiral into.the toilet."
1,"It's wonderful to have Mr. Gyros in the neighborhood - this area is absolutely STARVED for more places like this.  Good, fast, cheap, and way better than any of the drive-through chains!"
1,"We have visited both the location in Surprise and the location in Arrowhead on several occassions and have never been disappointed. As others have mentioned, the complimentary bread and dipping oil is wonderful. I could make a meal of that alone with a bottle of wine. ;-) \n\nSome of the things we have had....Bruschetta Romana = good, Firecracker Rolls = husband likes, not my favorite, Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad = LOVE, Calzone = Husband loves, Kid's calzone = son orders every time, Italiano Sandwich and Buffalo Chicken Ceasar Sandwich = my adult daughters love. \n\nMy personal favorite meal would be the bread followed by the Roasted Brussels Sprout Beet Salad and The Amalfi Thin & Crusty pizza served with a nice bottle of red wine. I have had some of their pasta dishes as well and they were all very good.\n\nI have never tried their spaghetti and meatballs. I make those at home and can't see paying someone else to make them for me. :)\n\nThe Italian Sodas are a hit with the kids!"
1,"Went for my 21st birthday, got upgraded to a forum tower suite 23rd floor overlooking the pools. 2 bathrooms with an entrance to a double shower headed shower in each bathroom. Huge tub, tons of mirrors and closet space. Beautiful room, within walking distance of the best hotels. Had the time of my life."
1,"I travel to Las Vegas several times per year and find most of the venues either tacky, tired, or trying too hard.  The Cosmopolitan was a breath of fresh air.  Nicely decorated rooms, great gaming space,  fantastic dining options, and a friendly outgoing staff all come together to provide a top notch experience.  \n\nIf you stay on property, the rooms and suites facing the strip are spacious, stylish, and have fantastic views of the Strip.\n\nGood luck."
1,"I'm not from AZ, but I found this shop online. They've got a large selection of gear. I don't know why, but my experience w/ their customer service is completely opposite from some of the others giving this place a lower rating. I bought my girlfriend's snowboard setup from skipro for a good deal w/ free shipping (Xmas gift), board n bindings came quick, but I received 2 of the same side bindings (2 rights). Note, these were 09 bindings. I called them right away, but unfortunately, they didn't have the size I needed in stock. So they gave me a sweet deal for some 2010 bindings for the same model! On another occasion, I ordered some new bindings for myself, but there was a defect in one of the adjustable footbeds. Again, I was on the phone w/ them. They emailed me the UPS return slip, called me when they got them back and kept me updated w/ the progress. (it couldn't be repaired in the store so they contaced the manufacturer for replacement). Only negative I have is that I've had to send something back to them on both of my transactions, but I have to give them 4 stars for the customer service I've experienced. Maybe you'll have better customer service if you deal with them online rather than in person. Go figure."
0,"This was our place to go for years and we were never disappointed. The owner was always there to make sure everything is good, Then, they changed the owner and it started to go down the hill. We so wish that it could go back to the way it was. If the current owner reads this review, he should really pay attention before he has to close the door one day."
1,"I was in Vegas for a meeting, and noticed the Bernina sign -- just had to stop.  It is a beautiful, clean and well stocked fabric store.  So many high quality brands, I had a hard time deciding what to get.  There is a lot of inspiration in the form of quilts, handbags, and some clothing items displayed.  The staff was friendly and attentive.\nThey had some kind of class going on in a very spacious training facility.  I'd love to see a store like this in Scottsdale!"
1,"This place has fantastic food.  Yes, it is pricey.  By the time all was said and done it was close to ~$45 a person.   But wow.   Calamari appetizer is the best calamari I've ever had.   The tuna appetizer was also outstanding and I could have had it as a meal - it was beautiful.  Crab cake entree was really great too - so many places have nasty crab cakes with mostly breading.  Hubby had pork chop which looked great.   We've been here twice now, and plan to go back soon!  Food is truly lovely.  We've had good service both times as well."
1,"My boss took me to this place on their stop in NoDa.  We ordered our tacos from truck (my first visit I had drunken chicken, my second time ever I had one of their specials) then went into the NoDa Brewery for some beer while waiting.  The man brought our tacos into the brewery for us.  The platter comes with two tacos and a small side.  I got green rice, which is sooooo delicious.\n\nThe tacos themselves were sheer heaven.  The filling was delicious and was cooked perfectly.  Needed some napkins as my drunken chicken taco was a little drippy, but I didn't care that I made a mess of myself.  It was delicious and I was off the clock.\n\nI have a frequent visitor card to the Tin Kitchen and I fully intend on filling that card SOON."
1,"First visit here was last night with my parents (in from out of town). We originally went to Houston's and there was a 1hr wait... so we walked right across the parking lot, and were seated immediately at Veneto Trattoria (it was busy, just not packed).\n\nOne of the best Italian restaurants I have ever visited. I love that this is right in my neighborhood too! The prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, and the service impeccable. \n\nI enjoyed the pork chop, while my guests tried seafood, pasta, and salads. Everyone was very pleased with the experience.\n\nPlan on making this a regular stop."
0,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  I actually joined yelp expressly to write this bad review.  My friends and I were there for a concert on a Tuesday night.  Concert was supposed to start at 8.  At 10.15, the headlining band still hadn't started playing, but the roof *had* started leaking.  We decided to leave, but before we left we tried to talk to the management to express our disappointment and frustration.  They were entirely unsympathetic, however.  The whole experience was awful.  I will never come back here, no matter how much I might want to see the band, and I will actively recommend that friends don't come here either."
1,"Best Sushi in the area, nice staff, good service"
0,This was probably one of the worst pedicure experiences I've had. I usually go to a place closer to my house but my friend wanted to go get a pedicure and our normal place was closed so we decided to give them a try. First they didn't greet us and when they did speak to us they were very rude. Once we actually sat down we asked for just regular pedicures which on their website is called the quickie but instead they charged us for the basic. My friend even reminded the gentlemen working on her pedicure that she just wanted the simple one but he felt that she needed the upgrade so instead did that pedicure which was $10 more. So we paid $35 for a decent (that's being nice) pedicure. I have an ingrown toenail and whenever I go get a pedicure they take it out because it is not severe but the lady told me they don't take them out and all I replied was ok and she kept arguing why they won't do it and since I did not reply she started speaking a different language to the guy next to her and I guess they don't have a translation for an ingrown nail cause she kept saying that to him. Out of that I clearly understood that she was talking about me. I still stayed quite and then she started scrubbing my foot. She was really rough to the point where it started hurting so I told her to stop cause it hurt and she started to argue that it was the chemicals and kept scrubbing the area that hurt until I pulled my foot back. I've never had a pedicure that burned but apparently to them it was normal. So she told me to put my foot in the water and I did until it started burning more so I took it out but she kept pushing it back in until I told her to stop. I later came to realize that she had scrubbed so hard that she made little cuts on my toe and that's why it was burning. I've never had that happen anywhere but I still didn't say anything because I did not want to create a scene. She did a horrible job painting my toes because there was paint all over and she didn't even clean it off. I was done before my friend so I sat down to wait. Then we notice that she just drained the water and didn't even scrub or sterilize the sink before seating the next person for their pedicure. That is definitely a hazard and I want to report them because that is so unsafe. I hope that the cuts that she created on my foot don't get infected cause they clearly have no sterilization. Overall it was a horrible experience! Their service was horrible and they were so rude and unprofessional. I would not recommend this place at all. There are much better places that are open 24/7 and are priced better and have better quality service.
1,"We went here for my best friends birthday- party of 14.  We were seated at a table that was near the open kitchen.  Lots of room and great ambiance.  Our server was amazing.  He stayed on top of drinks orders and explained the menu in full detail while answering any questions we had.  I ordered the vegetable plate- you can pick three sides.  I chose Risotto(cooked to perfection), red quinoa salad with sliced almond(incredible) and chick pea fries that were very light and tasty.  Awesome time!  Awesome place!\nGreat for large parties or an intimate date."
1,"On a recent visit to Charlotte, a friend and her husband picked  me up at CLT to take me to my hotel, and we decided to get a bite to eat before they dropped me off.  They told me about Cowfish and how good their sushi was as well as their burgers and milkshakes.\n\nGranted it was a Friday evening, and it did not seem to be overly crowded, so I was not expecitng a 90 minute wait.  But it gave my friends and I a chance to sit and catch up as we waited."
0,"I don't usually review fast food 'restaurants' but I had to say something about this McDonald's. We came here twice, based upon convenience alone, and it was a train wreck. \n\nFirst of all, what is up with the ordering/pickup organization? When I have to squeeze into the same window as customers ordering, when I'm attempting to pick up a burger, this is a problem. Also, it seemed like the person 'shouting' out order numbers couldn't muster up the enthusiasm to actually call the numbers loud enough for customers to hear, which caused some confusion.\n\nAnd to top things off, I was put down for asking for napkins. Apparently, I was s'posed to know that napkins are in the fartherst corner of the food court. Shame on me for not knowing. I deserved the condescending attitude and to be treated like a moron. \n\nNever again."
0,"Was not even staying here, but let my friends who were getting married drive my car to carry all of their wedding stuff.  They parked it in the self park lot up on level 3 of the parking garage, and someone broke out the window in the middle of the day.  Luckily, nothing was stolen, but security was no help.  And, the casino was full of scumbags as I walked through it.  I felt bad for some of the normal folks that were there as I could see the disgusted expressions on their face as they had to wade through the trashy losers as I did to check on my vehicle.  I would never stay there since it seems so ghetto."

1,"I've only been here once, but I can't wait to go back.  \nI had the ceviche, the beef tenderloin, and the arroz con leche and it was all so extraordinary.\n\nThe portions were humongous.  The seafood was fresh and full of zest and flavor.  \n\nThe price was very reasonable.\n\nThe venue is a bit small, but the service is friendly and outgoing, and the ambiance is very clean and relaxing."
1,"Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  Also turns out it's well worth the drive.\n\nThe Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)\n\nWe started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.\n\nI had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made entirely of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Sp\u00e4tzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up well the next day, also--there was a lot of it.\n\nShe had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.\n\nAn older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.\n\nIt is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly."
0,"Very displeased gyro meat should be beef and lamb, not frozen pre shaped and sliced. It should be sliced off a rotating spit basting in its own juices. There gyro meat was dry with no taste, Chicken was also dry. Also menu pictures are not what you get for the price. Will not be back still waiting for a real Gyro Greek restaurant in Charlotte."
1,"My husband and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! Anytime I find myself craving Mexican food, the first place that pops in my head is Salsa Blanca. We have always encountered friendly, welcoming staff and amazing, fulfilling food. What more could you ask for?!"
1,"The first time I stayed at South Point was in mid of 2006, not long after they grand opened. It was very clean, large rooms, nice staff and not to mention the price....\n\nHave been a fan ever since then~~~though their price has doubled since then too... :)"
0,"This place does not know what they're doing. The doctor tried about 8 different pairs of contacts on me and never could figure out a new contact prescription for me and just ended up using my old prescription from my previous eye doctor which I could not see clearly out of anymore. Oh and by the way, he would not let me put these contacts in and out of my eyes myself, he insisted on sticking his fingers in my eyes to do it which I was not fond of at all! He told me it was faster if he did it - even if that is true, I do not want anyone's fingers in my eyes! Next, my glasses, a whole other big issue! They tried 3 times on my pair of glasses and still couldn't get them right and I now have a pair of glasses that I can never wear that I payed lots of money for. All this to say, my eyes aren't difficult to figure out - I went to a different eye doctor (Premier EyeCare of Arizona) and that doctor/staff was amazing and got everything right the FIRST TIME. Thanks to Premier EyeCare, they fixed Sonoran Desert's multiple screw ups and I now have glasses AND contacts that I can see clearly out of!"
0,"If you are looking for a sandwich there are better options even in the same complex. The salad was good and the chocolate strawberry at the end was a nice touch, but it couldn't overcome the prepackaged wet lunch meat sandwich. Had heard a ton of good things about it, but one visit was enough for me."
0,"I stopped my on my way home from church today.  I wanted to have them sand off the top coat from my acrylics, go home, change clothes, soak off my old nails, then come back to have a full new set put on.  They wanted to charge me to do that, even though I was coming back for a full service.  Ridiculous.  I walked out and will never go back."
0,"This place is obviously for tourists who don't know their way around Vegas. When we got there, they seated us I'm the dining room because it was Latin night. A place that serves tacos has a Latin night? It turns out there was a band who began laying in as we were leaving (which means we could have say in the dining room). The coctel was more like canned clams, canned crab, strangely halved shrimp in a ketchup sauce. The tacos were way overpriced, as was the beer. For the price of the carne asada, I expected some flavor and no gristle, but the most flavor I got from one was when I bit into the hidden lime. If you want some authentic Mexican food, get farther away from the strip and go somewhere that has actual recipes."
1,"A Definite Yes!\nNo its not NOBU its HIKARI \nAYCE Sashimi - that is fresh served in generous portions.\nAlso excellent cooked choices including an interesting FRALLOPS which is deep fried Sea Scallops. Perfectly tender and sweet inside, crispy, and not oily outside batter.\nChefs are terrific .. handling the volume of everyone at the sushi bar as well as the endless orders coming from restaurant as well.\nEveryone has a pleasant attitude and seems to enjoy what they do.\nBeen in 3X and was consistent on all visits so time for a review!\nIf you decide to go hope you enjoy also. \nSteady stream of people which allows them to keep everything fresh!"
0,"You know times are really getting bad when a shop like Meineke pulls this stuff. I have been getting my oil changed at Meineke for the last few years because they mail me oil change specials for $15.95. Yesterday ended all that. I went in yesterday (Saturday) to get my oil changed even though I figured I may have to wait because it's Saturday. There were no other customers there at 10:00 AM. I gave them my coupon and the keys and said I was going next door and would be back in 20 minutes. When I came back the manager said he had some bad news for me. He said I needed a power steering and brake fluid flush because the fluids were dirty. I said OK, show me the leak. He said there is no leak and I said no s**t, if there was I would have noticed it on the floor in my garage. Then I asked him if there was no leak how did my fluids get dirty? He sounded like Obama without a teleprompter, uh, uh ooo, uh, ahh, oh, oh. Then he told me I needed a fuel filter because the one that was on there looked like the original. I told him it was not the original, I replaced the original at 40,000 miles because my engine started to ping. Restricted filter and the engine runs lean, gets hot and pings. I put in a new one and no more ping. Then he told me I needed battery service because the posts were starting to show some corrosion that will cause my battery to drop cells. I told him the battery was $39.95 purchased at Walmart 5 years ago and was probably ready to be replaced anyway. He said he could perform all this service today for $279.95 and he would throw in the oil change for free. I got up on my tip toes and did a tap dance while shouting expletives as loud as I could that would have made Rodney King proud."
1,"Came here after paying 3 bucks for a standard size, slightly over cooked cupcake with store bought frosting from MOB. Was impressed with the flavor options and size of the cupcakes. Absolutely love the frosting!! Love the fact that the cupcake is serve red at room temp!! The guys are very customer service oriented. Have referred this place to several of my coworkers and my clients!!"
1,I been to the night club but it was my first time at the day club and I have to say again very classy nice and table service made it all that better
1,"Tucked away in the back of Omni on William Penn, this is a great place to grab a drink and meet up with friends. It's a little loud in the main area, but there are a couple of alcoves where you can gain some separation. Service is great and ambiance just feels like Pittsburgh. Only downside is that the drinks are a wee bit pricey.  You have been warned."
0,"My first experience at 9 Fine Irishmen was during Viva MyVegas launch week. They poured a nice cold mixed glass of Stella and Strongbow (magners perhaps)... It was enjoyed thoroughly!\n\nThe steak was good... Not great, but good... It had a bit more gristle than I was expecting, but that happens sometimes with the particular cut I chose. It was tougher though than it should have been...\n\nThe Mac and cheese was great, rich, creamy and steaming hot! The colcannon mashed potatoes however were not the greatest... and none to hot and unfortunately the waiter was gone long enough that it wasn't worth waiting to get it changed out for new stuff.... You know when mashed potatoes sit to long on a line and they get that over starched hardness... Think that, but cold, with mixed in cold uncooked cabbage and ham.  \n\nThe rest of the meal went rather well... The atmosphere was a bit darker than I would have cared for.. In fact it was hard to see the stairs... I can deal with darkness in a restaurant at the table... But the stairs, is usually a good place to keep things rather well lit. \n\nMyVegas we behind on the viva launch and had only one POS terminal setup... As such my first receipt did not have a Viva code, I talked to the waiter about the program and he gladly reprinted my receipt on a terminal with the viva integration... \n\nOverall my experience was pretty good... However nothing I would write home about, and it was below my initial expectations... I personally would go there again and give them a second chance to see if things improve. Nothing scared me off..."

0,"This nightclub is just an enormous fire hazard! I'm not sure why the architectures thought it would be cool to have a bazillion stair cases when there will be drunk people everywhere... but I hate this place! \n\nThe bouncers are dicks. On one occasion while I was on the dance floor, a couple of bouncers escorted me out to the hallway. I questioned them, asking them for a legitimate reason for why they are kicking me out. NO REASON AT ALL.\n\nObviously they had no reason to back themselves up because they didn't say anything. Is their nightclub too small to accommodate people that they have to start kicking out people from the dance floor? \n\nOne star for free drinks for girls. Otherwise, I wouldn't spend a dime on this place."
1,"I didn't really get a chance to try out much here.  I walked in during the evening hoping to grab a sandwich and apparently they don't serve sandwiches after 5pm...which I think is strange.\nWell, I had a cucumber, avocado salad with tomatoes, calamata olives, and feta cheese with a light lemon dressing.  It was SUPER TASTY!\nHope to try more next time I visit AZ"
1,"I went to a few buffet places while in Vegas and this is one of the best. We went there for dinner..and TONS of meat, veggie, and desserts...stomach was too full to try each of them. The Italian foods were the nicest, beware of : DRY SUSHI!! waste of stomach space...dry rice, dry fish. don't even bother try just because it's sushi! lol. \n\nSmoked salmons weren't fresh, too 'fishy' - they probably experienced unfinished smoking process or something? \n\nDesserts were nice! Although not authentic Frenchy stuffs, but just try the chocolate operas, yum! Not the generic stuffs you usually found in buffet places.\n\nmeats were excellent, tender, juicy, LOTS of them, and varied..pork, lamb, chicken, beef, you name it. Lots of cheesy stuffs as well. Pastas were very nice too. Salad bars were complete with every imaginable veggies you can rabbit on...but definitely not a very vegetarian place...eventhough it's probably better than one in Planet Hollywood / Monte Carlo / New York New York...\n\nNice ambiance, feels like French garden with dim lights and well heated in winter.\n\nJust don't eat the Asian stuffs...."
0,"Went here for a dinner date for my bday. I had the classic combination, a filet with your choice of shrimp, crab cake, or scallops. I chose the crab cake with filet $50. The bf had the pre-fixe menu $50 with lobster bisque, filet, and choice of side (green beans). My filet was ok. It was tender but lacked flavor. The crab cake was ok too. Full of crab meat but also off in flavor. The bf said it tasted like curry. The bf's filet had more flavor only bc he had some sort of lobster brown sauce on top. The lobster bisque was good. A little salty and hardly any lobster chunks. The green beans were basic in butter and garlic. I guess I like Asian style green beans better. Service sucked. Our server was more concerned with catering to his \""older\"" partrons versus being attentive to a young couple. I asked for a picture and he took it with my eyes closed and walked off! Barely said thank you and checked on us. Service was disappointing. Food was nothing spectacular. Won't be going back."
1,"I don't know why I haven't reviewed Opus yet--I go there probably every couple of weeks.\n\nAs a grad student, I basically limit myself to their Monday all-night happy hours, but if I were in a higher income bracket, I'd definitely go more often.  Yes, they're pricey.  But they're worth it.  I love their cocktails, both the fancy froufrou ones (for example: the Butter Up Kim--sounds horrible; peanuts in a drink?! but it is DELICIOUS; the Ryan's Baby--lemony delicious; the Cha Cha Cha, which matches my hair) and the very simple wines (which they have always obligingly let us sample before ordering) and my personal favorite: gin rickeys made with fresh-squeeze lime juice.\n\nI especially appreciate the attentive service that we have always received.  I generally go with other grad student types, and some places I get the feeling that staff don't feel we're worth their time, but that NEVER happens here.  The owner recognizes me--admittedly not hard with my hair--and she and the staff always take good care of us without being suffocating.  Last time I went, she had a headband I'd dropped there almost a month previously that they'd been hanging onto behind the bar for the next time I came in!\n\nI really enjoy the atmosphere.  I always like the music they're playing (once they played through the entire Massive Attack Mezzanine album; last time, it was something I didn't recognize but pleasantly reminiscent of mid-career David Bowie), and the seating is nice although I try to avoid the little stools at the low tables, preferring the benches.\n\nFinally, if you are looking for a good deal, you can't beat a 25% off \""martini flight\"" during happy hour.  Just ask before you order and they'll tell you what exactly you'll be getting.  It's a good way to sample new drinks and a LOT of alcohol for $12 regular price, $9 at happy hour!  Friend them on Facebook for additional special offers--last week they were doing a free drink after 8pm for fans."
1,I just had satay chicken and panang curry with shrimp.  Delicious!!!! Awesome. And they deliver so triple awesome! \n\nI have ordered from them many times now and have yet to be disappointed!
0,"As most people, we were here for a convention, the annual NATCA convention - and it's no wonder it won't be held here again.  This is a very low quality-high priced, dated hotel, despite being bought by Caesars Entertainment.  \n\nThe casino ambiance is on-par with CircusCircus; low slung ceiling with years of cigarette smoke permeating everything, acres of frumpy people glued to video gambling.\n\nRio automatically charged us an $18 per-day 'resort fee' for a closed pool and uselessly weak WiFi.\n\nThe hike to the Strip turned out to be a hassle, as Rio's shuttle drops you off at either the rear parking area of Ballys or the back parking garage of Harrahs - & you could wait 20+ minutes on either end of these no-man-lands.\n\nThere's nothing interesting in the Rio's vincinity.  We hiked across glass-strewn abandoned parking lots to the Palms Hotel, for its movie theater --that's about it.\n\nThe mediocre buffet was $30-35 dinner --$17- (kids) $25 for breakfast.\n\nFor this, our Rio room was nearly $200/night.  A low-tiered Marriott.\n\nNever again."
0,"This place is OK. the food choices is not what i thought it would be the bread is very good. i sat at the bar my waitress was a little ditzy, forgot almost everything me and my partner asked for. it was an OKAY busy night so understandable but when we even asked for menus it took about 32 mins.  but i had the pouched salmon and it was no too good the company was good and as well as the drinks. other than that i would never go again."
0,After waiting over an hour at the airport for the shuttle to arrive (alongside other guests) the shuttle finally arrived.  When I got to the hotel I walked in the doors and immediately knew I made a mistake.  There is a smell in the lobby that makes you want to shower instantly.  It only gets worse when you finally make it to your room.  Spend the extra 20.00 to stay somewhere else!
1,"Came here only for beer on Sunday night...they had plenty of beer to choose from here and the bar was barely full when I got here.  The bartenders were very welcoming and I got to see their beer menu from their iPad!  It's kind of cool although I'm not sure how they update it if one of their kegs gets changed?\n\nEven though this place seems very fine dining from the outside looking in, the bar area was very lively in terms of banter and all.  I got recommendations for post work karaoke spots as well as their favorite go-to songs to sing(one of them was Ignition Remix by R. Kelly).  \n\nIn terms of the beers that I tried, I had a very mild sour beer along with a light hefeweizen and the bartender staff helped tremendously by letting me taste some samples to help me make my decision.\n\nEven though I knew that the prices for beer in here would be higher than, say a off-Strip location, I wouldn't mind coming back here to Public House in the Venetian.  It seems fancy from the outside but it really is a comfortable place to relax and have a refreshing cold beer from their many selections."
1,It's the only place I have been able to get Pappy Van Winkle 23yr.\nNice atmosphere and relaxing.
0,"Meh. 2 stars both for food and atmosphere. Not impressed-- sushi did not taste fresh and everything was just ok. Don't waste your money ('cause it's not cheap, either). Will most likely not be back."
0,"This place has a really cool concept going, it's an awesome layout and cool beachy vibe. Unfortunately, although the food is okay, the specialty drinks are no bueno-- way too sweet and hardly a hint of tequila... a downer for a place with a separate tequila menu!  The house margarita was a smidge better, but the rrrreeeaally loud music in there (especially for a social bar / restaurant, not a dance party) made for a place I'd recommend skipping entirely."
1,"I walk into this place and WOW, I'm impressed with the styling. It's swank, sleek and modern. I was there for a corporate meal in one of their private rooms. That room was also very sexy with really cool lighting and a wavy wall design that I liked. \nThe food was good. Some appetizer munchies like calamari that was done right, a crab stuffed thingy which was really good, and an icebery wedge with delicious bacon bits and bleu cheese crumbles. I had a steak for an entree. It was perfectly cooked and had very good flavor. My bernaise sauce on the side was also very good. \nWhy not 5 stars? The price. Much like Ocean Club and Mastros, this place charges huge prices for what you get. I have no problem plunking down $100/person (not including wine) if I feel that I am getting something truly memorable. (see my review of Posh). \nBut the $20/per person premium over what I pay at Eddie V's for the exact same quality food isn't justified. \nOcean Prime's food and ambiance are superb. So are many other places in this economy competing for my dollars and they cost less. Sorry, but I will stick with Eddie V's, Flemings, Roy's, etc."
1,"Loved the welcome surprise! A sample of their cake bites on the house! We tried the strawberry shortcake and toasted coconut cupcake, the bread was delicious! Moist and flavorful! The frosting was a little sweet but with the bread it was good!"
1,"I bring all my nice clothes that never get worn which I've bought within a year & they always give me a huge chunk of change. I'm very happy, this is the only placed I have spent money on clothes in years. I always find exactly what I want & come home with amazing clothes, even in my shoe size!!!"
1,We ate here for my birthday weekend and had a great experience. The service was perfect and food was great! The creamed spinach was out of this world. I'm pretty sure it has 4000 calories per serving but it was sooo worth it! We had the crab and some oysters that were amazing as well. Recommend!!
1,"I didn't realize this place is \""brought to you by the creators of Cheesecake Factory.\""  Well that explains the good food.  I ordered a Calypso Mojito, the Rare Ahi Tuna Salad, and I shared in some of the Fudge Cake Collision.  The mojito was pretty good, the ahi tuna was amazing, and the cake was also pretty good.  Combine that with nice decor and decent service and I'd say it's worth repeat trips.\n\nI've been to the other Grand Lux inside Venetian (technically, this one is the \""other\"" Grand Lux).  I think I like the Palazzo version better simply for the layout and decor.  It feels a little more intimate."
1,Great little spot on the Strip. Cheap drinks. Beer pong tables in the back as well as fast food spots. Very conveinent after beer pong. Nice casual bar crowd & beer pong attracts younger crowd from everywhere. Live music. Some reviews are saying that it is closing down. Just when I find a great place for the common folk.
0,"Had dinner on 10/1.Mediocre at best.For appetizers we had fried calamari  and crab cakes.Calamari was ok,the marinara sauce very watery no taste.Crab cakes didn't have much crab,probably came frozen,Walmart has better ones.Ordered the 12 oz NY medium well,came out  medium rare it was ok.The 12 oz ribeye I ordered well was the thinnest ribeye I have ever seen,also fattier than most.Dinner salads were small,could have used more dressing too.Not much effort goes into the food and it shows.Service was good though."
1,"Excellent meal! We went here for my birthday dinner last night. We had an excellent bottle of Tempranillo. The paella valenciana (chicken & rabbit) was perfectly cooked. The bikini de jamon iberico was probably the best thing I've ever eaten! We also tried the rossejat (which was a pasta like version of paella). Again, another excellent dish! I would recommend sharing with 4 people because that dish was a lot for the two of us! Overall, an amazing meal with excellent service. I will return next time I am in Vegas."
0,I used to like this place except now the service with an awful sour attitude! Food is ok as compared to other nearby Mexican restaurants. I suggest going somewhere else! I highly do not recommend this place until they change service attitude!
1,"Needed a new blank transponder key (bought at ikeyless.com) to be cut and matched to the mrs. car. Getting through to the service department was a challenge, but when I did get through and talked to  Mike Santana I was able to set up a early morning appt.\n\nMike's professionalism and willingness to make sure I had a good experience here were top notch\n\nTook care of the key and also had the techs perform a courtesy check that I asked for.  Did not hard sell the scheduled maintenance that was needed.\n\nThanks Mike!"
1,"I really don't have anything negative to say about my experience here. With exception maybe of a dickhead waiter and a snippy foreign 21 dealer. Oh, and the elevators were a bit scary.\nFor the most part though, everyone did an amazing job of pretending they actually liked us. The casino staff, the desk staff, the laughably un-funny comedians and the other patrons all seemed to be actually having fun. Obviously,the whole environment was carefully crafted and calculated to keep us there and spending, but the friendly personable veneer was nearly flawless."
1,"This place is great! The bartender, Mark, is always aware of his customers. He's funny and a great guy. My food was awesome... I mean I only got chicken wings and fires and I have to say, they're better then WingStop. It was a great atmosphere. Definitely coming back."
1,Had a lot of fun! place was packed with some kind of cheerleading thing. Only waited 5 mins for a lane. That was cool with the amount of people that was there. A lot of the kids are unsupervised so ... you know how kids can get.
1,"Commenting on the steak and eggs special, Aaron says, \""Pretttty gooood\""."
0,We  were seated immediately.  The tables were very small especially when we planned to cook our meal.we first ordered two sushi rolls they came Fer the meat had arrived.  The sushi was fair . The amount of meat we got for three was may be a pound of meat .The meat was  not well seasoned . . The ri bs were got was not edible because it was so chewy. The waitress forgot our order of tea.we were very disappointed
1,"One of my most memorable dinners I gave had...ordered the 5 course prefix that is a must do. The service was impeccable, dinning room was very nice...."
0,Place seems to be going downhill. It is close to my house and next to my Safeway so our girls like it from time to time. Food has become somewhat greasy and the interior is cluttered.  \n\nThe owners need to take a close look at this place through a customer's eye. I think they might not like what they see!  In need of cleaning the place up and getting back to preparing the food the way they used to.
0,"My wife visited Ta Ta Bistro on Thursday, 2/11/2010, and I have been regularly going to Ta Ta Bistro about once or twice a month for about one year now. Normally the food is at least four stars on the Yelp scale during dinner. This time we went to lunch. I should have known when I saw we were the only ones dining (besides the employees), that maybe we should have come back later. But alas hunger prevailed. \n\nWe stayed for what we thought should have been the same quality we normally experience when we visit Ta Ta Bistro. No. Our waiter never smiled, not once! I felt like we were bothering him from the moment we sat down. Strike one. \n\nWe ordered appetizers, the snow crab tempura. Now, my wife normally orders the same thing over and over so as not to be disappointed. I of course asked her to try something new, and she did reluctantly (I'm sooooo sorry honey). The so called snow crab tempura was not at all as it seemed from the menu description. \n\nAs a loyal Ta Ta Bistro fan I must admit to being thoroughly disappointed. The menu described succulent SNOW CRAB LEGS battered in tempura and it was to be served with lemon and butter. I asked the non-smiling waiter, \""How is the snow crab tempura\""? and he said \""You know everything is always good\"" (hmmm.that should have been a clue). When they came out to the table.... (tears from reliving the moment). It was none other than Imitation \""Krab\"" with a K from the grocery store deli!!! You know the stuff you normally serve cold or put in \""Krab\""  with a K salad? \n\nI asked the non-smiling waiter what was the deal with this. I said \""this is not crab meat this is Imitation Krab with a K\"", to which he said, \""We use imitation crab in ours\"". Strike 2!! I told him the menu describes \""SNOW CRAB LEGS\""! not imitation anything. When he saw how upset we were, no apology was given he just said I take that for you, and carried off my plate of fake KRAB with a K made of Pollock not crab. \n\nNow I was worried because we had not received our Japanese lunch box with \""Rib-eye steak\"". Rib-eye is my favorite steak. He did not serve me rib-eye. It was that cheaper cut of meat used for pepper steak. Strike 3!!! And of course it was pre-sliced and drenched in terriyaki so who's gonna argue with that it's rib-eye. I know the texture of Rib-eye. It is not a gelatinous tendon filled meat ever. \n\nNeedless to say I am very disappointed in Ta Ta Bistro. Very, very, very, disappointed. It raises the question if the SNOW CRAB LEGS & THE RIB-EYE STEAK were imitation what else is imitation? I hope they get it together soon. \n\nPlease keep in mind I normally call over the manager when things go good or really good. And I would have called over the manager for this incident but the non-smiling waiter was keeping him informed the whole time, so there was no need. Needless to say it will be a while before we have the stomach or nerve to go back."

1,"I have been to many of the fancy suites in Vegas and around the world.  The Parlor Suite we stayed in last week was incredible.  All the attention at the Suites Tower and the perfection of the room was superb!\n\nAs everything Steve Wynn touches, it is pure perfection!  All the beautiful decor,  great restaurants, the incredible stores, the golf course, spa, and our suite made us feel so special that I am looking forward to coming back again and again.\n\nThe Ferrari museum/dealership and store were incredible-if you're into that kind of stuff (as I am).  \n\nThe best pools of any Vegas hotels.  It's not just a pool area, it's also a beautiful European garden.  Everything is classy and elegant.  The staff are super helpful and friendly.\n\nLe Reve, I've seen it twice now and it's still an amazing show!!!\n\nLooking forward to coming back!!!  Thank you, Wynn!!!"
0,"Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car. I checked and they cleared the code right before I bought the car. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW!! Never ever go to this dealership, They lie just to get you to buy a car."
1,"Best chicken fingers I've had.  Other options in the Valley can get close (i.e. Raising Cane's) but this place is unparalleled.\n\nThis is a really small place, about as local as it gets - so feel good about spending your money here!  Talk up the owner and bring your friends - he'll hook you up with extra sauce or an extra finger."
1,What an amazing view of the Bellagio hotel. This restaurant is so nice and very romantic with its dimmed lights and wonderful view of the fountain.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and had tons of information to give us about every item we ordered. I enjoyed my meal here and the service was great. I will visit again.
1,Stopped by to pick up dinner. Wait time was about 15-20 min but definitely worth the wait. Ordered a couple of pupusas and platanos fritos to go and they were made fresh which is why there was a small wait time. I would recommend calling ahead if planning to pick up an order. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself was really clean. Ended up being a great dinner option and paid less then 15 dollars for 2 people! Very affordable and with every penny.
1,I have used this place for 3 times for graduations for my kids. Easy people to work with. They come to school so you can order it right there or you can go on line. Everybody was always very nice and polite. \nI have never had the need to go into the store with any of my kids. 2 of them I ordered on line. One at the school. Super easy.\n I think the other reviews are haters.
0,The teens who work here are quite rude. Wasn't expecting much for the few items I had but the service was terrible. I was the only customer in the store when I walked in and they stayed behind the counter the whole time.
0,"I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS!!!! I wish my two bridesmaids who went here would have done their research because this has been a nightmare!!!! First off the dresses were ordered nearly 9 weeks ago and 3 weeks ago my bridesmaids were told the dresses were \""lost\"" they kept blaming Alfred Angelo even though Alfred Angelo said the dresses were already shipped. So for 3 weeks after going back and forth with the dumb manager and whoever else works there my fiance had to take over and forced the owner to give him the UPS tracking number... after looking at the activity with the tracking number it turns out the dresses were NOT lost but had been attempted to be delivered 3 different times but every time they tried to deliver them the store did not have the payment for the delivery even though the dresses were paid in full already!! I am so angry and so confused as to how a company can function and stay open like this! They are so unhelpful and rude! Supposedly tonight the manager is going to the UPS hub to pick up the dresses so my bridesmaids can pick them up tomorrow.. with my wedding less than 3 weeks away I sure hope this is true! I will believe it when I see it. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Stopped in this place with a large party at dinner time, all needing separate checks, expecting the worst and was so, so pleasantly surprised!  They've got about a million local beers on tap, and our waiter was fantastic and brought samples of beers before we committed to ordering them.  The fried cheese curds were delicious, as were both of the cheese plates that my table ordered.  I ordered one of the specials for dinner-a really delicious BLT made with local tomatoes and served with a HUGE side salad.  (I'm usually prepared to be disappointed with the size or quality of a side salad, but this one had dark leafy greens, a tangy vinaigrette, and was beautifully fresh).  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."
1,"To start with this is place that isnt for those interested in the Ambiance,,, but for good food. Ive been going to this location for well over 5 years now on saturdays while I visit the car show.  I have never had a bad episode concerning the quality of the food, the employees or anything that restrict my decision to eat here,  The people here are interested in you, they want you to return. they guide you upon your initial visit unto how the process works.  Yes the food will cook and shrink down but there is  not limit to howe much you can put into your bowl. they even offer wax papers to use to push your food down into the bowl.\nThe qualitty of the food is good. I see them use gloves when handling food, I have seen the foods being stored in refrigeration unit.  and by the looks of the huge steaming grill they use with water to cook your food.  I could most definately say that its over 165 degree and I have never been sick. Im confident you will enjoy this place. and the leftovers are even great at 3am\nthey treat you more than a client but are actually hospitible and freindly."
1,Excellent place to try different beers
1,"I Love This Place, it is so good without being stuffy....."
0,"We hadn't been here for several years and got a coupon so decided to try again for dinner .  First impression - DARK!   Seriously, so dark we can't read the menu (servers had to provide flashlights) and then could barely see our food.  Food was OK, but a bit pricey for what we got and service was a bit slow and sporadic.  We got a sopapilla for desert and it was strangely salty and sweet.  Overall, \""Meh\"" was our reaction.  Probably won't be back."
1,"Basis has become one of my new favorite places to eat. I've been there twice, and both times had a great experience. \n\nFirst, the bread they bring to the table comes with 2 different flavored butters (one is a pesto i believe, one is a spicy chili). I could just eat that alone.\n\nAppetizers are also great - i've had the shrimp mango quesedillas as well as the poblano chili mac and cheese (with bacon!) and the wonton tacos.\n\nBoth times I have been to Basis I had fish - the shrimp Po Boy sandwich and last night the grilled fish sandwich. They come with your choice of sides, but i have always picked sweet potato fries, which are awesome.\n\nPrice wise it is on the more pricey side of the scale, but not too bad.\n\nRecommend this place highly!"
0,": I really wish there were a nursery that could compete w/ their tree selection.  It became apparent after they planted our three fruit trees a few months ago that they'd injured the apple tree w/ a giant pole they drove through the roots (to keep the trunk straight, they said, unlike the apple tree we'd purchased there the previous year and planted ourselves.  Irony?  We'd chosen that apple, and it was curved when we bought it.  Furthermore, they were only supposed to plant the other two trees.  If we'd have planted the new apple, as planned, it wouldn't be struggling to survive, right now).\n\nMore than anything, the experience reminds me to be assertive and complain about terrible service, and to look elsewhere before buying any more trees from these people.\n\n(Edit:  Apple tree died.)"
1,"i love the pizza here they give plenty of cheese and toppings,not the healthiest food but when i need something that taste awesome i go order the 8.99 one topping carry out pizza usually with chicken or beef"
1,"I love Chicago hot dogs. I have loved them since I was a wee girl. Therefore, any place that makes a real deal, Vienna beef, loaded Chicago dog is aces in my book. \n\nIs Matt's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? No. Is Matt's the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future."
0,"I have gone to this place for years and USED to really love it.  I still love the atmosphere, but the food has gone WAY down hill.  If your looking for great decor, friendly staff and poor food this is your place.\n\nSeems that they are resting on their fame now only."
0,"This place is Disgusting!!! Rice is Overcooked, tasted like a baby food \nMy California Rolls did not even looked like ones. Lunch menu was way too small for the price. \nAll-You-Can eat was a disaster. It took them 45 min to bring second order of rolls which we could not even eat, because they had NO Taste !!! Service is way too slow as well their chefs which I think would make a much better job cooking Salsa. \nSave your time and money and try to stay away from that Sushi JOKE Place!!!"
1,"Our one \""must stop\"" place in Vegas. No matter where we stay, we have to have a Grimaldi's pizza. This branch is right between our two favorite hotels, so...score!\n\nPerfect thin crust New York pizza. The wait staff has always been friendly and fun, and the food is worth a 3.5 hour drive. Get a basic pizza and stop with all the California crap. Ranch dressing for a pizza? Please. Good beer, good salad, excellent pie. What more do you need?"
1,"Was in Scottsdale for an overnight trip and decided to stop by this place to have some dinner and watch the Suns vs Lakers game.  The joint is a really nice sports bar and grill....I've never been to a sports bar that was so nice before, I thought I had the wrong place when I arrived.  The restaurant is well kept and looks like it just opened, at least by the cleanliness and decor.\n\nSince I was alone, I saddled up to the bar and decided to eat and have a few Beers while I watched the game.  The menu is pretty extensive, so I asked the bartender for her recommendation.  She suggested the Boneless Wings ($7.99) or the Sliders ($7.99 + $.50 w/Cheese).....I said, \""What the hell, let's go for both!\"".  I asked her to make sure the Boneless Wings were really Spicy.  Since I had been in China for the past 10 days I was in the mood for some heat.....she said that their hottest wing sauce wasn't that hot....but that the cooks could whip up  a Habanero Sauce for me.  I asked her to have the Boneless Wings prepared with Hot Sauce and put the Habanero Sauce on the side, just to be on the safe side, LOL.  To wash it down, I had a 22 oz SunUp Trooper IPA ($5.50).\n\nI watched the Lakers vs Suns game for a while and made some new friends at the bar while I waited for my food.  After a short wait the first dish to come out was the Boneless Wings.  The Habanero Sauce was so Hot that when they placed it down in front of me I choked on the fumes....and this was with the Sauce on the Side!  I had to move the plate off to the side, just so I could breathe....perfect!  I took one piece of Boneless Wing, dipped it into the Habanero Sauce, and took a bite....wow, it packed a big punch!  Very spicy and soooo good!  The Chicken was moist and juicy and cooked just right.....not too crunchy and not too soft....and full of flavor.\n\nThe Sliders came out a few minutes later....so I left 1/2 my Wing order to go try the Sliders.  There were 4 Sliders on the plate.  I tried it with a little Blue Cheese Dressing.....yum!  Then I dipped them in a little Blue Cheese then with the Habanero Sauce that came with the Wings....even better!  I told the bartender to tell the cooks that their Habanero Sauce was a huge hit and to thank them for me.\n\nIt took me a while, but I devoured everything I ordered.  2 IPA's later and with a Lakers' loss in the making, I asked the bartender to change up the Beer order and asked for her recommendation.  She suggested the 4 Peaks Peach Ale (22 oz $5.50)....ok, I normally don't do Peach flavored Beer but went with it anyway.  I'm glad I did, it had a nice smooth finish and you could barely taste the Peach flavor....it didn't overwhelm the brew.\n\nDespite a Lakers loss, I had a great time and meal here.  Kudos to the staff for making a patron happy by whipping up a spicy Habanero Sauce on the fly....you can almost feel the heat in the pics I took.\n\nWill I return?  You bet I will!"
0,"Poor service. I ordered food with 4 friends and my food never came. I was reassured by our server that the food was on it's way, but I eventually cancelled my order because my friends were finishing their meal. How long does it take to make an omelet? Clearly, my order was lost in the disorganization. Is this the type of over priced restaurant you want to support with your hard earned money?\nI'm a local and will never be back nor will I bring my guest to this place."
1,Good beer and good music.
1,"Rien de compliqu\u00e9 mais les tacos sont chauds et biens garnis.  Ce qui est selon moi le \"" high light\"" de la soir\u00e9e est l'excellent service qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 prodigu\u00e9 par Rena.  Celui ci \u00e9tait juste dans tous les sens et il vaut certainement une \u00e9toile a lui seul."
1,"I've been to this location and the location in Chicago a few times, and has been a home run each time!\nI will say, that i tried Joe's scallops this time, and wasnt a big fan. I don't like the flour dusted layer on them. I loooooove the taste of scallops, and felt it took away from the great flavour. But otherwise everything else at the table was soooo gooood!\n\nMy Mom had the dover sole, which had tremendous table side service. They fileted the fish right at the table, and not a single bone to be found!\n\nGreat wine list too! \nWe reserved through Open Table and very lucky we did! The place was rammed by 5:30pm! Definitely recommend reservations!"
0,Rude employee. I ordered sub and sat down to eat and was asked to leave cause they were closing right at 9:00 pm. You could have said something when I was paying and not be so rude about it. I will not be returning to this location where there is no customer service. Smh
0,"First of all, they don't serve peanut butter cupcakes on Saturday. Second, I've had better, like when I make my own cupcakes. I ordered the chocolate cheesecake cup cake and it tastes like a big mess of chocolate sugar. If I concentrate, I can kind of taste the cheese that should be In the cake."
0,"I feel like this place is starting to take short cuts.  The Mac and cheese which I usually love from here was not as good the last couple of times.  The chicken didn't even taste like it was smoked.  Green beans were bland...maybe from a can.  The smoked sausage with pimento was still good, but anything is good drowned in cheese.  I am kind of afraid to go back because the last two times were so disappointing."
0,"Good was disappointing, bread was flavorless, service was incredibly slow. Patio is lovely but doesn't make up for the slow service."

0,"I was a little thrown back at the fact the head host carried a long lengthy conversation with a gentleman who walked up to her the same time that I did. She didn't even acknowledge the fact that I was waiting there by myself. \n\nThe waiter who assisted us was friendly, however he messed up our order by giving us two foie gras pate, when we asked for the pan seared foie gras. It wasn't that much of a big deal to me, so I didn't want to bring attention to it. However, my filet mignon wasn't up to my expectations. It was too salty... a little too much sodium intake for me. Overall, I would say that SW was okay. If you asked me if I would visit again- I would, but probably prefer sitting outside with the beautiful lighting, and not deal with the rude hostess."
0,I was so excited for this authentic Thai restaurant and was sorely disappointed. The only good thing we had was the Thai beef jerky. Everything else was unmemorable as I literally can't remember what else we ordered.  Very greatly disappointed =(
1,"We visited Bobby Q for the first time this week. The food and service was great. We ordered the ribs, chicken and brisket. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The brisket was tender and cooked perfectly. Our waiter was very attentive. We will definitely go back!"
1,"Seriously, thank GOD for Kevin. I was having major problems with my BMW. After going to 3 different mechanics who jerked me around and ripped me off for $2k, I was about to give up and buy a new car. Then my friend told me about BenZtek.  My car was at 3 different shops for nearly three weeks and it was still having the same issues. Kevin fixed my car in less than an hour for an unbelievable price and I never had any problems since. Don't waste your time at any other shops! He is the best!!"
0,"I completely agree with ALL of the negative reviews on this school.  I was an instructor for this college from June 2013 to February 2014.  I worked at the Tempe campus under an amazing director!  He left and an awful woman named Cheryl with a really BAD reputation took over.  She was a bully, she set out to completely get rid of all of the best instructors, myself included.  My students respected me and loved my classes. When she pointed her nasty finger at me to get rid of me the students wrote letters and begged her to keep me.  She punished them for it.  \nThe school has since lost all of their great instructors because of this horrible person.  Ive moved on to a happier college with a great team of people I can respect.  I just feel bad for the students that got ripped off.  I cared about each and every one of them.  Shame on Brookline.  Students be warned!!  Go to another school! ANY other school."
1,"Yummy breakfast, huge portions, great price point.\n\nI had an omelet (I like mine a bit underdone) and it was perfection. My BFF had the corned beef hash.\n\nThe service is exceptional, even when they are slammed. I can see why locals love this chain/place."
0,"This design showroom on South Tryon had some very interesting lighting pieces, but too outlandish for me in both taste and price. I found them to be WAY too expensive; even small hangings were a fortune, anywhere from $500 - $1000 and more. They are all very modern pieces, most are very large. If you are into contemporary design and are looking to make a statement, and have way too much money to spend on a lighting fixture, take a look in here. Just be sure to duck - I'm only 5'1 and I almost hit my head a few times."
0,Worst airline ever!
1,Went with a small group of 4.. The place looked pretty busy but they were able to get us in it right away. Food was delicious! I had a carne asada quesadilla. It was about $18 (to me that's expensive for such a simple dish). Service was slow that's the only downside. Had to wait for the server to come back around because he barely checked on us. I'm a local and would I go back? Probably not unless a friend wanted me to for a special occasion. Don't get me wrong it tasted good. But I just don't want to pay for an overpriced quesadilla and I don't want to wait 20 minutes for water. Thanks just me though. Servers were nice.

1,"So brunch buffets are as synonymous with Las Vegas as Lebron is to basketball, and there is a whole lot of winning going on at the Sterling Brunch in the Bally's Hotel and Casino. Tucked in the back of the ground floor of Bally's in the BLT Steak restaurant rests one of the newest, and I will say it, finest brunch buffets in Las Vegas.\n\nNow it isn't called the \""Sterling\"" Brunch for no reason, it costs, it costs big time.\n\nMost of us are not willing to pay $90 per person for brunch, but because of the high quality of seafood, meats and champagne that they serve, I must admit, the price tag is justified. I usually avoid buffets in general as quantity is NOT what gets me hard, it's the quality, and the Sterling Brunch has both.\n\nWhen you are seated you are immediately served two Gruyere popovers. For those of you who are new to popovers, as I was, they are an American version of English Yorkshire pudding. They are baked custard in muffin tins, but the inside is not dense, it is very light and moist. It was pretty insane. It was as if the crispy shell was basted for hours with liquefied cheese as the flavor of the Gruyere was wonderfully powerful. Slather some sea-salted butter on the inside and you are ready to party.\n\nAs a start for brunch, or any meal for that matter, it doesn't get better than this.\n\nNext up was the buffet. On my first round I focused solely on seafood, the options were far and wide in this category alone. Baked lobster tail, King crab legs, crab claws, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cakes.\n\nUm, yes.\n\nOut of all of them I recommend the baked lobster tail and the King crab legs the most, the quality of them were excellent and the flavors were good and rich. Skip the crab cake. It will take up too much valuable real estate; not to mention it kinda blows.\n\nNow the offering of caviar is one of the major reasons this brunch stands out. That, and the unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne (a $50/bottle value). Though the caviar is American Amia (bowfin roe from Louisiana), which, though quiet common and inexpensive, is still a buffet rarity and presented with blinis, cr\u00e8me fraiche, capers and finely diced red onion so you feel, well, spoiled. Regardless.\n\nEgg me, baby.\n\nThe caviar is just one of the many items offered on their menu outside of the buffet options. We ordered the Caesar salad, tuna tartar, the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster bisque; the bisque was a bit more like a bouillabaisse but still yummy.\n\nNow, they also offer filet mignon, truffled mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as well as lamb chops so one can get their steakhouse on.\n\nI sampled them as a dessert substitute because, well, I've always been more of a salt guy than a sugar dude. But alas my stomach could hold no more, but if one were so inclined, and has a larger stomach muscle than my own, feel free to polish off those dishes as well because they are good times.\n\nAdeye took the trip down Dessert Ave.  It's one of the prettiest avenues I have seen and she seemed very pleased.\n\nSterling Brunch. You have raised the brunch bar so high we could barely get our legs and bellies over it. Congratulations for redefining the Vegas buffet for those of us who care about quality."
0,"Well this is the last time ordering from this place, one of the workers  who's name was \""Cary\"" very rudely over the phone said it would take over 2 hours to diliver our pizza after running our creddit card, I asked for a refund, the girl hung up on me, I called back and was guaranteed a pizza within the next couple of hours. Nearly 3 hours went by and there was no pizza dilivered. I called back they said they decided not to put in any order. I asked for a refund again and was told I won't get one until 2 weeks have passed. I won't recommend  ordering from here to anyone they have the worst customer survice  ever to be provided to the public. They just lost a customer"
1,"I'm seriously giving this place a 5 star rating not because it's perfectly laid out  -- Woodman's East is really a dump. However this place has an insane variety of groceries and seriously has prices that are low, and by low, I mean lower than an Asian grocer.\n\nAnother really surprising aspect of this particular Woodman's is the variety of ethnic groceries. I have never seen chow pei yu sold in any place besides an Asian market, but this place has it. Basmati Rice is about half the price of whatever I get in Milwaukee (the city, not the street) and the beer selection in both Woodman's is incredible. Seriously, where else can you find Augustiner Br\u00e4u in Madison (or in practically any place in the U.S.)? You might think Riley's, but no, it's in good ol' Woodman's liquor section.\n\nMy real issue with Woodman's East is the frozen veggie section, which is quite lacking and not as cheap as the one in the west. Their tea selection is also lacking too. Both Woodman's stores have pretty bad seafood selection, but if you're looking for cheap and plentiful anything else, this place is it."

0,Well known upscale Italian restaurant that is quite inconsistent. I have had great meals but recently a very mediocre dining experience. Waitstaff were uninspiring and simply went through the motions. There are many places to choose from on the Vegas strip that will give you a better dining experience.
1,"The last time I remember going to the doctor was after NYE 1998. I was celebrating the coming New Year with friends in our favorite bar in Detroit, Michigan, when I finished a mouthful of shrimp and told my BFF Ricky 'I don't feel well.' My next memory was being surrounded by a bunch of over-animated queens who could barely conceal their snarky attitudes because I was the shit and I ruled that part of town. I spent the rest of the evening in Ricky's car turning the engine on to melt the frost on the windows. Well, after we made it back to Ohio the next day, Ricky told my parents what happened and they made me go to the doctor. Something about thinking my epilepsy had returned. However, after several tests and a few thousand dollars out of pocket, they couldn't tell me what had happened and concluded it was just a fainting spell. \n\nSo, clearly, I was hesitant about going to a doctor once I moved out to Arizona and hadn't made any appointments with a doctor for about 8 years. Sadly, I developed a painful ear ache and was left with no choice, after almost 2 months of self-medicating, but to schedule an appointment with a doctor. Since I'm generally lazy and look for the easiest way out of something, I found the addresses of fie general practitioners covered by my insurance in our ZIP code, mapped out which was accessible by light rail, by light rail and one bus transfer and by walking distance during a pleasant month in Phoenix. That's how I decided to go to Dr. McRunels. \n\nI was feeling a little uneasy about seeing a stranger and having to go through my medical history (back home, we went to the same doctor who delivered us so he was kind of along for the journey of our lives). But the staff and Dr. McRunels dissipated any concerns by being professional yet friendly. This wasn't what I was expecting. Even though I had gone for my ear ache, they were willing to discuss any other medical concerns I may have, whether my body was functioning any differently in the past few years, if I developed any new moles, and other conditions that may have presented themselves in the years since I last had a thorough exam. \n\nNot surprisingly, I survived the appointment and was able to fill my prescription at Target in 20 minutes. \n\nNow I can call my mom and let her know I now have my own doctor!"
0,"I used to come here a few years ago when i was working in the area, the group would like to meet here for lunch occasionally.\n\nI haven't been back in a while and a few weeks ago I was craving chinese food but I wanted variety, I decided to stop in and get a take-out box.  \n\nIt's hard to gauge what to expect when anything is sold by the pound, a lot of things are sold by the pound but that doesn't necessarily mean they're good.\n\nfor example, Dog Food, Fertilizer, Nuts, Fruit, Candy, Gold Ingots, Seafood, Horse Hair, Cookies, Soap, Coffee, Turkey, Building Materials, Meat Products, Olives, Scrap Metal, Uranium and apparently Chinese Food.\n\nI filled up a take-home box and didn't feel I was overstuffing the box or having any difficulty closing the box, but apparently this was 2.4 pounds of food and was over $10 for some cheap takeout.  I'm somewhat convinced they use MSG and ingredients that make the food literally heavier.\n\nNot wanting to give up, a friend and I stopped by here last weekend to eat lunch and dined in. the items on the buffet aren't bad and scratch the itch.  But everything is mediocre as you would expect buffet food to be.\n\nthe 1 star comes from how the food made me sick that evening, and made me feel nauseous for most of the night.  I will most likely not be back."
0,"I would have to agree with previous reviews in that it's a unique and fun store, but I too have been treated very rudely by employees.  Not only do they sometimes look at you and not say hello, but when you go to purchase something they barely acknowledge you then too.  I've gone back to give them various chances, but they are not exactly warm or inviting unless you are a 50 year old, upper class woman doing some damage.  It's rather unfortunate."
1,Great place. Attentive wait staff. Very good tasty food. Nice atmosphere. Had papaya salad and curry with chicken. Delicious. Excellent value.
1,Great food with okay service \nThe drink menu has great drinks and is very creative. Worth it. The service is okay at best.
1,I love the workers at this location. Always friendly and helpful!!!   Pita Jungle is delish!
1,Love the food. Plus I accidentally left my credit card and they called and held it for me until the next day. Great customer service
0,"The food was just okay. After reading all the great reviews I was quite excited to try some new Italian food! \n\nMaybe I came on a bad night but the flavor of the food was just okay. The flavor consistently fell short from the Caesar salad to the chicken parm. \n\nThe service was warm and welcoming and had an authentic feel to it. \n\nOverall, not impressed and I almost certainly will not be back."
1,"I am so glad I discovered this place last night. They have very good traditional-style tacos with great late-night specials, and there is a toppings bar so you can dress up your tacos any way you want. The employees are super friendly and even with a line, the wait for your food doesn't take long. The venue is very simple but the food so I wouldn't come here on a special occasion, but if you are just looking for some good, cheap tacos, this is your spot."
1,"Never have I felt the need to review a Walgreen's, but when you're on vacation, nearby drugstores become your best friend and in-hotel drugstores are even better! \n\nThis place is everything the reviewers say it is: crowded, somewhat expensive, and extremely convenient.\n\nWe put together a decent supper of nacho cheese dip, tortilla chips, and microbrewery beer, for about $15.00. The atmosphere was like a frat party--loud and excited. The staff were very kind, considering."
1,"Love this place! Great burgers, and amazing shakes. We've been going here for years and years, it's a must stop if you are in or going through Wickenburg. try the pineapple shake and of course a cheeseburger!"
0,"I typically like the berto places but they certainly range from location to location.  This one is NOT a good one.\n\nTry Filberto's a mile down the road on 30th street and Indian (newly remodeled and clean, they also give you chips while you wait) or Armando's on 36th and Thomas.\n\nThese rec's of course are limited only to Berto's type of places.  If your not in a hurry the list changes entirely."

Our pets our family he saved and with much patience explains everything going on with our \""girls\"" the senior staff dr nick and the grooming staff have been wonderful. Dr. Brown operated on one of our girls and  with his expertise is running jumping (which got her into trouble in the first place) and back to herself ! 5 stars aren't enough"
1,"\""You want a piece of me?\"" said the gargantuan mango tango eggees cup.

0,"I just left there with a couple of my friends. It was unbelievable they said that their computer went down so they messed up our order . Honestly people who came way after us got their order . We kept on reminding them but all they gave us was were working on it. After an hour of waiting for noodles, we decided to pay for our drinks  and appetizers and leave . Can you imagine being hungry, cold, and ignored. Sorry but I am going back to Shoyu where you're always welcome and appreciated."
1,"Okay, I wanted to give Pinot Brasserie only 3 stars for the insulting escargot but because of how well they treated us I bumped them up to four.\n\nI ate here for lunch. My friend and I shared an appetizer and entree. I ordered the escargo, and he ordered the leek tart.\n\nMy escargo was bland. Bland Escargo!? Really? It was so bland that I scooped up some of the butter from my bread and put in with the sauce. It helped, but I was still disappointed.  \n\nThe leek tart and side salad, on the other hand, was delish! The balsamic dressing they use was to die for.  While our waiter came to speak with us we dropped the whole Culinary students thaang on him and he told us that he had gone to Le Cordon Blue....we got a good laugh because the pastry teacher he had transferred to our school, and we had fun picking on him.\n\nLater when we were done he gave us our check and told us that management would like to buy us a desert. I looked at my friend as said,\""It is my birthday, why not?!\""  He gave us the desert menu.  Creme brulee? Ive done it a million times, Cheesecake? Can get it anywhere. Souflee? Would take too long.....but, oh whats this? Roasted strawberries with a balsamic reduction infused with mint and vanilla, served with fog goat cheese?! I'm there.\n\nWe ordered it, and soon the waiter came out telling us that management would like to buy us each a glass of wine to pair with our desert. \n\nYes please!\n\nI don't know wines yet, (give me another year to start on that) but it was a sparkling wine that went perfect with the AWESOME desert. Woah! Those flavors blew me away!\n\nWould I eat there again? Maybe. If I have the same 2 gentlemen, and I would have to avoid the escargot. Hmmph."
0,"I don't even know where to start with this place. I used to love the Scottsdale location, and when it opened up down in Chandler I was more than excited. The service went way downhill when Steve left. I continued to go as they really do have great food. On average, we would bring in 10-20 people. On a weekly basis most of the time. We'd have going away parties, birthday parties, you name it. \n\nWhen I knew it was getting bad- I went in to pick up lunch for my team at work. They told me I couldn't get a to go order (I'm sorry, what?) per the chef. The server ended up ringing in the order normally so I could get my food. I waited AN HOUR.  If it was even the slightest bit busy, I'd understand. Trust me, it wasn't.\n \nI gave them another chance.  After a friend ordered something that was nothing like she thought it would be the server said she couldn't take it off. We asked to talk to the owner, and the server said, \""are you sure? She's in a terrible mood\"". The owner refused to take it off the bill saying \""this isn't a tasting menu\"". That $8 roll was that important compared to our $200 tab.  She then proceeded to tell us to \""f*ck off\"".\n\nFor some asinine reason, a year later we return to give it another shot. The server was very nice. Towards the end of our stay, we saw the owner loudly talking to another customer, and pointing at us. We became very uncomfortable, so we left. As we were leaving, a host came running out. In a very sarcastic and obnoxious tone said, \""HAVE A GREAT NIGHT\""\n\nHow this place is still in business is amazing. This is NOT how you treat paying customers. I know the owner has multiple restaurants around the valley.  SHE alone is destroying such an awesome concept. Don't be in this business if you hate it."
0,"Okay, so, my first meal in Montreal, this is a famous vegetarian/vegan place in town.  The wait was not very long, about 20 minutes, but hey, must be good!  The food was actually good but not amazing.  The sandwiches are a bit blend, needs seasoning, even for vegan you need seasoning.  They did gave us some dipping sauce for the sandwiches, but how does that work with sandwiches which aren't even in a torpedo shape?  I got an shake to go with my meal.  I was starving and had to get some sort of protein.\n\nOverall, the experience was a bit rushed and crowded but the food justified the wait.  \n\nHere's my horrible experience with the hostess.  She should not be a hostess at this restaurant.  I'm a Canadian myself, but lives and works in the US.  At the counter, I handed my american $20 bills to the hostess to pay for the meal.  Her first reaction was \""This bill is fake!\""  I said what?  What do you mean by fake?  She claim the graphic design on the american $20 bill is fake.  I assume she was joking with me so I laughingly told her the bill is an older version of the new bill.  Its still valid, just was printed in the 1970s not the year 2000.  She then yelled at me called me a liar and ran off into the kitchen (the restaurant is crowded and loud).  Leaving me, my friends, and the poor waitress staring at each other blindly.  The waitress said \""sorry.\"" and smiles and sneaks away.  I then pulled out my other $20 USD with the UPDATED graphics.  The hostess came back and I handed her the $20 USD bills.  She stared at them and examines them with her high tech possibly racist eyes.  She stared at me and angrily shelved me the change.  \nBy this point I'm ragingly angry.  I was determined to get her fired, but my boyfriend talked me out of acting as silly as the hostess.  I walked to the waitress and gave her a $10 CND for tip, since she was so nice to us.  Then we left.  \n\nAbout 6 blocks later, I realized the hostess gave me back the wrong change, she had given me $10 CND short of change.  At that moment I had to decide whether I should make the rest of my trip about getting her fired or enjoying Montreal with my fellow french canadian friends.  I chose the third option, yelp."
1,It's so pretty in here. They have a good selection but everything is pricey. If you don't have a Fry's rewards card I suggest getting one. We used my aunt's number since we don't live in AZ. At least this way she'll get the fuel points and I got the discount.

0,"We took a friend out to celebrate her birthday, which we mentioned to our waiter. We waited 25-30 minutes for our order to arrive, with no bread basket to nibble on while waiting & starving. Bread costs an extra 5.00 (approx)! When food finally arrived, my Mussels were in an abundance of delicious sauce, but no bread or rice to soak it up. Instead, French Fries, which although delicious, did nothing to soak up the cup of sauce. My husband ordered a rare burger, which came only slightly pink, not rare. The chocolate cake came without a birthday candle or song & was not given as a gift, as most every restaurant  does. Chintzy right down the line.... Almost impossible to hear/be heard without pantomiming & yelling over the constant loud background din.\nDecor gorgeous though, & our waiter friendly & knowledgeable..."
0,"This pains me to write, however we did NOT have a good first experience. And after my extreme excitement about the opening, I'm extra disappointed!  My husband went to pick up food, ordered everything correctly, exactly as he and I wanted it, gladly waited 10 min for the food, drove home and realized there were many things missing...  That ended up being just the beginning of our trouble!  I had the receipt in hand and called asking to speak to a manager. The lady who answered the phone, Carla, said she was the manager, so I told her that we didn't receive items we had paid for, to which she told me she would be glad to give me the items if we came in to get them right then and there. However we live far from the location and my husband was not going to drive all the way back out there. She then told me that was all she could do, that it was company policy there were no other options. I asked if she could take my name and leave a credit of some sort in the office or behind the register, anything other than us driving back out there or just eating the money. To which she said, \""no\"".  That is when I got upset. As a Chicagoan who had been waiting for this restaurant to open, I was beyond disappointed to be treated like this!  She told me there was no proof the burger was missing other than for us to bring all our food, (that we had already unwrapped,) back to the restaurant. So I said, \""isn't there an extra burger laying around?\""  She instantly replied, \""no.\""  I then asked for her full name and the phone number to corporate because I was so upset that my husband wasn't going to be able to eat and that as new, potentially loyal customers, we were being treated in this manner.  She then asked me to tell her my ticket number again and read to her word for word what was on my receipt. In other words she assumed I was lying trying to get something for free and needed me to recite the list word for word in order to verify I was telling the truth...  All over a $6 burger!!  Here's a tip, you are a new restaurant in town, make your customers happy even if it means losing $6 down the road rather than arguing back and forth with them for 7 minutes while the food they DO have is getting cold!!  After I did the required song and dance Carla put me on hold and came back telling me she magically discovered there WAS an extra burger at the grill, verifying that when I proposed the idea to her 5 minutes prior she had answered without actually checking!!  At that point she asked for my name and phone number and told me that there would be a note behind the register under my name to give me all the items, in addition to the burger, that were missing for free on my next visit. After all that nonsense I could finally get down to eating the food I had been waiting months for!  The bread on both the hot dogs in our order was stale. Other than that, the hot dogs themselves had a nice snap, the fries were good, probably would have been upgraded to great with the cheese I ordered and paid for and the beef was ok... I will be back to receive our missing items for sure...  As for after that is TBD. Sad first experience!"
1,No a bad place. Their barbacoa is good and so are their margaritas. I love their tortilla soup.
0,"Been here several times over the years and have never been impressed. \n\nThe waiters are slow and unresponsive. \n\nThe food is mediocre and has always taken a long time to reach the table.\n\nFor example, once ordered a steak, asked for medium rare but got well-done, so I sent it back. The waiter was hesitant but took it to the kitchen. After coming back, the waiter was argumentative and said the chef said that is how it is supposed to be. \n\nPaid the overpriced bill and left. Don't care to return, which is a shame because I like the ambiance and want to support local restaurants."
0,"Wow! The bell hop said we couldnt use a cart, like it was his property, so after carrying a boat load of stuff,  I had to put something down briefly, in like 1 minutes time another hotel guest came up and stole it!! When I went to talk to security, the guy was acting like a complete jerk, coping a major attitude. \nI told him I didnt want to argue with him and would appreciate it if the manger called me, he took down my number and I never got a return call for the 4 days I stayed.  \nDuring my stay, I also previously stayed at The Riviera, who only charged me only $30 to get a late check out at 6pm!!!  Excalibur wanted $40 and wanted me out by 3pm!  \nI also did alot of gambling and was never offered a drink, the entire time. The view room is considered a room staring at the back of the castle, can't even see any of the strip. \nI said I was never going to stay there again when I visited in march, yet I found myself there again, so once again, I will never stay there again... And I mean it this time!!"
1,"This place makes the best burger in Phoenix and the price is very reasonable. I'm also very found of their hot and spicy chicken sandwich. My only complaint is that some of their new staff members just aren't as sharp as the old schoolers. I've been a loyal chuckbox customer since 2002 and I really miss some of the old faces. That said, you still can't beat the burgers...or the price."
1,"This place is great. It's like a cross between a fast-food and a regular restaurant.  It has a really casual upscale fast-food atmosphere, and the food is really fresh and delicious!\nIt has become one of my favorite places for a quick bite."
1,These guys are honest and very nice. Had them do my total engine in my Saleen and they did it right. Honest and I refer everyone to them to everyone.
1,I love this place. The caramelized onion and sausage pizza is so good! The pasta and salad is good to. I usually order pizza and a pasta or salad dish and take home what I dont eat. Small place but nice and food comes out really quick. I want to say more about this place cause my review seems small but its simply good eats. Check it out
0,"As a native San Franciscan and resident New Yorker, I feel confident in my palate judgement. This was a huge disappointment. Our server never explained the menu, a la carte vs tasting etc, the butter tasted like the fridge, and the wine list was vague. Food was average, hostess was rude and snarky, and I left smelling like a cheap fifth avenue hooker. I could actually taste perfume in my mouth. We asked to be moved away the offender, but we still had stuffy smelly air around us across the room.  The wafting euro trash stank was so pervasive I could smell the restaurant in my hair the next morning. I just didn't have an overall pleasant experience. I \nWould enjoy this if I was drunk, and it was comped.  \nMore ventilation, better service.\n\nOnly perk:  I liked the black napkin for my black pants. And the kitchen staff was working hard."
1,"service was excellent.  Staff was attentive, flexible and professional.  My room was clean and comfortable.  They provide complimentary breakfast and happy-hour which made it even a better deal"
1,"I'll start off this review by saying that their cigar prices are over-priced. Hands down over-priced. You'll probably be able to score better tasting sticks elsewhere; however, when looking at the plethora of Arturo Fuentes, Ashtons, and House blends, you can't but help find something that you've never seen before on Thompson, Neptue, Cigarbid, etc.... and can't help but fork over the $30 you'd never imagine yourself spending on one smoke.\n\nIs it worth it? For me, it's worth it for just one stick they carry there that I can't find elsewhere; the Fuente Long Story Maduro....and I think this particular one is $21. \n\nThe area is pretty mellow! You've got an awesome guy manning the fortress..I mean, humidor; Colt, who's extremely knowledgable, and, if it's your first time trying out cigars, eager to teach in a very easy going manner. \n\nNatasha was my bartender. She made me one of the best mojitos....ever! \n\nIf you're into espresso, definitely give Carlito's Way a try! Effin' tasty. \n\nBeginning 2014, look forward to an enclosed front patio. Unfortunately the open-air patio drew quite a lot of complaints from neighbors inside the Forum, so they had to suspend outside smoking. Sad! But, just wait. An improvement lurks ahead. \n\n\nPark on Jay Sarno Way (Jay Sarno; the guy who designed Caesars) to get here if you're not staying at the hotel. It's a LOT shorter of a walk through the Forum shops. If you valet at the main front entrance, it's literally a solid 5-10 minute walk through the casino to get there. Or a 2 hour walk depending on how many times you park your ass on a table, on the way."
0,"Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about."
1,"My husband and I live in the area and gave Gus's a try.  I am a native New Yorker, so I consider myself a pizza connoisseur.  Both the wings and pizza were extraordinary!  You can tell that all the ingredients were fresh and the wings were of substantial size.  I noticed there seemed to be quite a few regulars, but the bartender was still extremely warm and welcoming to us.  We will definitely be back."
0,"I absolutely hate that this is the closest Starbucks to my house. It has to be the worst Starbucks in Vegas. Only a handful of the staff are actually pleasant. I've actually seen employees fighting while I'm waiting in line for my coffee, they swear at each other, and are completely rude to customers. Also prepare to wait FOREVER in the drive through line. And they do not care whatsoever if they get your order wrong or you wait for a century. Worst Starbucks in Vegas. I literally drive out of the way to go to the other Starbucks over the 215."
1,"I've been to this restaurant several times since my last review and I leave happy every time! I've ventured from the soup section and tried some of the other food as well and it is great! The combo meals are good value and taste delicious. I will keep returning, that is for sure!"
0,"Well its been a month since I've been here.  I figured Poshburger would've read reviews and fixed things.  After all, the owner is a Michelin-Star recipient...right???  That's all that I've read in all their PR.\n\nI was REALLY hoping that the 2nd time around would result in a 5-star rating!!!! \n\nWell, the two stars is basically based on great service from our server Sandra.  A very pretty Austrian gal who was the perfect blend of attentive-but-give-you-room-to-breathe server.\n\nI came with a buddy and we each ordered the Kobe.  This was my 2nd time trying this burger.  This time the foie gras was healthy-sized and it came to our table very attractively.  The couple to the next of us (uncomfortable due to the picnic tables) gawked at our burgers.  It looked great!!!\n\nUnfortunately, the burgers...again....came over-cooked.  I cut my burger in half and started eating.  I finished half of my burger when Sandra came around and checked on us.  I asked her whether my other half looked Medium-Rare and she said absolutely not.  She asked if I wanted a new burger and I said no....even thought the burger was very dry.  She asked again but I honestly didn't want to wait.  I did, however, appreciate her sincere concern.  Plus she was so pretty when she asked.  Haha.\n\nThe bun was so big in relation to the burger that I just removed the top bun.  My plate ended up as a big mess of overcooked burger and thick bread.  Sandra wasn't even sure whether my plate was ready to be cleared.\n\nI ordered the onion rings as a side  which was horrible.  Note to Michelin-Star chef...If you put onion rings inside a cone container, the rings will continue to cook in the steam and get soggy and the breading will fall off the onions!!!!  Any other decent restaurant that I've enjoyed good onion rings understands this and serves them open to allow the batter to adhere to the onions.  \n\nRocket science???  Poor understanding of Cooking 101???  Or an \""I don't give a shit\"" attitude that's apparent in every other aspect of this restaurant??? \n\nThe restaurant was not very busy and I would be very surprised to see Posh remain open for long.  \n\nOn a side note...I personally would've comped something for the admittedly overcooked burger.  A glass of wine.  A dessert.  A side.  Something!!!  The owner was there in the kitchen.  He clearly doesn't give a rat's ass.\n\nThe best description I have for this place is: CONFUSED.  \n\n- We are high end and we will charge $29 per burger but we will have casual picnic tables for you party.\n\n- We will operate in a Smith's Grocery Strip Mall in a suburban neighborhood full of families but we will remain dimly lit and without a family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nI will never return to Poshburger.  There are way too many good burger options in Vegas.  \n\nI really wish Gordon Ramsay could walk into this restaurant and give his 2-cents.  He would drop F-Bombs left and right because the owner is clearly blind to their actual clientele.  And if Gordon Ramsay saw the overcooked \""medium rare\"" Kobe burger that I was delivered, he would throw it in the owner's face and say \""Aw c'mon you wanker, how can a fucking Michelin-Star chef burn a good piece of meat like this.  Especially when there are only 10 other customers in the restaurant!!!!\""\n\nGood luck to anybody else who dares to waste their money at Poshburger,"
0,"I had a voucher for 30.00 that a friend had given me so I thought I would  check it out.  We sat on the patio on a Friday evening around 7:30.  The decor is beyond tacky, which in a strange way is kind of cool.  The service was ok, but just barely.  Indifferent is a better description. I ran out of iced tea several times and waited at least 10 minutes each time to get a refill.  NOTE:  Their iced tea is sort of raspberry flavored...period.  We ordered hummus and pita, which was really good.  Next we ordered two appetizers, the Greek pizza and some sort of avocado, feta, spinach on a pita thing, both of which were ok.  The baklava was ok.  \nThere were quite a few customers who came in who seemed to be Greek, and they got attentive service.  The music was kind of cool.\nI will try it one more time, but I am not very hopeful that my experience will be better.\nPerhaps the one in Baker is better."
1,"Was a little reluctant to try Jiffy Lube as opposed to my auto dealer for a basic oil change. I was afraid of the upselling etc. Since I was  overdue on this and hadn't made an appointment anywhere else I decided the (possible) expense of a burned out engine outweighed the annoyance of a \""shark\"" telling me there were multiple things wrong with my car. It turns out they were straightforward, friendly, efficient and I just needed an oil change. I was in and out and on the road."
0,"Tried this place because of a groupon.  Good thing it was at a discount, because it was not worth the money.\n\nWhile the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area, that is about all this place has going for it.\n\nI can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa is below average.\n\nI ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed.  First the waitress messed up my order.  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice, this is a mexican restaurant, right?  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans.  Umm...ok.  I didn't complain, bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food.  But this is definitely a first.  Overall, the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard.  \n\nI will not return."
1,Great people and even better food!
0,Its a little too pricey for what it is. I got the chili dog meal and it was very heavy (not complaining) and very dry (complaining). My son got the regular hot dog...again over priced and its a regular hot dog. I'm sure the people who love it are the ones who just really DOCTOR IT UP WITH ALL THE TOPPINGS. Then maybe I could see you getting your moneys worth?

0,"I recently moved to LV from the LA area so naturally I needed to find a mechanic.  Based on YELP I narrowed down my choices and ultimately decided on Ted Weins because of its proximity to the shopping center(silly, I know).  Nearing 100k miles I knew the spark plugs on my Expedition would need to be changed soon.  Sure enough after a couple trips back and forth from LV/CA the engine light comes on! Auto Zone diagnosed the problem for free! It was a misfire on #5(i have a V8).  So there I go to Ted Weins to get it fixed! They wanted $100 just to diagnose but would use this towards work done if I did it with them! I agreed, but only replaced one plug bcuz they quoted me $1100 to replace ALL 8!!!!  I leave happy and sure enough the engine light comes on again! Auto Zone diagnosed it for free again and now its a misfire on #6!  So I go to Ted Weins about 3pm to get the work done but they want to charge another $100 to diagnose it! A short time later I get a call and confirm what I already knew, a misfire on #6!  But, they tell me it's late and they can't finish before closing time(which they should of said b4 the diagnosis).  So I leave without paying the $100 with a promise to return, hence the reason they didn't charge me the $100 for the work they couldn't do that day anyway.  The next couple days the weathers horrible and I don't return.  Then I get a self induced illness(hang over).  I finally return to a not so pleased salesman who says he's on the hook for the $100 he \""should of charged me.\""  So I agree to have #6 replaced but NOW the work comes with a disclaimer of the plugs are VERY sensitive and need to be replaced when car is cool to avoid any breaks otherwise it cost an extra $100(coincidentally the same amount I supposedly owe them for a diagnosis on work they couldn't do).  So I leave the truck, go to the shopping center and wouldn't you know I get a call saying \""sorry, have to pay the extra $100, it broke while being replaced.\""  Not being one to complain(like now) I paid and left...... Fast FWD to present and I'm in LA.  I go to Auto Zone again and buy 6 spark plugs(for cheap) for the remaining ones that need to be replaced!  I use YELP to find a place in LA(granted its a gas station in East LA) and the guy tells me $65 bucks to replace the remaining 6!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course I take the chance and return a few hours later to a perfectly working car! I ask the guy did any of them break when u took them out.  And in his best Splanglish accent he replies, \""Na, ju just needs to no(know) what ger(your) doing.\""......... Happy with my car now but definitely looking for a new mechanic in LV!!!!!!! The honorable thing to do at Ted Weins would of been I'm sorry I should of charged you the $100 and gave you the credit when u returned and my boss got mad; and not \""let me find a way to get that $100 back.\"""
0,"I was going to tell a long story, but the basic fact is that the check-out clerk's parting remark to me was \""You're disgusting.\""  We had disagreed, but not argued.  Even if I had been disgusting, no retail clerk should every utter those words to a customer!  I will never set foot in Ulta again (at least not after I return the product I cannot now stand to use)."
1,Hello all! \nWe watched planet of the apes today and wanted to leave my review of the theatre. We have been here several times prior to this time. \nWe did purchase our tickets online and conveniently printed them at the kiosk. However we did buy popcorn and drinks at the concession 20.00 for a large popcorn and 2 med drinks . The concession worker was new and did not know how to let me cash in regal points for our popcorn so we went ahead and just purchased it. No big deal but it would have been nice if she offered to find someone that knew how. \n\nThe theatre was clean and the temperature was not overly cold as some theaters can be. \n\nThe audio and video was great no issues. \n\nParking was convenient and not overly crowded. \n\nI would suggest going in the afternoon since the evening does get busier.
1,"Sylvia from Monsoon is the GREATEST host that I have ever done business with. Thanks to her knowledge I have never been to a Vegas party that wasn't a GREAT time!! I try to come out to Vegas every 3 months and she always has the best restaurants lined up complete with reservations. The bottom line is that when I land in Vegas I get to be on vacation, because Sylvia takes care of everything I could need! \n\nThe Monsoon group is the top of the game! The whole team has always been extremely friendly and treats you like family when your around them.\n\nIf you go to Vegas with out Monsoon your not \""REALLY\"" Doing Vegas!"
0,"heard raving reviews about this place...and i really wanted to like it. \n\ntoo bad their service outweighs their food. \n\nwent with a party of three, two of us wanted to order AYCE and the other wanted just a combo dinner. i asked if we order everything we want first or if we ordered one roll, finish it, and then they'll bring us another roll. the lady very rudely asked \""if we've ever been to an AYCE before\"" which we have..and which is also why i asked what their rule was. we began to order one roll plus an appetizer each and she said that we MUST finish everything, including the rice and if not, they will charge us a la carte price, even if we didn't like the taste of it. this was new to me. all of the AYCE sushi places i've been to, if i didn't like the roll, they would happily take it away and let me order again. Anyway, it's not about the rule i'm complaining about but her god damn attitude and tone of voice. even the surrounding tables talked about her crappy attitude so i know we weren't thinking this in our heads...\n\nthen because of AYCE rule and the one hour limit, we decided to just order off the menu.we got the sush dinner for two, one fancy smancy role and an appetizer.  somewhere along the way, another meal got added to our table. when we questioned it, she said someone ordered a combo first time around then when she came back to take the rest of our orders, she assumed we still wanted the first order. assumed?!!? if you weren't sure, why didn't you ask? she was so unapologetic about it and basically said \""even if you don't eat it, you're still getting charge for it.\"" \n\nruined our experience. definitely won't be back."
1,"If there were more quirky/non-corporate places like this hiding around AZ, this state would be so much better. Unfortunately for us, there are few. Fortunately for Bertha's, they are one of them and will surely capitalize on that for years to come. \n\nThis place doesn't look like much on the inside or the outside but the food makes you forget all that superficial stuff right when it hits your eyes. I tasted the Thai Chicken Wrap and the Chicken Curry wrap and both were tasty, large, and well worth the cheap prices that we paid for them. The wraps even came with a perfect little cookie....not that I needed it because I had a huge Cream Cheese Fudge Brownie sitting in front of me!!!!!! \nThis place was already good enough and then you add Cream Cheese Brownies, Candy Bar Brownies, Lemon Bars, Peanut Bar Brownies, Pumpkin Cheesecake, House Made Doughnuts....etc....you see where I am going with this. Their pastry/dessert selection is worth stealing out of your Grandmother's purse for. And you won't need to take much, everything is affordable if not cheap. \n\nSo I'm going to say 4 stars!!! It loses a star for its lack of service. There really was no service and no friendliness to go with the amazing food."
1,A friend and I visited this theatre the other day and the movie we intended on seeing was no longer showing. It was cancelled because another movie was doing so well. I was surprised when they told me and my friend to come inside for free passes! The staff was extremely friendly and apologized several times for the movie being cancelled. I was very impressed with the customer service and will drive out of my way to come to this location again!
0,"I have been a customer of Glazier's for a number of years, and I was APPALLED today by the treatment I received from the customer service desk, and subsequently from \""Flora\"", the front end manager.\n\nEvery week after I do my shopping, I stop at customer service to get a roll of quarters. Today, I was told by the lady behind the counter, \""We dont' normally do this, but I will do it for you today.\"" First of all, as an individual who earns my living developing customer service training programs, I was taken back to say the least. I asked to speak to the manager, and was presented with a lady named Flora, who only made matters worse. I told her that I had been a customer for years and that being told \""We normally don't do this.\"" outraged me. She only made excuses and NEVER ONCE apologized and offer to get me a roll of quarters right away. Glazier's owners should be incensed that this lack of customer service is being exhibited by front end management.\n\nI informed Flora that I would not be shopping with Glazier's any longer and it didn't phase her in the least. I even gave her the groceries I had just purchased and asked for a refund.\n\nI REFUSE to shop at an establishment that treats their customers in this manner.\n\nThey tout themselves to be \""family owned\""... a \""mom and pop\"" which is why I support them. I HATE BIG BOX RETAILERS, but am now forced to shop elsewhere due to the piss poor management they have entrusted with their store.\n\nIf you don't mind being \""just another customer\"" enjoy your shopping experience at Glazier's. If you value being treated as a valued customer, RUN to the next closest store!"
1,"AMS Landscaping did a terrific job. From the woman that answered the phone to the two men that completed the job we were very impressed with their professionalism! I called AMS and was told that an estimate would be done on Wednesday, and sure enough, Eli from AMS Landscape completed his estimate on Wednesday. He emailed me pictures of the job and his pricing. When I emailed him back about a specific question, he responded within just a few minutes which was very impressive. We agreed on a price and scheduled the service to be completed. We were very happy with the work done (trimming bushes, cleaning up weeds, raking rocks and they even moved some river rocks for us from what side of the house to another!) Overall, I am very impressed with AMS Landscaping and would use them again as well as refer them to friends and family."
1,"I have many pictures of my four legged kids, most not very good as I can never get them to sit still long enough to capture the 'who' it is that they are.  Christmas of last year, I decided I needed professional assistance and contacted Michelle Pelberg of Cow Dreamz  Photography, (602) 510-1929.  Michelle will meet prospective clients in most any setting as it is her mission to photograph pets relaxed and in their element.  We decided on a local park and met in the afternoon.  Like all great photographers, Michelle snapped away, remaining inconspicuous as my dogs enjoyed a winter day in the great out doors.\n\nI will utilize Michelle in any future pet photography project and happily endorse her services to all interested parties.  She has a knack for capturing the essence of our beloved four legged kids."
1,"Thank goodness for Ali and The Parlor! I've had so many bad hair experiences that I would go over a year between cuts because the stylists would always cut off way too much or give me horrible layers for my hair type. It was always a cookie cutter cut. \n  \nMy 1st visit to The Parlor was impressive. Myself and my daughter were both ready for a change. We were greeted with a smile and very cute sign that welcomed us as new clients. My 13 loved that. Ali was our stylist and she was amazing. She took time to actually ask us real questions about how we maintain our hair, how we prefer to wear it, what styling products we use, and \""played\"" with our hair before even touching the scissors! \n\nMy daughter is African American and often times her hair is butchered when we have it cut or she's told she can't have long hair because it won't work. Well, Ali fixed my poor daughters hair that had been horribly botched a year before. Ali made sure to tell her how to keep her hair healthy and even set out a plan to help her to get it to grow out. She was so excited and felt hope instead of defeat for what she couldn't have.\n\nNow on to me, after 10 years of non-dyed hair if finally took the plunge! And I love it!!! Ali actually put a color on and started to prep for cutting but wasn't happy with the color and said she wanted it perfect. She did a little change and it was perfect!!! She listened to my past layering complaints and only cut off what was asked and did a beautiful job of making my hair easy to maintain. \n\nI've already booked our next appointments and am finally excited about going back the salon!"
0,"I miss the glory days of Buffalo.  Ten years ago while I was in high school, (gawd. I feel old) this used to be my favorite store.  It was a great place to find unique/alternative clothing at a decent price.  Better yet, I was apparently a stylish young thang because whenever I cleaned out my closet and took it here, I would get at least $65 in store credit to get some new digs.  \n\nThese days,  I feel like Buffalo relies more heavily on the brand than they used to.  Its not uncommon to find used jeans here for $60 or jackets for $45 - all because of the label.  I'm sure its still a great bargain, its just not \""nice thrift store\"" that I grew up on.  Its also become increasingly difficult to sell my clothing here - if I bring them 10 items, I'm lucky if they take one.  \n\nThey need to figure out a way to improve their line to sell stuff.  I went in last night and there were 6 people already waiting with ONE employee \""buying\"" things.  I knew I actually wanted to look at clothes before I had to make dinner, so I threw my bag of stuff I wanted to sell in the car and just went inside to shop.  They need some kind of number system where I can shop AND still have my place in line. \n\n*pours a forty for the \""old\"" Buffalo*"
0,I have been to this location a handful of times but idk if I will be coming back mainly because of the oscars...so this is what happened:\n\nMy bf and I ask our waiter if he can turn one of the tv to abc so we can watch the Oscars while we eat. The waiter goes n the back and says yes they will change it. So we get our appetizer of oxtail fries and the channel still hasn't changed. \n\nWe basically finish the platter and still haven't seen our waiter 2 remind him about the channel so we flag down another waiter. This waiter says something like we don't change the channel and y would u want 2 watch it with out volume but I will see what we can do.\n\nBy this time our burgers come out. I am semi enjoying my Kiki burger when our first waiter approaches. He remembers that he was going 2 change the channel and ask us y the channel hasn't changed. OMG @ this point we just ask for our check and leave.\n\nIdk what the big deal was it was 530 on a Sunday with 3 other people in the restaurant and they were not even facing the tv.\n\nI doubt we will return.
1,"A good brunch spot in Pittsburgh with decent food which isn't too greasy and a full line of espresso drinks. The last time I was here was right before closing time, and I was a bit dismayed that they started mopping the floor with some noxious smelling chemicals before our group had finished eating. Kind of ruined the experience, but that's only happened once -- I guess you should come early to avoid that!"
1,"Extraordinary service.  After searching the Valley high and low for a specific size and color of Brooks to no avail, guess who had them?  Yep. These guys. \n\nSuper friendly staff.  Knowledgeable.  Polite. Interested in me.  \n\nGlad I ended up here.  Will look no further for running needs moving forward. \n\nShop here. You'll run happy!"
1,"Steak and cheese is to die for. You have to be patient bc your order is going to take 20-30 mins regardless of how busy they are (or aren't). Have a beer, soda or glass of wine while you wait bc they sell it all. There is also a patio area out back. Enjoy!"
0,"Zink, get it together.  We were here on a busy Sat night, and though our waiter was really friendly, he was the only one in the section of about 12 tables.  When he brought our water, it was still warm from the cleaning of the carafe.  Thinking maybe this was a regional thing, I looked around at our fellow diners, who all had cold water.  Seems like a small thing, but when we asked after the 3rd time, we just wondered if it was because we were so hot (literally) that the water just made itself warm...LOL.  Our hummus was less than stellar, and made me miss home.  We split Salmon and the portions were so tiny, it was like taking 2 bites.   Plus, they were served with fingerling potatoes...which creep me out.  \nOn a good note, the atmosphere was nice and cozy, until these 4 very high maintenance women (also pissed about their warm water) sat inches from us.  They complained about the portions and size, and asked me if our waiter also mentioned he was having a bad night.  \nI'd be willing to give them a chance again, but I likely won't be back to Charlotte anytime soon."
0,"Absolutely the most disgusting bathrooms I have ever seen, worse than a 29 Palms roadside gas station. Every time I dine there I bring up the dirtiness of the facility and every time I return (hoping thay have rectified the situation) the bathroom seems the same.\n\nThe only saving grace is the excellent food (especially the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast)  and waitstaff in the restaraunt, if not for that reason I would never step foot in there."
1,This is such a nice library: clean and modern with lots of natural light and lots of areas where you can settle in and study. The have a LOT of computer workstations and can accommodate a lot of people.\n\nThey also have a nice outdoor patio area that is peaceful and inviting. I firmly believe that the right environment is important when you're trying to study or get work done. This place EXCELS on that level.

0,"I would not go back to yogini again.  They are NOT honest people & quite confrontational.  They pulled a bate and switch on their pricing..  They told me I could pay there, on site, for a living social deal $19 unlimited yoga.  They took my $20.  I took the class, and now they  just called to tell me that I have to buy it through living social.  So, I have to pay another $19 to get this deal.  I just paid $20.   When trying to explain that the receptionist took my $20 with the verbal agreement of unlimited yoga for a month,  she hung up on me.\n    If I would have gotton the deal, I would have gone four times to feel I got my money's worth.  If I would have gotten the class for free I would not go back again.  So, what it comes down to is... this studio leaves much to be desired and to top it off they are not nice.  WARNINING. Do Not Go To Yoginis."
1,"I prefer the off-strip younger resorts.  I typically choose to stay at Hard Rock, Rio, or Palms.  They are a bit more hip, not crowded with hover-rounds, and offer kick-ass pools.  The room was updated and nice.  The dealers were friendly, and the on-site food was ok."
1,"what A JOY TO FIND THIS RESTAURANT IN Scottsdale AFTER MANY OTHER DISAPPOINTING MEALS AT OTHER RESTAURANTS IN TOWN.  My husband ordered the traditional breakfast and I had the Pecan Chicken Salad, which was delicious. Portions were large and tasty.  The waitress was attentive and suggested items for us to try.  Very good prices compared to many others in this expensive town.  I heartily recommend this cafe for breakfast or brunch, and know you won't be disappointed,  We ate here 3 out of 5 days for brunch and it was always good food.r"

1,Restaurants should be rewarded for taking care of business and having good employees.  I arrived 10 mins before lunch hr was over but had to go to the cox store. I walked in an Tamara the host helped me. I asked if I could order my lunch so I can get the lunch special but run to cox quick. I hate missing the lunch special. She honored my order. I came back an the food came out 5 mins later. Kudos. Thank you Tamara!
0,"I've been here twice.  The first time I think I just got a salad and a Fat Tire beer.  I thought it was okay, and after going to Famous Dave's BBQ a few times since -- and really enjoying the BBQ flavors  there -- I decided to return to Memphis BBQ for a change.  This time I got the pulled chicken sandwich with sides of cole slaw and a vegetable medley.  My friend got a four-meat platter.\n\nWe were both quite disappointed.  I expected the chicken to be more flavorful than it was.  I took half the sandwich home and finished it later.  It was edible, but nothing to celebrate.  The cole slaw was just awful.  It tasted sour.  I just took a couple of bites of that and didn't even take the rest of it home with me.   The vegetable medley was okay.\n\nMy friend's opinion of the four-meat platter was that it was a one-note dish.  All the meats she chose (chicken, beef brisket, pork burnt tips, and Louisiana ribs) tasted pretty much the same.  Like the chicken on my sandwich, they were not well-sauced, and you couldn't escape the overly-pungent smokiness of the dish.\n\nI tasted one of her pork burnt tips and was put off by the smoked flavor myself.\n\nLesson learned.  I won't be going back to Memphis BBQ.  If you want great BBQ, I would recommend Famous Dave's."
0,"Ate here on a Saturday night. I like that some proceeds are donated to local hunger efforts.\n\nBut, the service was somewhat lacking. We weren't checked on after our food arrived. Nearby tables were left unbussed. It wasn't terribly crowded.\n\nThe food was acceptable, though my companion's steak was overdone."

1,"So far, this has been the best pho takeout place I've encountered in Phoenix/Tempe.\n\nThe broth is EXQUISITE. It smelled a little funky but it tastes fabulous. Hearty, flavorful, and extremely satisfying. PHO = BROTH. I would give ten stars for their broth if I could.\n\nI like that they separate the cilantro and onions from the noodles (in the takeout box). I don't mind having raw onion in the broth to add a little more flavor, but I hate that lingering taste.\n\nI would have given them a full five stars, but their chicken meat is rubbery and dry. Probably the quality of the beef is better since beef can be served rare and cook a little in the hot broth, but I don't like fatty meats. \n\nAlso, it's a bit pricier than expected for pho. Back home in Colorado, I could get a large bowl of pho for under $6.50. Here, it comes to just under $8."
1,"Chinese eats are never my first pick when I'm hungry, but when I craving my one and only fav' Chinese dish, pan fried noodles, i gotta have it right away. \n\nDidn't feel like driving all the way to Spring Mountain, oriental central, so thankfully Yelp helped led the way to this nearby chinese spot. Inside has some nice contemporary furnishings , Walls painted a nice dark grey, really warm and comfy inside. \n\nOrdered the pan fried noodles, aka hong kong style chow mein. Noodles perfectly crispy, broccoli/carrots fresh, meat tender not chewy, shrimp plump. \n\nMy bf ordered Kung pao chicken lunch special comes with delicious egg soup, hot the way soup should be delivered, right? The nice part of it was the wonton strips served with a tasty orange zest sauce. Mmm-m-mmm.. Mm.\n\nSo the food is good, definitely better than the usual all you can eat, but of course I've had much better at a seafood house or china town. Not bad at all, I'll be back."

1,"We went to Joel Robuchon to celebrate our wedding, I had been looking forward to this dinner for a long time and it exceeded my expectations. First off let me say that this is not just a meal, it is an event. We were picked up from our hotel by the MGM's complimentary limo service and taken though The Mansions at MGM Grand (where the high rollers stay). We were greeted by the hostess and escorted through the mansions to the restaurant where we were seated at a booth in the corner. (I highly reccomend trying to book one of these as oposed to their smaller tables)\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the 6 course menu which included an apetizer, soup, 2 main courses, a cheese course and dessert. As if this were not enough also included with all of the menu's is the amuse bouche, bread cart and the dessert cart. My husband had also called ahead and told them about our wedding and that I had also celbrated my birthday the week before so they gave us a celebration cake as well.\n\nEach course got better and better with the exception of one of my main dishes and my husbands dessert choice. This was not because the quality wasn't superb but because the flavor was not something we enjoyed. My favorite dish of the night were the veal cheeks, you must order this! My least favorite was the roasted lobster which was served over rice with sea urchin and asian flavors.. it just didn't appeal to me.\n\nI would also highly reccomend getting the cheese course if you can afford it and enjoy cheese, we both tried a few different kinds that we had never had before and loved each one.\n\nOverall this was the best dining experience I have ever had even though at times the service can be a bit snooty and over the top but so is the food! I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone who loves food and can afford to pull out all the stops for one night."
1,"I feel very fortune that we have such a great local gem in town. I fell in love with this small shop after my first visit, and became a super big fan about it. Art of flavor is owned by a married couple. They both are very sweet and nice. If it's your first visit, they would probably hand you as many samples as you want. There is no flavor I don't like! Everything tastes awesome! They have a lot of interesting flavors (basil and tomato, rosemary and olive oil, chocolate and pepper, goat cheese and pear). They always have something to surprise me when I pay my weekly visit. It's like an adventure coming here. They also sell gelato in boxes for to go. I sometimes get a small box to satisfy my sweet tooth \""daily\"" . (Since this is totally in the other side of town from my house. And I can't visit here everyday) Art of flavor is truly 5 stars in my yelp book!"
1,I liked the buffet here- Flavors was surprisingly good. They even have gelato! I was stoked. The tables are moderately priced as well. You get some free shit for joining their players club.
1,There are hundreds of Starbucks' all over town but this particular one is my favorite. I have never had a problem there and the employees are very friendly! They have a comfortable seating area and a calm setting which is exactly what I like in the morning.
0,"CRAPPIEST CHINESE JOINT I'VE EVER EATEN AT! AVOID! \n\nI don't want to give it one star, but there's not an option for NO STARS on here. This place is CRAP.\n\nIt's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...\n\nAnyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, \""What do you want?\"". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.\n\nWhat we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't. \n\nWhen we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it. \n\nDon't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service."
0,"Went in on Saturday, early evening. The hostess went to seat us in a small alcove next to kitchen when over half the restaurant was empty.  We asked to be seated else where, which she did after some mumbling.  We ordered  prime rib ($42) and sirloin ($43) along with two sides, mushrooms and green beans.  Food came out cold even the sides that are in a small cast iron pan.  There is no reason that food at a steakhouse should come out cold. I had to ask twice for horseradish sauce and my husband sent his steak back to be heated which of course leaves each person dinning alone and your steak not done as requested? This is not the experience one likes to have when going out for dinner TOGETHER especially in Vegas. So as you can see, what happened in Vegas is not going to stay in Vegas. Go elsewhere...this was unsatisfactory."
1,Stay Here everytime I make a trip to Vegas! Love the restaurants on the property and not to mention the great rooms! Never had a complaint... If you're complaining about the rooms looking low end maybe thats because you're in Vegas and you need to spend a bit more and maybe upgrade a few floors because the new upgraded rooms are amazing!!
1,"Great resort, really nice rooms, and a great property with a great pool.  There is a creek that runs all over the property and it is a great little walk or run if the weather permits.  We usually go on stay-cation on the 4th of July to enjoy the pool and watch the fireworks show from Rawhide so we do not have to drive home in traffic.  There is a nice restaurant there and the service is spectacular.  Highly recommend this place, especially in the winter when the weather is best in Phoenix.  We came here this year with a huge group and the rain made it tough but they even hosted a festival inside one of their huge hall rooms (built for huge weddings) and the kids loved it and we got to have a bar and seating for the adults.  They took good care of us."

There are some things that should just be documented.\n\nArriving, it was first class all the way.  Limited access to the taxi line at the front of the hotel and a gentleman to hold the door for me.  As I approached the check-in desk, a hostess asked my last name and \""presented me\"" to the desk clerk.  We made small talk as she asked me whether I wanted a high floor or low floor, a room with a King or 2 queen beds, a smoking or non-smoking room.  I answered low floor, king near the elevator, non-smoking.  I received my keys and she showed me on a map to the elevators.\n\nI got to the bank and I see I'm on the 42nd floor.  OK, maybe this is the lowest she could get me with a King, non-smoking near the elevator.  I took the extremely quiet and effortless elevator ride and got off on 42.  I immediately noticed I was nowhere near the elevators.  Instead I was at the end of the hall.  OK... not that far to walk.  I put my key in the room and enter and immediately notice it's 2 Queen beds, not the king I requested.  OK... not a big deal.  How much space do I really need.  And who knows... maybe I'll have a friend stay in town from LA while I'm here, and now they have a place to crash.  No big deal.\n\nI also notice that the room is huge.  2 beds and a few steps down to a sunken living room, complete with L-shaped sofa, coffee table, a medium-sized dining table and a work desk, complete with fax and printer.\n\nI also noticed that the credenza was moved like somebody was trying to get to the switch behind it.  I also noticed 2 moths flying around the room, bouncing into the lights and pictures in the room.  I noticed that the room doesn't have a laundry bag so I can store my dirty clothes.  And it's hot!  Nothing like entering a hotel room that is nearly as hot as it is outside.  And today, in Vegas it was about 99 degrees.  I turn on the air and decide it's time to checkout the bathroom to take a leak.  The toilet seat nearly falls off!\n\nI plugged in and the wi-fi and internet is $9.95 per day, so I'm using my own Sprint card to post this.\n\nFor the price my company is paying for me to stay here, and for the quality of what I expected walking in the door, I'm pretty unimpressed with my first impression.  I've already put a call into maintenance, and they say they'll send somebody up quickly to address the moth, but it may not be until tomorrow morning to move the credenza or tighten the toilet.  They offered to move me, but I'm already unpacked and settled in for the night.  I'm not moving unless it's right next door, and they can't promise that.\n\nMaybe I'll post an update.  Pretty unimpressive so far."
0,"This place is a terrible value.  For $9 my burrito better be good, huge or both.  At La Loma it was neither.  There is no kids menu so I even over paid for my children.  Top it all off with an order at the counter and eat off Styrofoam experience and there's no reason to go back.\n\nI really liked the owner's old place, Arturo's, but La Loma has none of Arturo's great qualities.  We knew we had to try La Loma, now that we have, we'll never go back."
0,The old Epicentre Theatre was great. The way they have this set-up now is terrible. You wait in a line to get into the theatre and sometimes it's the wrong line. Nobody explains the process and the numerous staff members mulling around had no idea. \n\nWhen I tried to order spinach dip I was told it's not sold individually but they had a two dip special for $25 and even that was terrible and took way too long to get.\n\nGo during the week maybe it will be better or drive somewhere else.
1,"Great place to get an authentic mixed drink.  Tracy was great, she made sure that the staff took great care of us.  We challenged the mixologist TJ to make us each an original drink with our favorite liquor.  He crushed it.  Each drink was perfect.  I highly recommend this experience."
0,"The hostesses were less than friendly, close to being rude.  \nWe waited over 75 minutes for a table, but there were 13 people so we expected to wait.  Honestly it wasn't worth it though.  The food was overpriced although the steak sandwich $33 was pretty tasty.  The Frozen hot chocolate was like drinking chocolate milk with lots of whipped cream for $12!"
1,"Normally, I wouldn't write a review about an airport. But, because it's Vegas, this airport is... uh... special.\n\nIt all started two days prior when my lady friend got pick-pocketed on the strip. I heard later that Las Vegas has the biggest crime rate of any city in America. Whether that is true or not is up to what you read, I guess, but it makes sense for this story. After contacting the airline and the police, we were told that we could make it through security, but it would be tricky, and to arrive two hours early.\n\nSo, we showed up three hours early. Being Las Vegas, it's both very hot, and very booze-soaked. I had been nauseous throughout a lot of the trip, why, I still do not know. Something to do with the heat, the eat, and the alcohol turning everything sideways.\n\nWe waited in line to have our ID's checked; both of us with single carry on bags. I went first since I had a good ID. She went after me and simply and plainly told the TSA agent. \""I have no ID, here is the police report\"".\n\n\n***SUPERVISOR TO GATE THREE***\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nLuckily the supervisor was pretty laid back. He got on the phone with some mystery government official on the other end, and in a few short minutes, and after a few brief questions politely queried at the side of gate three, we were on our way. Two hours early.\n\nDue to the security hangup, the TSA supervisor allowed us to cut in line and we ended up waiting for the plane to arrive for about 2.5 hours. I took a few walks through the makeshift casinos to alleviate my sickness from the stress and other aforementioned contributing factors, but by the time we got on the plane and got in the sky, the nausea was gone, and we were home free."
1,I bought a Groupon a few months ago and was nervous for my first Brazilian wax. Kris is wonderful and she's now the only person I trust to wax anything! She always makes time to get me in without a long wait for an appointment. I'll be back there in three weeks :)
1,Lots of variety on menu. Slow service but very kind and polite. Moules marinieres were too salty. Baked beans were sweet and delicious.
1,"Nice reasonable price breakfast, just right before a round of golf \n\nStaff are super friendly and efficient \n\nWill be back"
1,"Beautiful spot in a beautiful part of town.  Drove by this place a couple of time and I got really curious about it.  This looks like a beautifully restored brick building which may have been an office building at one time.  Downstairs is appears to be more of a bar type area where drinking rules.  There is a second story where it appears to be more of a dining area.  There is also an outdoor patio area which really looks with about 10 tables which really looks like a nice place.\n\nAte on the second floor dining area.  The decor is pretty much the basic Irish Pub look, dark wood bootsh, wood floorks, kind of a dark atmosphere that was brightened by sunlight shining through the windows.  The menu is very basic barfood with an irish slant to it.  My freind had fish and chips and I had a cheeseburger.  To be honest, I wouldn't be drawn here by the food, but it wouldn't keep me away either.  Food was good.  Best part part about this place is that it's got this great atmosphere that's relaxing, you have a good selection of beers and you can have food or snacks thats satisfying.\n\nTo me thats worth a return trip or two."
0,"I am pretty sure my friends and I stumbled into a coke party when we came here for a late bite after a house show back in the Neighborhood.\n\nThe lights were low, there were people dry humping each other wall-to-wall, and lots of frequent, quick trips in and out of the bathrooms by staff and guests alike.\n\nAll to a soundtrack of terrible techno.\n\nAll of this would've been worth a laugh if it weren't for the food.  We ordered a vegan pizza, a couple cheese slices, and an order of garlic knots.\n\nThe vegan pizza was a barely-cooked pie with hummus haphazardly smeared across it.  The worst part about it was the paprika - they had attempted to season the hummus, but for some reason, rather than sprinkling the spices across the entire pie, there were 5 distinct, huge mounds of paprika that spotted the pie like an outbreak of chickenpox.\n\nThe slices came out first, and were cold even before we reminded them that we ordered garlic knots - which took an unholy 20 mintues, after we reminded them.\n\nTo top it all off - the garlic knots, those of the epic cooking time, were completely cold and raw in the middle.\n\nEddie's pizza is like some bizarre circle of hell."
0,"Went in for a beer after I hiked Squaw Peak, had seen this place on Yelp since it was near my house.  The other customers were very nice, the bartender was not. The happy hour prices were not even that good, I could walk to 4 places near by that are more friendly and have better HH."
0,"Ferguson joined me on a business trip here and wanted to try the famed food network acclaimed Primanti Bros. So we did.  It is now crossed off his  bucket list with heavy, angry lines that ripped through the paper in spots.  To those of you with it on your bucket list cross it off now.  It may have been a great place when you were rolling through town with a load of pig iron and had 15 minutes to fill your gullet but it currently has no redeemable value other than the kitschy idea of putting everything on your sandwich.  \n\nBread - big,thick fluffy pieces that consumes the sandwich,\nMeat - under proportioned for the size and quantity of bread. \nSlaw - yes.  There's also slaw in sandwich.\nFries - precooked.  Soggy.\n\nSo many other things in Pittsburgh to try. Heck, potato filled pasta pockets (pierogis) have more character.\n\nSo no more. Food network hype."
1,"One word...AWESOME!  The breakfast is amazing and the coffee is perfect.  Must try for anyone visiting Charlotte, NC.  I have tried their Omelets as well as their breakfast sandwiches.  The sweet potato hash side is my favorite. Get there early and check out their specials online."
0,I have been a customer for over 30 years but never again. I was double billed for a meal and contacted them about it. I made many attempts and kept receiving an automated response that they would be contacting me. I still haven't heard from them concerning this matter after nearly three months of trying. I like the food but customer service is bad.
0,If you are delivering here you most likely will have a c-section. Five of my girlfriends and I have all gotten c-sections from this hospital. I was 5 centimeters in and 5 hours into my labor when they decided I had been in labor too long. It just seems like the doctors just want to push you in and out and not give you any time or chance. This is the most important time for a mother. Please give her a chance. A lot of us dream of natural vaginal births. \n\nNursing staff is great though. Both during labor and after. Everyone took good care of me and my son. Ashley was my labor nurse and she is probably one of the most professional people ever. So thankful she took care of me throughout my labor and delivery. I hope she is there for a very long time so she can help deliver my next baby. The nursery also is great and they were so caring and loving to my son. I just have a bitter taste due to these c-sections. Just wish doctors these days tried a little harder.
0,"Utterly underwhelmed.\n\nI, as many of the other reviewers here, was a guest at the W Hotel, and weary from a travel-day getting here.  My group of three came in fairly late, although not close enough to closing that we were the last guests.  It was at that point that I had just about the only pleasant experience at Otto - a kind and gracious hostess welcoming us and seating us.\n\nThe disdainful waitress who replaced her at our table seemed offended that she had to actually speak to us to suggest specials and take our orders, although she did do us the favor of leaving us alone and sparing us her withering glares for extended periods of time.  The tuna tartare was quite delicious, but the risotto was mediocre at best, although given the amount of time it took for the dish to get to us I would have thought it was being prepared with great pomp and ceremony.  Maybe they were preparing our waitress' dinner instead, as I noticed her eating through the glass divider while we were left forlorn at our table.\n\nI put it plainly to the hotel's Resident Manager - I will always be a regular at the W Montreal, but unless things change I will never set foot in Otto again."
1,"I've been visiting Kabuki since 2012 and I have enjoyed sampling the menu.  Some of my favorites are the mozzarella rolls, the new Tokyo Quesadilla (try them before they're taken off the always changing menu), and mostly the sashimi.  They have a superb customer rewards program too, so take advantage of it."
0,"I was feeling lazy after working, and after looking through my fridge I decided to order Chinese food. I have had a menu for this place on my fridge for awhile, so I decided to call them up. They delivered my food in about and hour. The egg roll tasted like balls, and the cheese wontons were missing the cheese. I hit the Thai Chicken, and it was ok, but all in all I will never order from this place again, and I would urge you, yes you, to choose a different place tonight. #NotWorthIt....."
1,"This place is always great! The service is good and the food is as well.  I have eaten here a number of times and I have always been pleased.  The last time that I had the pleasure of enjoying dinner here I was just a tad bit disappointed only because they had switched to a different type of bread (although it was good too) besides the one that they use to serve with marinara sauce. Other than that, I will always return here!"
0,"2 words:  truly bad!\nMy fellow yelpers have never let me down before, so I was so ready to eat here.  All these fantastic 5 star reviews had to be dead on, right?  I looove a good breakfast place and enjoy supporting, local mom and pop family type operations, so I was definitely looking forward to naming Babycakes as my new b'fast/brunch stop.  Never mind.\n\nSo awful all the way around that I will not even go into all the details.  The entire experience was a loss - it started from the indifferent greeting (barely a look up in our direction from the hostess at the podium/cashier desk in front) followed with painstaking slow service and then topped off with cold, rubbery food thrown on a plate.  The bad service was not offset by the equally poor food, or vice versa.\n\nAnd what is with the grunge/slime in the iced tea!  How hard is it to brew tea?  That should have been my sign to leave befor even attemtping to eat.  Bad, bad!"
1,"Wow, I'm so excited to have found a really good veggie cheeseburger. I know right? A veggie burger at Capriottis? I was scratching my head too when I saw this on the menu. Didn't even know this was on there. But I'm thrilled that I got it because I've had veggie burgers at other places and none of it were as good as this one. What I loved so much about it was that it didnt fall apart so easily and it wasn't bland at all. I had Justin add some grilled onions, mushroom, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and mayo and ketchup--all that in between the kaiser buns and it was veggie cheese burger heaven..yum. It was also pretty big for a small order so I saved the other half for later. Also a bonus: the price! It only cost 4.50! Plus the service was, as usual, awesome! One thing though that stil needs improvent was the cleanliness of the tables. It just needed to be wiped down more. There were crumbs and grease left over from previous patrons. Other than that, everything was gravy!"
0,"Sorry to say this place is disgusting.  I had the caprese salad, which was fine and the margarita pizza which was meh...   My fianc\u00e9 had the Philly Cheese Steak and it was terrible!  He took two bites and couldn't eat the rest.  I took one just to confirm.  Ick!  \n\nThe view of the fountain would be nice if it wasn't obstructed by the huge metal fence that bordering the patio.  \n\nStaff was pleasant and we were seated and served quickly.  Other then that I don't know how this place stays open with returning customers.  I would definitely not recommend going here."
0,"Based on the Yelp recommendation that \""Vegetarians go nuts for this place\"", I came and stood in the long line until I got almost to the front and noticed that there is only one vegetarian sandwich on the menu. And it's the same boring sandwich that I've seen many times at delis.\n\nI'm not sure how to let Yelp know that they definitely need to remove the vegetarian tag for this place, because it's not any more vegetarian friendly than any other restaurant in Vegas, so just be warned!"
1,"Can you say \""everclear 195 proof\""?"
1,"I'm a big fan of the Cirque du Soleil shows and have seen over 10 of them, not one of them a disappointment.  After watching this show, Mystere is now one of my favorite Cirque du Soleil shows.  The stunts they pulled and the acrobatics were amazing!  The most incredible part of the show was when two men were showing us how much the human body is really capable of.  The cast was incredible talented and performed flawlessly.  If you're into acrobatics and want to see how crazy gracefully flexible and strong the human body is, you can't miss this show!   Is it expensive?  It can be?  Is it worth it?  Hell yes!"
1,"I remember eating at Boston Pizza back in Hawaii years ago.  I remember it being really good and having huge slices.  I went to their website and WHOA! Two for Tuesdays....guess what day it was when I found out  Boston Pizza was in Vegas? The stars must've aligned and it was fate....unless you are one of those that believe that there is too much randomness and coincidence in the world to conclude a causal relationship between the day, the stars, and pizza.  Anyway, I got the signature Boston Pizza, large. My free pizza for this deal was a large Pepperoni. I had pizza for almost a week! Yeah, 16\"" pizzas may not be much, but these guys are generous with their toppings! Heck I ate this the next morning for breakfast (cold, the second best way to eat pie) and I also did the pizza warm up trick on the stove where you place the slice on the pan to reharden the crust and warm up the toppings at the same tiime. The pizza doesn't taste \""corporate\"" (e.g. Pizza Hut or Dominos).  I don't know, it's like homemade pizza without the fail.  Heads up, you will end up parking next to Olympic Gardens so I'll leave it at that."
0,We were looking for a decent place to go to and this seemed like good spot to check out.\n\nIt was easy to get in with no fuss line - we were offered each a free drink token when entering. \nWe went to the bar to use free drink - and bartender took th coupon n did not give us the drink. We asked once and he did not respond so we let it go. There was a female bartender and tall male bartender that was very nice an made good drinks.  Was a guy no sprayed beer on everyone - girls that were definitely not least bit classy-it was more like trashy! They wanted to fight for no reason- the security  didnt do anything about it nor kick out the trouble makers . I requested a song 3 times in on hour and in 3 hours could not play ! The Hispanic dj sucked and the other dj was good! \n\nIf you are looking for trashy place - check this place out! Defiantly disappointing !
0,The symphony hall is nice but the seats are not that high so watching a performance can be a challenge with so many heads in front of you.  The nutcrackers was disappointing. There was only a few moments that was very pretty. Some of the ballet dancers made some very noticeable mistakes. I have seen the nutcrackers while ago and it was a much better experience.
0,"The very best I can say about this place is that if you're looking for a deep fried heart attack you're sure to find it here.\n\nOver-salted, deep fried and virtually tasteless. I'm offended that they charged me for this food. It's bland, oily and the shells are deep fried for so long that if you're not careful you'll cut your mouth wide open. Ouch.\n\nTo add insult to injury it's way overpriced for the quality of food that you get. A real tacqueria wouldn't charge almost $4 for a measly carne asada taco. They just wouldn't. Theirs consists of chewy meat and some flimsy corn tortillas. Not worth it.\n\nThe people here are abrupt. Not rude, per se, but just not friendly. I'm sure there's a language barrier, just don't go here looking for friends is all I'm saying.\n\nI'd definitely try a different taco place unless you're so raging drunk that the only thing that will absorb the alcohol so you don't end up on the bathroom floor is greasy mexican food, then still don't go here. No, seriously, just lay on the cold tiles and it will be fine tomorrow. \n\nAvoid."
1,"We decided on delivery tonight because neither one of is wanted to do dishes.  Both the Katsu and BBQ Chicken were phenominal and delivery was timely.  Delivery guy cut through my freshly seeded lawn, that was my only complaint."
0,"Took our money and ran!!  He underbid the repair on the coach and then refused to finish the job and fix the coach for which he was already paid!! Hired a \""reputable\"" company to finish the job and will report him to BBB.  He is a thief!  Please use someone else!"
1,"The huai du bop (spelling?) at Koi is a must-have when I visit Phoenix (let's just say they know me there). A massive bowl of fresh greens, daikon radish, a bit of spice and sauce, and amazingly fresh, flavorful fish. A sashimi salad, essentially, and one of my all-time favorite meals. We often split one of these and add a roll for a meal fit for a queen!\n\nThe rolls are flavorful and while some of the old standards are there, of couse, they have some unique ones as well. I love their state-themed rolls: a take on a flavor or ingredient you might expect traveling these united states... in sushi form!\n\nAnother favorite is the all-vegetable roll (damn, the name escapes me), that uses cucumber instead of rice and seaweed. On a hot day in the middle of the southwest desert, this is a light lunch that allows you to enjoy their amazing sushi without feeling heavy when you leave.\n\nThe food is fresh and tasty, the service is fast and friendly. The space is small, but there always seems to be room for one more table, one more person at the bar. Depending on the weather, go out and enjoy your meal on the patio!\n\nThe wine list could be expanded, but they have a decent bar selection."
1,"Best effing oatmeal raisin cookie I've had in my entire life. Even if everything else on the menu sucked, this cookie alone would warrant the 5 stars. Fortunately everything else doesn't suck. Try it and see for yourself.  My other favorite is the turkey cranberry sandwich."
0,"Yes, it took me almost a year to write this review, but better late than never. Registering was easy and I had no issues there. My friend who I was running with and I didn't realize that it was best to get you number at the expo the Friday or Saturday before the race, so we ended up having to pay $20 to pick up our race numbers the evening of the race. Oh well, no big deal, but I wished I had realized that before hand. \n\nGetting to the race wasn't too bad, we took the tram to Mandalay Bay and walked the 15 minutes to the expo/waiting area. We waited for about an hour and a half, there were tons of people around, but no one from the race really \""directing traffic\"" and keeping everyone informed and updated of what was going on.  \n\nWe decided to make our way to the start line about 30 minutes before the start of the race. We were in the 35th coral and there was no good way to get to the start of the race besides going down the side of this hill and wondering around until we found our corral number. The corral numbers were pointless anyways, I don't think any really stuck to theirs. We waited about 30 minutes in the freezing cold until we got to the start line and off we went. \n\nWe spent pretty much the entire race dodging people, and zig zagging to avoid the walkers that were walking in the middle of the street, 6 or 7 in a row. With 44,000 people running a race I guess that is to be expected. \n\nThey did a good job of setting up timers on the streets every other mile or so, so you could keep track of your time. The bands were cool, but nothing I really paid attention to since I was listening to music on my ipod. \n\nThe finishing of the race was a total let down, I crossed the finish line and no one handed me a medal, I actually had to pick up my own medal, take off the plastic and put the damn thing around my own neck. Totally disappointing. I walked backed into the expo area and met up with my friend who had finished before me. \n\nWe went to make our way out of the expo area and were caught in a HUGE traffic jam of people. I took us about 20 minutes to finally reach a bend that lead from the expo back into the hotel. Someone had passed out and there hardly enough room to lay her down on the ground, let alone give her enough space. People were also trying to go in the opposite direction to get to a show. Thank god someone mentioned to us that they knew a short cut out of the hotel into the parking lot. That probably cut an hour off our wait to get back to the tram. We ended up very close to a taxi line (thank god!). The line was reeaaallly long, but the taxi was the best option. I think we finally got back to our room about 10pm.\n\nI heard they want to have 60,000 people for this years half marathon, I think that is the most ridiculous idea I have ever heard. I will never do this half again."
1,"Awesome food, awesome service. The best way to do teppanyaki without breaking the bank or having to drive down to the strip. We have been here many times for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. I highly recommend Eddy!"
1,"ABSURD portions! I've never seen so much food! (That's not a complaint, by the way; just an observation.) I liked the casual atmosphere and my BLT was delicious. Would return."
0,"2 days back, a guy from this company came to fix a stopped AC in my house. new house of 3.5 yrs old. The technician behavior was good, but he spent almost 1 hour and told me the circuit board in the furnace gone defective, and next day customer service told me the labour will be $420 to fit the new board. The board is under warranty from the manufacturer.\n\nWant to try with another co. Yesterday, I called another company to check. That technician fixed in less than 5 mnts, saying there is a switch which got tipped, so he put it back and the AC is running. I was in shock. But I happily paid their service call fee of $79.\n\nI paid $49 for the R&B service call, to get the wrong analysis.\nWhen reported this to this company, they refused to refund that amount. Now I planned to dispute the credit charge. \n\nBeware of knowledge of technicians. May be others are good, but the one came to my house, is not competent."
0,"I absolutely hate to do this because I would totally give this place a five star rateing. However, today was possibly one of the worst experiences ever...\nUsually love this place. The owner is always nice and we like coming here to visit this one worker cuz she's always nice but today we were helped by two girls who have pretty cruddy customer service. \nMy boyfriend got a vegan brownie sundae and asked for no fudge. The girl still put fudge on it, which was whatever. Then we asked to have the brownie warmed up since she failed to ask if we wanted it warmed up before hand. They took the ice cream off and just handed it to us in a cup (I honestly would have replaced every thing) They proceeded to warm the brownie and burnt it. Then 10 minutes later still no warm brownie. She said the brownie was soft but still chilly and asked if it was okay....I mean I guess we've been waiting a while so nevermind already..the icecream was half melted any way. So in result no warm brownie and melted icecream. They were sorry but didn't do much to fix the problem."
1,Outstanding customer service. Very accommodating and helpful. I highly recommend renting a boat from them.
1,Just moved here from Chicago and was nervous I would never find good Italian food or pizza like we had back home. I was blown away by Grandma's Sicilian pizza - you must get it! Their pasta with red clam sauce is to die for! I'm so happy this place is just minutes from my house. What a gem!
0,"I love the sushi and go there all the time but one time my boyfriend and I went after the gym and had the worst server ever. She was a total bitch. We ordered a philly roll and a scorpion roll and she was like \""just two rolls? Ugh.\"" And walked away. Like are you serious? There goes your tip. And she never got us drinks."
0,"The three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles. \n\nLast Sunday I called to verify the price of an item, a iPod Touch 8GB, and to also verify that it had a $50 gift card. Specifically asked if it was a gift card or a Fry's card and the girl told me it was a Fry's Card. So I spent an hour loading up my cart with items to pay and pick up at the store.  Shopping cart won't work - I keep getting an error. Call the store and explain and the gal does it on her computer so I recite the 10 items and item numbers. She says \""Oh I got an error.\"" Yea...well just like me. She does it again from the beginning...error again. Goes to get a supervisor and we go through the whole dog and pony show again...twice. Same result error. They tell me that they will go and get all of the items together and put them on will call and I can come pay at the store. They will call me when ready. No one ever calls. \n\nI call the next morning to see what happened. Talked to the specific super from the day before, says sorry about the call, but yes all items are on will call. I ask if at same price and deals and am told yes. \n\nDrive my happy a$$ all the way across town and guess what...yea, nothing on will call. Wait 20 minutes and the box comes up. Agent tells me that not all items are on the same price. Ugghh..specifically asked that in my call. Goes to talk to someone and 10 minutes later comes back and says no. Fine leave that item out. Rings it up and I ask about the gift card...yea you guessed it \""What gift card.\"" Same fire drill and I explain it all again in detail to him and gave the guys name I talked to on the phone. 10 more minutes a supervisor comes over and asks. Have to repeat the same story AGAIN. \n\nGrowing impatient as this deal is narrowing on 2 3/4 hours in total plus a 25 minute drive here and back. 15 more minutes of waiting and I tell the Agent, \""Dude this is just taking too long. Just take out the iPod Touch and I'll pay for the rest and go. Guy gets nervous and says ok just a minute AND LEAVES. \n\nA \""manager\"" came over a few minutes later. This is when it goes over the top. This stocky bald headed white guy approaches me and get this...he puffs up and says to me \""Is there a problem here?\"" Are you friggin' kidding me! Well yea, with your arrogant and aggressive puff up and comment, well yea there was an issue and now it is a problem. This from a \""Manager\"" no less. I geared for a comment, but then bit my lip and just said, \""You know what, this process has been far too painful and I just want to go now, so take the item off so I can leave.\"" This arrogant tool, gives me the passive-aggressive mean spirited \""Just trying to help\"" line before turning away. His arrogance was almost like he was happy he won this apparent battle in his mind's eye. Ridiculous! Yea you won...you won me spending my $400.00 using Amazon Prime\"" you idiot. \n\nOne last SNAFU for me was when the supervisor comes back and hands me a VOID receipt...yea you guessed it again, he voided the entire order and not just the iPod Touch taken off as I requested (all in front of the \""Manager\"" too I might add). Walked out completely empty handed and drove home.  \n\nThe three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles."
0,Ate here for dinner with a friend around 8pm on Jan 13. Had some rolls and appetizers. Woke up at 2am violently throwing up. Woke up again at 5am throwing up. My friend was sick all night as well and this was the only meal we both ate. Still feeling sick. \n\nWill never eat at Osaka again.
0,"They were out of Chilean Sea Bass, so we had to order the steamed Rock Fish.  This entre alone was $120.00.  It only barely fed one person.  All skull and bones.  Do not order this, it is a total major rip off.  Felt for my brother since he recommended this restaurant and I was afraid to askhim  what the total bill was.  I'm guessing $300 for three people. The rest of the meal was minimal and left us hungry.  Had to go to place in the food court nearby later for a snack."
1,"Man I looooove me some JAMBA JUICE!!!! I've been waiting for them to open one in the southwest.... The rest of them are so spread out across the valley in malls and the university PLUS the cluster of them on the east side and in Henderson, about time the southwest got some love!!! This one is RIGHT by my house too.... So convenient =]\n\n\nI finished a fast right on time for their grand opening and the season debut of the PUMPKIN SMASH!!!!! What I wait patiently for each year! I get the small and make it light, only 260 calories. And very much worth it! Haha best dessert ever! I've already visited the new location 3 times in the past week. This is going to be bad! Wish they did punch cards haha. I did get a receipt to do a survey and get buy one, get one next time! And I'm on it!!!!\n\n\nPS I need your # Jamba!! Gotta call in orders when I'm on the fly! Oh yeah, first Jamba with a drive thru-- BONUS!!!!!"
0,"Let me preface this with the crucial fact that I have not yet been to Hakkasan. But let me follow with two words that explain this 1 star rating: customer service. \n\nEveryone working in this industry should know and value the importance of customer service, especially in Las Vegas. People travel from all parts of the world to enjoy an extravagant weekend in the one&only Sin City. So to be mistreated, disrespected, and borderline harassed before even starting a vacation is unacceptable. \n\nLet me explain. \n\nI go to Vegas a lot. And I know a wonderful promoter who always hooks it up. She doesn't work for Hakkasan, so we went through a different promoter that my friend got the number for. Dan. He told us that our guys would have to pay - and that's fine. We understood, but didn't want to go to Hakkasan and pay over going to XS for free. \n\nThe text my friend sent was incredibly polite: \n\n\""hi sorry I think we're gonna pass cause we can get the guys into the other clubs for free. thanks anyway tho! I'll text you in the future :)\""\n\nAmong other things, he responded with this:\n\n\""Ur gonna favor free & have an experience prob bad because we dominate sundays vs. having time of your life which is ur coming to Vegas.\"" \n\n\""whoever u talking to is miss leading you\"" because XS charging is \""commonly known\""\n\nand repeatedly said that Hakkasan was the #1 club in the country. \n\n1) No need to put down other clubs or the fact that our guys don't want to pay\n2) Don't tell us we won't have fun unless we come to your club\n3) It's not all about being voted number 1 by a magazine, it's about customer service and relations and in the few months that Hakkasan has been open, they can't even beat a subpar tier 3 Vegas club on Yelp - that's probably due to poor customer service.\n\nIf this club expects to compete with XS, Marquee, & Surrender once the hype has died down, they should reevaluate how they treat potential guests at their club. \n\nI still plan on going to Hakkasan and I do look forward to seeing what all the hype is about. I believe that the owner of the club and those working have put a lot of hard work into making a new and exciting atmosphere for EDM lovers. But until I see for myself, my only impression of the club is through our interactions with the club's promoter - whose role is to represent and \""promote\"" the club. Instead, his aggressive assertion of Hakkasan's superiority to all other clubs in Vegas and condescending response at our polite refusal of his offer left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,"Another pleasant 4-star surprise!  Really had my doubts about this place.  The location hasn't fared too well over the years.  Was the Rib House a while back and then Stackers and it didn't seem big enough to be a full-fledged dining option.  \n\nBut the owners did a great job of remodeling.  The food is pretty good for what it is - burgers, sandwiches.  We ordered a reuben anda ham specialty sandwich.  The latter was delicious - honey ham, cheese and a fried egg.  As the Czechoslovakian Brothers Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd used to say, \""that's your funeral!\""  It was tasty.  Side order of tater tots was also very good.\n\nBeers were solid.  Decent selection of Charlotte craft brews and lots of cans.  We tried an I-77 IPA from Four Friends and an Old Chub can from Oskar Blues, which now has a brewery in Brevard, NC as well as Colorado.  Good stuff.\n\nService was smiley.  Too many TVs which nearly led me to give this place 3 stars.  I don't get the whole \""TV at every turn\"" thing.  It's ricockulous and an assault on the frickin' senses and makes me long for a good old fern bar, where that's right, the only decoration is a fern hanging on the wall.  But the generation X, Y and Z kids love their big 100-inch flat screen plasma LCD 3-D hi-def TVs, so rock on everybody!!!!"
1,"This is the third Italian place we've tried in the Uptown area and after being big fans of Prestos, this is our new favorite. Everything about it was great. From the location and view of the streets of Uptown to the fancy but casual (as previously stated) feel of the restaurant. \nI had the Vegetable Baked Ziti and it was delicious. My girlfriend chose the chicken marsala which was even better than the ziti. The prices were pretty reasonable as well. We will be returning. \nDidn't have a chance to check out the bar prices or drinks themselves, but it seemed like it would be a nice place to have a drink and enjoy some Sinatra.\n\nOn second visit, the shrimp toscana was awesome as well. Delicious shrimp with a little spice to the sauce.\n\nOn third visit, vegetable ziti and chicken marsala were still great."
0,"I'm sorry to be the first to really criticize this place....but it really was not good at all. I understand that it is a non profit place and it's there to help people, and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The BF and I went here this morning to get our coffee fix and to try it for the coffee tour of phoenix! It was a huge disappointment. I ordered an iced latte and he ordered a hot latte. The hot latte had no foam. Both lattes had a very strange flavor. We had both asked for 2% milk, but it tasted like she used half and half? or a milk substitute? It had a weird 'fake' quality about it. Further, the coffee was just about nonexistent. It was like when I was a kid and my mom would put a teaspoon of coffee in my milk because I liked the flavor.... not what I'm looking for at a coffee place and not what we paid 4$ a drink for. We both ended up throwing away over half of our drinks because they were so bad. The place has a cute look, but I will never be back. Ugh. \n\n\n\nPS It may be immature but I think it's funny that they have signs all around with their shortened name 'cok' heh. heh."
0,Requested the Mac and cheese vegetarian and got a meat plate.  Then not checked on for 10 minutes and then had to wait for a new order.  F this place.  If given the choice of any other restaurant.  You should choose another place.  I waited almost an hour for some macaroni and cheese.  I could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long this isht took.
1,I come here often because it's in my hood and who doesn't like frozen yogurt? I always get the cake batter yogurt. It's a mom and pop joint so they don't have a large selection but enough choices to choose from.\n\nThey have all my favorite toppings so I'm satisfied. The employees always greet me and service is never an issue. It's a cute place to take your kids and to satisfy your sweet tooth during the scorching Vegas summers.
0,Worst experience ever!!! I paid for an hour and left after 20 minutes. The lady working there was alone and took her sweet time in arranging everything as I was a walk in. She was way too rough and that was only my feet. When I told  her it hurt she laughed and continued to do the same thing. That's when I was like ok...I gotta go. I'll pay you and even give you a few dollars tip just so I can leave. Just awful! I'm shocked I'm not bruised up because of her.
0,"The two girls were arguing over who had to do my eyebrows. I went with my brother in law and one girl did his and one did mine. I could tell the girl was new and she needed help and some confidence. The the other worker was being petty and didn't want to help. So of course I got a half ass job on my eyebrows. \""Oh, you hardly need yours done I can't see any hairs.\"" Well I certainly woudln't spend money if I know there wasn't anything to wax. I hadn't even plucked them in months. I guess this is what I get for going to a poorly trained chain salon. I'll be going somewhere professional next time if I ever decide to do that again."
1,"The first time I had Thanksgiving lunch here with family and it was very good! They had a great variety of food, including salad bar, desserts, and a grill and a mixture of American, Asian, and Mexican dishes. One of my favorite desserts was mixing the orange sherbet with vanilla ice cream."
0,"Why is everyone standing around?\n\nIt was a slow night and they were obviously over-staffed. But no one was really anxious to help me out. I was shuffled from the battery center, to the front desk, to the service center and then stood  there awkwardly while the employees made casual conversation and no one told me there was a waiting area. \n\nI just came in to get a new battery for my car. Kinda peeved that I paid for installation, if you can even call it that. Autozone does it for free with purchase and I thought most places did too. Not these Pep Boys. I should have went elsewhere but my car needed it bad. Oh well... live and learn."
1,"SIMPLY THE BEST!    Had Lunch Express cater an office party and they did a top notch job!  The food was just wonderful and the presentation was much better than what you would think a simple little lunch-stop would do.  The are NOT just a \""Lunch Express\"" go-to place, but also breakfast!  Joe really cares and is wonderful at what he does. If you haven't tried this place--please DO!  Bravo and Thanks!"
0,"Used to come in this place quite a lot, but my last time was so crummy I wont be back. brought my kids in here and it's changed. You know how it is when you really like and know a place then you go in and it's different. Service is off, food is off, and prices have gone up. Not worth the hassle. One crappy night at this place was enough to lose me for life. Later!"
1,"Close your eyes and imagine standing on top of the 920 foot tall stratosphere over looking beautiful Vegas.  Now, climb on to the Big Shot and be prepared to be shot up at 45 mph another 160 feet higher experiencing 4G's of force followed by what feels like 5 seconds of free floating followed by a negative 1G's force drop back down.  If you didn't pee yourself just thinking about it, then you need to ride this thing!  I consider myself a thrill ride junkie and I have never experience anything like this is my life.  Buy the day package and get to ride all three rides for the entire day.  Enjoy the ride during the day then come back at night for a totally different experience.  I deducted one star due to the location- it is so far down the strip from anything- do yourself a favor and take the bus to get there.  We decided to walk from the Palazzo because the Stratosphere \""looked\"" really close.... Almost 2 miles later and we finally got there."
1,"Cute menus playing off the restaurant's name by having the menu in photo albums whose concept comes from the owner's travels and including little touches and culinary influences on the menu. With a night time menu in addition to the brunch/lunch menu, Caf\u00e9 Souvenir is a perfect spot to either start or end your day. Brunch menu served daily from 7am to 4pm."
0,"I've tried this place once before..had d Gyro with d white sauce added top of d meat. 2nd time the meat was bland, sauce on d side. Driving off d Hwy I've seen their big poster advertising their Gyro with the white sauce on top..coming from NY where I've had n enjoy Gyro sandwiches all d time the sauce is on top of meat along with all the only stuff that goes with d sandwich..Why on d side? I won't b eating at this place ever again..can't get past d bland tasting meat..sauce on d side no big deal..But..why not b authentic n add it to d sandwich the way it shld b done..I guess I of cld told them to add d sauce onto d sandwich lik it was done w/d first Gyro sandwich I ever had there. Taking it to go d 2nd time it was on d side..took a taste of d sauce-less meat..it had no flavor...really bland..it needs that sauce big time..Will I go back? Nope..looking for a new n better tasting Gyro place.."
1,"I must be a sucker for wine bars....they are just so good! I went to Timo after finding it on Yelp while hiking North mountain with my step mom Deb. We were hiking and, of course, thinking about food...lol. So we went to Timo, which is this cute little place that is largely hidden from the road by big trees. We sat on the patio for Sunday brunch. The service was great, very attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful....so relaxing. They didn't even treat us badly despite our being dirty and (probably) smelly. We shared the bacon and fig (?) pizza and the rocket salad. The pizza was HUGE and ridiculously good....the pizza was piled with bacon and sweet onions...so flavorful. The salad was also good...it had sort of weird dried raspberries and blueberries on it that were almost like croutons because they were crunchy but had the flavor of the fruit...yum. I would definitely come back here again...maybe next time I'll try the benedict (which also looked pretty fabulous)."
0,"I have been coming here for a couple years and they are gettin progressively worse instead of better. \n1) They took the keurigs out of the room. DUMB. There is no in room coffee.\n2) quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever seen for a Hotel casino is this, they have a kitchen, two restaurants, and NO ROOM SERVICE. WTF?!?!? However there are delivery services from local area restaurants. NACHO DADDY was  BADASSSSSSSS and totally recommended.\n3) The casino hosts are extremely hard to reach and Larry doesn't return calls or messages. If you need a host, ASK FOR DARREN. He's a Big black dude and he gets stuff done! If it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't return."
1,"I love this place. I am one of these people who love spa services and love a good deal.\n\n Here is what I recommend. Get on the email list for SWIHA, and you will get emailed all sorts of deals. They also have fun and intersting events if you are into the whole mind, body, spirit thing.\n\nThey offer free hypnosis, toe reading, and life coaching sessions on their first Friday events. Those are held in the evening and start with some sort of presentation  that is of a personal developement/spiritual nature, and then you break off and get to try one of their treatments. If KC Miller is speaking, you are in for a treat. She is the owner of the school, and a dynamic speaker.\n\nAside from the First Friday (they call it Gifts and Graces) they provide a free  hypnosis session, as their students need to practice,  so call on that one. It all depends on the student how well this goes. I've done it a few times, and some of them are great, and some are still learning. This is true everywhere, but the difference here is that it's free. You can always tip, and I do that. I have been hypnotized for getting organized and starting exercise programs, etc. I admit that I am still working on these things, so the hypnosis wasn't a magic bullet in my case! LOL\n\nThey also have massage there. You have the choice of a student or graduate. The prices vary depending on whether you get a student or not. I always request the student to save money. \n\nMy very favorite thing, however, is their facials. I always buy a package when they have their coupons out, and it makes it so that the facials are less than $20 each!!!!  Call and ask them when their next coupon comes out. It's a great way to go and get your face really cleaned nicely and relax."
0,"Only had to work a half day one day last week so thought I would try lunch here and see if the experience was better than dinner time was.  Unfortunately, it was even worse.  \n\nThe place was pretty busy so I figured maybe I had misjudged the first time.  I ordered a gyro sandwich, falafel, and a greek salad.  Right after I ordered they loaded a new block of gyros meat onto the skewer to cook.  Unfortunately, they cut my meat off just moments after they started it so the meat was cool and had a congealed fat mouth feel.  I couldn't take more than a couple of bites.  The falafel that had been so good last time tasted like a salt lick!  Whoa boys...back off the salt shaker a bit there!  The greek salad was nothing special at all.\n\nFinally, the ladies preparing the food look like they are simply miserable back there.  Sometimes they would call out an order when they finished it...other times the hot part of the order would sit for 10 minutes (not under any heat source) until the guy taking orders at the counter noticed it was there and called the number. \n\nI probably won't be back as I had nausea the rest of the day (probably from the barely warm gyro meat).  There are a lot of gyro places in the valley.  It would probably be best to go to one that shows greater care in their food prep."
1,"Really enjoyed my first visit. I will spend my money here again. I had the ribs, crab soup, house cut chips w/ pimento cheese, sweet potato mash and salad. Everything was VERY good. I will be going back and bringing friends and family with me."
1,"Visited Thai Basil again yesterday while on my way back to the DREADED DMV. The DMV Sucked as usual, but Thai Basil was wonderful as always! I had the Red Curry Chicken & had it Thai Hot. Let me say it was the perfect amount of heat. The sauce is Sweet & hot & DELICIOUS! My husband had the Yellow Curry Chicken and was just as impressed. The food comes out in no time & the atmosphere is very ZEN if you get my drift. The music is tranquil & you can always hear birds gently tweeting in the back ground. A great break away when you have to face the dreaded DMV or on break from a hectic day at work. GOOD STUFF!!!"
0,Ugh. Never again. This is by far the WORST Chinese food I have EVER had. Trust me on this one! STAY AWAY!
1,"My go to local source for spices\n\nAs a cooking enthusiast, I was thrilled to see that Penzey's opened a new store near East Townee Mall earlier this year.  I almost exclusively rely on their products for dried spices and seasonings.  Other than some eclectic Asian spices, I can pretty much find whatever I need there.\n\nThe store is basically a carbon copy of the store on University Ave.  While things are sorted by alphabetical order, they do have separate sections for things like baking ingredients, chilis, pepper etc., which can be a little confusing when you get to the P section and can't find pepper because it is in a separate section.  But it's not a large store, so eventually you'll figure it out.\n\nThe staff is generally pretty laid back.  They greet you when you enter, let you do your shopping and are available when you have a question.\n\nThey sell spices in various quantities, but remember that spices have a shelf life of six to twelve months, so the half pound bag of cumin may seem like a bargain on a per ounce basis, but if you are going to use an ounce per year, stick with the smaller quantity.  \n\nEven though Penzey's can be a little more expensive than your local supermarket, the quality level of the product is consistently high and because it is a specialty purveyor, the product on the shelf is fresher\n\nSome of the products I really love:\n * Pure vanilla extract - the gold standard for vanilla\n * Ground chipotle pepper - infuses a wonderful smoky flavor to my Mexican dishes\n * Extra Fancy Vietnamese Cassia Cinnamon - The cinnamon choice of America's Test Kitchen, 'nuf said\n * Dutch process high fat cocoa powder - make a chocolate cake with this stuff and you'll have the unconditional love of your kids, trust me\n * Whole Special Extra Bold Indian Black Peppercorns - the \""Bold\"" is in the description for a reason, these peppercorns pack some serious heat."
0,Chicken sandwich was mediocre and Mac and cheese was not the slightest bit cheesy. Was not impressed.
1,"My experience of, and love for Toast can be summarised in three words: vegetarian cooked breakfast.  The ultimate weekend treat, for about \u00a36 you get a plate of many delicious items including awesome home-made baked beans and a sweet potato fritter.  When we lived round the corner, my flatmates and I couldn't keep away, especially as the place has a breezy, relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff and good coffee - the perfect place to while away a few hours over the Sunday papers, though I'd advise turning up early as it does get pretty busy.\n\nHave to confess ignorance of their meaty offerings, but friends of mine have told me good things about their bacon rolls.  Haven't tried their evening menu either, as it seems a little further out of the range of student budgets, but if the tasty breakfast is anything to go by, I'd expect it to be something special!"
1,"The Pink Spot is definitely my new spot for ice cream. I got an amazing brownie sundae there and it took me two days to eat it!  \n\nThey also offer frozen bananas, which makes me feel \nlike I'm at a Bluth Banana Stand (a la Arrested Development). \n\nAND! They deliver!"
1,Really good Frozen Custard. Located in the shadow of the Stratosphere on the North End of the Strip.  You will be going to this place for the yummy fruit custards.  It is not in the best part of town so it could be classified as a hole-in-the-wall.  You order at a small walk up window.  If memory serves me correctly there really wasn't any seating or we just chose to stand near our cars while eating our custard.
0,"I had originally intended to submit an eloquent review of the horrifying service provided by Cox - but clearly it's not worth spending the time.  Mine would just be another in a long line of one-star reviews.  Suffice it to say that I am no longer - and will never again be - a Cox customer.  I hope all those who have a choice will take the time to read the reviews here, take them to heart, and find another provider.  Cox should be ashamed of both their unethical business practices and their horrifyingly bad service."
